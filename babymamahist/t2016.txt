When I was young, it was love (or the idea of love) that was my muse. Just a whiff of it would propel me through the day. Love made me feel creative and attractive. Love fueled me. Love made more love. Bringing children into my world made me look at love much differently.  So did a long-term relationship … and a broken heart.  What about a love lost? Or a love never fully realized? How do we process those feelings in a healthy way so we can be better lovers?  How do you heal a heart? When do we learn to truly love ourselves? How do we give love—pure, unselfish love—and expect nothing in return? What about teaching our children to love? How do we guide them into healthy relationships? How do we guide ourselves into healthy relationships? If you aren’t a good lover, can you fully recognize true love? Exercise— that’s what keeps us strong, right? The repetition of it, over and over, is what makes muscle memory. I’m saying it… We’ve gotta exercise our LOVE muscle. In ALL WAYS. Being a better lover in everything I do, I want that. And if you want that, I want it for you, too. Happy LOVE LIFE my dear, beautiful friends! xoxo  © 2016 . BabyMama   HOLD UP!!!

 BAFANA Bafana star Andile Jali’s baby mama, Unathi 
Nombona, is said to have found love. Unathi is alleged to have won the heart of another 
former football star, Siyabonga Nkosi, who used to play for Kaizer Chiefs. 
Unathi dumped Andile, who plies his trade in Belgium and 
is currently engaged to fitness guru and former Diski Divas star, 
Nonhle Ndala.After the breakup, Unathi allegedly took a break from 
serious relationships, but seems to have made up her mind about 
finding another soulmate.Sources close to her told Sunday Sun she 
and Siyabonga have been seeing each other for a while and have been going out a 
lot together.Describing her as an all-time-bragger, a source said 
Unathi (31) has been posting cheerful photos of herself and Nkosi (35) on some 
of their outings.In some photos, Unathi and Siyabonga are seen having fun 
with Unathi’s friend, actress Zola Nombona who stars in e.tv’s Zibondiwe.“Unathi works in Durban and Siyabonga often visits her 
on the coast. She’s madly in love with Siya and it looks like 
they are both enjoying being together,” said a source. Another source even claimed Siyabonga quit playing 
football to spend more time with Unathi.Another source added that she’s hoping this relationship 
works as both lovebirds are around the same age.“Unathi was five years older than Andile, which might 
have had a negative impact on their relationship,” added another source. 
A third source added: “Unathi’s into cute soccer 
players. Her friends are happy for her because they think the two are a match 
made in heaven.”When Sunday Sun contacted Siyabonga for 
comment, he said: “I’m not dating anyone at the moment. I’m not dating Unathi,” 
then hung up on the SunTeam.Unathi was not available for comment.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");photo-group

Recent Comments 25.01.2016  at 1:43 pm By BellaNaija.com 119 Comments   Since news broke this morning on LIB about Wizkid’s alleged second baby mama, the pop star has stayed away from social media and has so far not officially confirmed or denied the reports. While we wait for his official statement, here are a few things to note about the lady who just might be the mother of Wizkid’s second son.  According to reports, the alleged baby mama and Wizkid have been in a quiet relationship for a while and when she became pregnant things were kept on the low till she gave birth and shared the name of her son with her Instagram followers. She announced the baby’s name to be Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun – which is Wizkid’s exact first, middle and last names – but she has now edited the name on her Instagram page to simply reflect her baby’s initials which are AIB.   After a little digging we found out her name is Binta Diamond Diallo and she is from Guinea.  She is also friends with US reality star Natalie Nunn who told her congratulations on the birth of her half-Nigerian son on Twitter a couple of days ago. She also loves Wizkid’s music and a lot of his songs off the “Ayo” album are her go-to songs. Binta was definitely spotted with Wizkid when he was in Houston in May 2015 (about 9 months ago) for an Industry Nite performance and in some photos she posted on Instagram Wizkid can be seen in the background.   A couple of days ago Wizkid shared on his Twitter account a cryptic “T Baby Forever” message which a lot of people assumed was about Tania Omotayo (click here) Photo Credit: Instagram – @bluediamond224 | Facebook – BintaDiamond Living & Celebrating the African Dream!

Tuface coaching Wizkid on how to create your own tribe, Annie coaching Tania on how to be the model stepmother of all nations! No wonder these two couples are friends. @ Concerned lmao.. Smh no b only Nation. Well some should check of Annie gave a shout out to Tonia via IG on her new step son. Tania, pele. But we kept telling you to move on. Baby no 2 Tania Omotayo , how far ?  you are the next Annie Idibia.. so  you’ve got to wait , 3 more babies  to go …lol Funny thing is that Annie and Tania seem to be friends. They always shoutout at each other on Instagram. Really sad for her if this is really true. She seem really kindheartered. @jayboogie of Life😂 @Jayboogie 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅why are U wicked like this?????? Chair BTW, how old is this Wizkid?? What’s wrong with all these dudes & Mama baby Syndrome??? Oh lord Tania Baby , he’s so not worth it #NEXT#. I gerrit if it’s just one baby mama then he brings baby mama #2 mtchew smh. I knew she was from Guinea with by her name “Diallo”. She sure found her some Nigerian $$$$$. Folowing right into 2Face’s footsteps. Hopefully Tania is wise enough not to be a “Annie”. There’s nothing fat about this bone to be patient for. And please, don’t come for me BN readers,. You don’t like my comment, move along! Taink you! You flatter yourself ..no one’s coming for you .. ..look above you….ur comment na photocopy. Olu, thank u jare These young lads will learn sooner or later! A hard head makes a soft a@s!! Baby was born in the U.S so child support rules apply fam!! O_o Congrats guy… And to Mama baby, e ku eww omo o!! I came here to comment but I don’t even know say again….*sighs
Thank God for safe delivery wonders shall never end….
Dis our young celebs aint disiplined sha……..
i wonder the kind of babes opening  legs for them either “what exactly do they want? Nawa ooo. if this story is actually true, my dear Tania OmoTayo u DERSEVE WAY BETTER OOO
Run for your dear life if you get sense… ghen ghen… where is that appointed popcorn seller??? this is  an upgrade o……….*runsawaywhiledodgingpurewatersatchets* Lol i find this so funny Now is the time for Durex or Gold circle to have an ambassador and relaunch or smthn. A lot of our Nigerian celebrities have forgotten these brands  are in the market. These celebrities and even regular Nigerians need sex education for adults. I wonder if ppl are not even concerned about STD’s. Lol KUNU PLEASE!!!! listening to hopsin “baby mama” RN Wait o, are these people aware that HIV and other serious life threatening STI’s are real? or nah?
I am starting to think most of these men are allegic to Condom and do not believe they can catch any illness
Tufiakwa!!!
All the same congratulations! @sonia paloma HIV is real but it’s curable. It’s no longer deadly. Many Nigerian celebrities already have it and STI is nothing. As long as, they are taking their medication. And there’s been many cases where spouses or partner dont even contract it. Nigeria has one of the largest number of people living with HIV, and it’s disappointing that they will rather brush it under the rug as opposed to address such epidemic. As usual, Nigerians are in denial. All those sudden deaths, sickness, people are dying left, right and center but nobody will disclose what the sickness is a high probability is HIV/AIDS, where they didnt go for testing or found out too late. My cousin, is a pharmacist in Abuja and it’s a high percentage in the north especially among young women. He said, dont let those pretty face fool you, many Nigerians are suffering. Some of the men have it, going for treatment but won’t disclose it to their wives or girl.
I had an uncle who died of AIDS, but till today few family members knew. His wife actually knew after death. But family and friends said it was cancer. THERE IS NO CURE FOR AIDS!!!! It is still a very deadly disease. How can you make such a false and misleading statement???? There is NO CURE for HIV yet. It can only be medically managed to slow its progression. There is no cure for HIV. The incidence of the disease, among certain groups, is increasing rapidly. The prevalence is also growing because it has moved from a death sentence, in countries where screening and ART treatment are routine, to a chronic disease. Nevertheless, it is remains a burden on the individual, their family and the larger society. Please don’t post inaccurate information. Do some research and learn well well what you are talking about. @everybody  Sorry guys, I didn’t explain myself better. I know it’s bot curable. I was being sarcastic as to the reason many still live a reckless life knowing the consequence of it. They feel like HIV will not kill them, and if they do certain things it will cure them from the virus or prevent it from AIDS. They didnt get the memo Hmmmm. This comments section na my room today! Oya o! See gist. Tania wassup??? ***He seem to like light skinned ladies***More money, more women – more problems!! Congrats dear! This ‘babymama’ business is fast growing and becoming  quite competitive , and you women say you want Gender equality , equal respect and recognition in the society ? Well , not like this ! You’re not ready ! Na these thirsty hoes make it hard for us to seek gender equality.  We will keep fighting regardless of the high level of hoeism! Lmao.. Your comment cracked me up Hahaha! Lol @ high level of hoeism ! Choi! It’s not our fault. Women like this stay throwing us under the bus. All dem side chicks, mistresses and baby mamas are really destroying the image of women. These women also fall under the umbrella of feminism. After all, they CHOSE their path despite how deplorable we may find it. Frankly, the only hoe I see in all this is Wizard. Bruhhh….. Kí ló dé, ṣe àṣìṣe ni? Sigh 😩😩it’s also his choice. Tania Omotayo – you see your life on the outside in the playground? Se o ri aiye e ni ita gbangba. Dumb girl forming solidarity with annie idibia. Did we not warn you that this your suffer head of yesterday na stories that touch of today? I want to flog this giirl madly. Haha how can we all see this coming yet you the main character missed this coming. Haha. Step mother of life. @jide u too funny. “you see your life….playground” hahaha Tania…even Michael Jackson cannot eat popcorn to this Lol Michael Jackson kwa? I have retired for you Nigerians loool Oh well, passport things maybe.
 And bf u all come for Wizkid (who needs to change that his moinker by the way), many of your entertainers have “abroad” babies. So many of them….married and single. Nothing new.
 One of the Okoye boys too (not Paul) gat a child  in the US too.  Americana  mama is paid to shut up so she won’t spoil their happy family brand. And yes, the wife knows T-Baby should go to mentor Annie for coping skills if she’s still determined to die there. If it’s the case, then it’ll be a damn shame…and she’s ain’t from a poor home, why the desperation? Annie Idibia, if u are the one encouraging Omotayo to stick there abeg,stop. Carry your cross yourself. If you’re comfortable with  “long-suffering” “emotionally battered” ,as your second and third names, this should not be this girl’s portion. See how this vibrant  lady  don age due to stress.
OMOTAYO, FORCE YOURSELF: PICK YOUR DIGNITY THIS TIME AND GO!!! DON’T REDUCE YOUR MARKET VALUE AGAIN LIKE THAT!!! I don’t want to be Tania Omotayo right now, that awkward moment when your Ayodeji just broke your heart. Kepler my dear. Sending some e-hugs you way cause you will need it. I’m so happy Wizkid is following God’s instruction to “go ye forth and multiply” . More Lube to your Kajones HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA || SO FUNNY WizKid!!! small man with plenty action! Hahahahahaha!!! Tania come holla at ur boy! Even your boo get a boo….and sons! So these young men wld jus be going about nacking raw and they somehow know how to locate the very fertile women. Popcorn plix! I will comeback for comments am a patient sombori, bella9ja pple no disappoint abeg Ki lo n se awon omo yi . Why do some adults behave so irresponsibly and tamper with the life a child by not taking adequate protection. Bringing children they won’t be totally there for into the world. Spending lots of money, buying things money can buy is not what a child needs the most, time, nuturing, attention, closesness is the number one need of a child. Which i don’t think Wizkid can provide, he’s all over the place now, he’s not mature enough to be a dad yet.
All this women too with no intergrity, dignity nor pride, spreading their legs open for all sundry regardless of when D has been, e gbagbe atubotan ni. I pity all the children that get caught in all this web.
I remember when you’ll sweat blood before woman go gree your own, when it was a shameful act to fall pregnant outside marriage.
Pleas those who truly love Tania should encourage her not to throw her life away  by waiting for this boy and not have to endure a marriage with him all in the name of love. All that glitters is not gold, Tania don’t do like that aunty wey dey shine teeth for public but in the deepest part of her heart, she just dey endure. Move forward with your life, there are good men out there. One that will respect, adore and cherish you. Wizkid boutta increase his performance fees cos of child support.. Rotfl.. Dear Tania God will take care of you Poor tania kpele, please leave this guy abeg he’s not worth it at all. na wa baby daddy gist can bring out the apkroko in somebody, see me waiting for comments like someone who doesn’t have work Na ‘long-throat’ cause am  … but wait o ..no wonder naija girls dey bleach anyhow  …na soso yellow girls all these small boys dey chase around. …..and Tania Omotayo is a PAID EMPLOYEE to ACT as Wizkid’s girl. and to name the kid exactly the same, that is so “no chill” , this is one competitive girl.  Woah. *singing*….Wizzybbaby BABA NLAaaaa……… I can actually flee the glee on how people would comment( i am not an exception)
Hehehehe… this is too juicy eh And the drama goes on and on… Who’s next???
Poor Tania I feel for you girl. I don’t feel for her. She was too unreasonable, she should have left him since. She’s not on his level at all, in class, in education, in everything, I always wonder why she agreed to date the loser in the 1st place. She allowed someone that’s not up to her, to disregard her and disrespect her severely and severally, publicly. It’s very shameful. I hope you finally have the sense to leave. This boy has shown you time after time that he has no regard for you. And he’s really spoiling your “market” if you don’t know. It’s a pity that your friends couldn’t advise you, or perhaps you didn’t listen to them. hmmmn no b wizzy fault o.DAT gal just wan  be he baby mama. Young boys of these days are very fertile  oooo. Na jst to sneez few times na pikin go pop out.  As for me I tap into this new buisness venture in d year 2016. Na to open nursery around lekki area. Give baby mama time off to do other thinz Rotflmao! You BNers are the best for your comments alone. @shady has come up with business on top baby mama drama. Hahahaha just passing… BN pls when will u start to share some popcorn and drinks while we sit and watch how our celebs baby mama contest chart goes on?? I bet you all, some or should I say most of these entertainers are walking around with HIV/STIs. So, they don’t care. They are sharing it. Their wives are aware, some of their girlfriends are aware so, they stay because they’ve been exposed to it. So, why should they leave? I agree.there is got to be HIV and other STDs in this mix that we can’t see. Belle is just conspicuous and can’t be hidden. I am the official popcorn seller today here. Halls at your girl peeps lol. I full ground here. I have salted and sugar too im nt sure y i got angry on seeing n reading dis. oh well, Tania isnt a baby n she shuld knw dt dis shuld b a wake up call for her. hw irresponsible r d youths of today jor??? I’m feri dump folded *in Falz’ voice*  okay back to the matter at hand, since the baby mama thing is now a lucrative business, I’m not gonna be surprised if any lady starts to unearth what transpired between her and a famous celebrity. But seriously I don’t know why Tania hasn’t left Wizkid before now. IMO All these contraceptive people should come out and rebrand oooo..Things are taking a different turn..Women falling our hand since 1960.See the smally that she opened leg for instead of insisting on a condom or drinking a morning abi na afternoon after pill…Let us see how this Wizkids’s small change that is making him entice his seniors will multiply 10years from now..He should just be called Whizman, using the name Whizkid to give people kids. Nwa ojooooo. Asili gbakute Nigerians…How e take concern una? Look at irrelevant ppl talking abt how they advised Tamia lol..She doesnt know any of you and neither does Wizkid…..Some of una don do abortion tire and some will drink wizzies cum like milk shake and be baby mama 3……Holier than Christ freaking naija ppl….Wizkid is not ur youth pastor or role model for whatever u lot profess as ur standards for morality….his a young entertainer with money and in his line of work a lot of girls are bound to be pregnant for him……its just the real world and not the deluded ideal world yall live in…..his already made enough money to take care of 2 kids and 2 women if he secures his finances wisely….why dont u guys for onve worry about getting somewhere first abi na una sister wizzy give belle??…news is not even confirmed yet and all u Judge Judys don pronounce judgement finish..ndi uchu if you love tania for ever so why did you go have a child with a second lady  thats sound ignoring. hope tania will not rush to get preggos to keep her man   ..like anna banner tinz I don’t get the whole point of sharing these images on social media, this are issue you celebrate in private with your love ones, considéring it’s a sensitive matter. When stupid men mess around with opportunist like this , this is what happens. It’s all smiles now, but we all know how this story will end an angry and spiteful baby mama. As for Tania I hope she walks out with her head up, no women deserve this from any man. And you guys quite calling her stupid. Okay, she’s very smart. Tania the most gorgeous dumbest foolish girl on the planet getting all her advice from Anne Idibia. You are so dumb. Hang in there and wait, He will marry you in 2020 when naijgagistlive warned you – you blocked her and privatised your Instagram. Ewu, – you are such a beautiful yet dumb girl Ahn ahn wizkid you don vexx? No respect for family name again,and who born all the ‘magas’? Dear Lord deliver us from #Yorubademons and may you give them the wisdom to always use a condom🏃🏿 Please direct the prayer to Flavor as well who’s Igbo, and 2face who’s Tiv. The Yoruba boys slander is getting old and boring. Well, this kind activities are not new to the entertainment industry.  King Sunny Ade has how many kids by how many women?
FELA has how many kids by how many women?
2face
Bob Marley
Diddy
Kwam1 And the list goes on and on and on…. Being a baby mama is now a full time job! oya ladies, please send your CV to the ministry of baby mama’s and side chics, all applicants be forewarned the selection process will be extremely intense & competitive so please be prepared to step up your A-plus thot game or else nothing for you..
Only qualification required is that you are able to poke me on the side and know your place while I show off my main chic in public, your silence will be greatly rewarded.. ask 2baba, OBO & whiskey …. 😀 yes, their friendship  started from when  2face & Wizkid did that  Hennessy Artistry gig .  lol, so Annie coached her to be patient i guess? . as someone said earlier, 2 babies down , 3 to go . lmao the question is WHY HAS TANIA FALLEN PREGNANT ALL THIS WHILE i mean they been together so long too right typo: WHY HASNT TANIA FALLEN PREGNANT too u kinda get point oh, mayb she insist wizzy use protective all the time, or she use drug later, who knows i pray for the day several NAIJA celebs or some of these hoes they been fking will get FULL BLOWN aids, to serve as a warning to all others I get the sentiment behind this comment, but this is harsh. Plus, I don’t think it will make people change their behavior. this is such a mess………… f8ck bois everywhere, greedy hoes getting preg cos of lil fame and cash………….. T BABY FOREVER………… CONTINUE ……………….after 3 to go as someone said, then dont worry ur pretty head , na u get the ring and white wedding plus bella naija full coverage .. aii………….stay put dearie ………… u sef go born ur own!!!!!……. i wonder if she has parents sef? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha this killed me Baby mama is a very lucrative business someone is collecting 300k + asking for official car while I am here with my b.sc collecting 60k salary Tania!! Tania!!! Make I put mouth for dis ting, leave Wizkid alone o!! Build yourself, start again! Move on!!!!!!! Don’t listen to Annie o!!! Poor Tania – this is what happens when women don’t believe in themselves. It will be a sad story if she sticks with him. Really sad. Tania pls I beg you move on Don’t these celefools fear for their lives (I know most of them are brainless)? How could they be having unprotected sex just like that? Do they really think they are immune to HIV or STDs? God knows how many unprotected sex they have had in the past. Everywhere they go, they have sex (Unprotected), from Ghana to Namibia, from Uganda to Lesotho, from Kenya to Haiti. Oga o. Tania, am sure you reading or a friend will send to you, I AM AVAILABLE for you ohhhh My question is this, is it that when they’re high they forget what CONDOM is. Like someone said, most of these celebrities have diseases and probably their partner knows or have it too so he/she gat to stay. Its a shame Feminist idealism ….truly good to bed.. Bellanaija I wanted to help yall out here with an interesting topic Well some east African friends and I were discussing Diamond Platinumz (the Tanzania crooner and hit maker) and Zari the Ugandan socialite and mother of 3 (before he met Diamond) he supposedly has had a baby girl with few months ago,  Well most of East Africa dont believe its his considering Zaris reputation. Every one is giving Diamond Pressure to take a DNA and he is in lvoe and trust his woman and said HE will not and personally i think he has a right to say he wont, if he knows his woman well (even if they only dated for 6 months), and know thats baby is his. They should leave him alone sha.  But anyway so during the discussion another fellow nigerian with us also chimed in and said  thats no big deal cos statistics show 5-10% of kids in nigerian married homes DO NOT BELONG TO THE MEN of which most of these men dont know. I wassshocked? really? 5%- 10% – Bella is it true, have you heard these statistics.  please lets post this controversial topic – because id love to know what people think – the discussion about DNA – how many kids in average nigerian married homes do not belong to the husband. years ago a gorgeous christian loving neighbor with 5 kids whose husband had won the green card lottery and traveled to US, finally filed and decided after settling down for the lady to join with all 5 kids, cut long story short, you know how american embassy lately will do DNA before allowing kids to enter with green card and stuff, anyway sha, None of the 5 kids belong to the man. Imagine that,. Not even one.  The most controversial story in our neighborhood in 2014. See shame. The Secret Lives of Baba Segi’s Wives, a novel by Lola Shoneyin.
Whatever, just take care of all God’s children. As in ehn, the way these kiddos let loose their stuff and spray babies everywhere, you go fear. When will wiz borrow himself some brain? One baby mama aint enough stress already? Its as if the fear of hiv and stds is not even there for these kids. My dear they are not allergy.they are just lazy,i mean take your condom there finish and dispose yourself cause there something called TURKEY BASTER you don’t know but your baby mama is well informed. siging Even ya boo get a Boo *gone to bed* So a guy cheats and flirts but there is this particular girl he loves and adores. Hey, if at this point you still believe that nonsense, then youre very ignorant and naive BELLA QUOTING LIB with her link embedded
So now you are  partner sites  abi, no wonder, It all makes sense now
Sharing traffic abi? It’s nothing new, BN usually gives credit (as they rightly should) when another site breaks a big story first, whether it’s LIB or SDK or whoever, with a link to the story. There are many past examples. abi all dis male celebs no get condom size ni? Haha,the company must hear about this…….the rate is becoming alarming! *sighs* Babymama business booming since the time of Fela. Tani bae..I see what you’re going… Modelling karrueche. If that’s the business model, ,carry go, after all no work for naija.  Make your money, get your endorsements, launch a career off the back of this gigolo. But if na love, my hand no dey o. The only thing this auntie no get ba shame. I just imagined that small boy on top of her. Nawao You love her but here you are airing her dirty laundry to strangers. With friends like you who needs enemies. why is Tania getting trolled ?
what has she done to deserve all this abuse?
is it a crime to be a loving and supportive girlfriend? please direct all your insults to the accused/suspect.. She’s not getting trolled. Most people who are abusing her are just mad because she’s such a sweet person and doesn’t deserve to be in this messy situation. It’s not a crime to be a loving and supportive girlfriend, but it’s a crime not to love yourself and it’s also a crime to be naive and irrational. This guy has disrespected her time after time, she had the opportunity of leaving him ages ago, and she didn’t. Now this, that’s why people are mad. No one is trolling at her, people are just mad. If someone doesn’t have regard for you, you shouldn’t give them the opportunity to continue to do so. He just shamed the poor girl publicly.

 The former special adviser on media and publicity to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Reuben Abati, has voiced his opinion on the entire Davido vs. Sophie and Dele Momodu baby mama saga.  Reuben Abati Reuben Abati in an opinion piece on his Facebook page advised Davido, Sophie and her uncle, Dele Momodu, not to give unnecessary publicity to little Imade Adeleke. He wrote: “They should not forget there is a child involved. They have suddenly made Imade Adeleke, the most famous victim of Baby Mama-Baby Papa palaver in Nigeria. Both Davido and Sophie and their supporter’ clubs should please protect the baby and not make her a poster child for that kind of subject.” READ ALSO: How David And Baby Mama Sign Peace Accord Papers The piece, written in the form of a dialogue between Abati and a friend, analysed the ongoing social media war of words between Davido and Dele Momodu and the public’s “enjoyment” of the sordid details revealed each day like on some bad soap opera. “But me, I am enjoying the story oh,” one of Abati’s characters says. While the other replies: “Of course, too many sadists in our land enjoy other people’s misery. Abati, however, pointed out what was most important and why the matter was not an affair for public eyes and ears. READ ALSO: 10 Major Facts From The Davido, Dele Momodu And Baby Mama Drama He wrote: “That’s why it is the child that is most important. I don’t like the way they have turned the young girl into a trophy to be fought over in a blood sport. We are in the age of the internet. Twenty years from today, someone could print out these funny details from the internet memory bank. A father, grandfather and a half-sister fighting a mother and her family over a baby and making sordid claims: It is not a fight that can be easily won.” Since late December, the Momodus have been in embroiled in a tug of war with the Adelekes over the custody of Sophie and Davido’s daughter, Imade. Davido, in several posts on social media, accused Sophie of being a bad mother and “infecting” her child with cannabis while Dele Momodu, the publisher of Ovation and Sophie’s cousin, has claimed, also via social media, that the Adelekes are trying to use their wealth to muscle a mother out of the life of her daughter.

   Never miss out! Woo hoo! Get the Magazine Get the magazine: Getty Images  Life & Style has exclusively learned that One Direction’s Louis Tomlinson is battling with his baby mama, Briana Jungwirth, over money — and more! “Louis didn’t buy her a house. He prepaid the rent for six months. And it isn’t in a luxury gated community or anything," a friend exclusively tells the mag. "It’s a standard, cookie-cutter home with a very small backyard and zero of the amenities Briana was expecting for her and her soon-to-be-born son.” RELATED: One Direction's Louis Tomlinson Breaks Up With Pregnant Girlfriend Briana Jungwirth  (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  (Photo Credit: Getty Images) Life & Style has also learned that Louis, 24, arranged to have IKEA furniture delivered to his former fling’s rental home, leaving nine months pregnant Briana struggling to assemble it herself. The friend tells the mag she had seen the pregnancy as her ticket to fame and fortune. “Briana feels she could rake in at least $58,000 a month,” the pal shares.

          More trouble for Wizkid as 2nd baby mama opens up

First it was a night club fight and now, it’s even something more controversial and messy. The father of one has tried so hard to distance himself from social media scandals, but recent events have shown that the pop star has been proved wrong. Earlier in the week, news broke that the pop star has another love child by a second baby mama, Binta Diamond Diallo who hails from Guinea, though Wizkid has not confirmed or denied the rumour about him having another child with his alleged baby mama, Binta Diamond Diallo. Sources close to Wizkid confirmed that his erstwhile girlfriend, Tania Omotayo, broke up with him recently, though both of them had a mutual understanding to remain civil and matured about the new development, all in a bid to avoid media scandals. Obviously, this is why she has kept her distance from the music star for some time now. She even boycotted most of wizkid’s events. One of such events was his Industry Nite. Tania was on vacation to Dubai with her friends. Could this have been possible if they were still love birds? It looks like Wizkid has been caught in a web spun with his own hands. The news of his second baby mama seems to ring true. According to reports, the alleged baby mama, Binta Diamond and Wizkid have been in a secret relationship for some time now. When she became pregnant they kept the relationship on a low key till she gave birth and shared the name of her son on her Instagram page. Surprisingly, she named the child after the star boy, – Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun – which is Wizkid’s exact first, middle and last names. Since the news broke out about Wizkid’s alleged second baby mama, the pop star has avoided the social media and has so far not officially confirmed or denied the rumour. Meanwhile, reports had it that Binta Diallo has made some new revelation regarding her new-born son. She was said to have explained why she intentionally named her son after the Afro-pop star, saying it was to avoid a repeat of the situation with Wizkid’s first baby mama- Oluwanishola Ogudugu. When Sola had the singer’s son in 2011, Wizkid repeatedly denied having any child until the evidence was too immense for him to run from. Binta, having learned from Sola’s experience, didn’t want to fall into such a media ordeal, and as such, chose to expose the fact that she had just given birth to Wizkid’s son. However, in a statement during the week, his management said, Wizkid hasn’t confirmed the news making the rounds that he has fathered another child. “Wizkid still hasn’t confirmed any news about him having another child. We know he is single and will be releasing his EP next month.” Wizkid alleged baby mama is said to be a Guinean model based in the United States. She has taken to her instagram page to release pictures of herself during pregnancy.” –

 TMZ Live: Paul McCartney: Music Legend REJECTED at Grammy After-Party Kanye West Shopping at Jacob & Co.  Chris Brown's baby mama claims the singer is not only a bad influence on their kid ... he's making the child sick.  Nia Guzman claims 1-year-old Royalty has developed asthma, and she says it's all because Chris has exposed her to an extreme amount of secondhand smoke. Brown is a weed and tobacco enthusiast. Nia says when Royalty comes back from a visit with Chris she usually reeks of smoke.  Guzman also claims in legal docs she's worried Chris is abusing drugs and has relapsed ... especially with sizzurp. Nia wants to restrict Chris' visitation ... asking the judge to force him to hire a full-time nanny or pull back on his right to be around the child.   She also wants the judge to force Chris to take random drug tests, prohibit him from using drugs or consuming alcohol around Royalty, and stop him from smoking around their daughter.  And Nia wants more child support ... she's getting $2,500 a month but wants it upped to nearly $16k a month. We've reached out to Chris' attorney for comment ... so far, no word back.  HERE'S THE RUNDOWN The Weeknd's Big Night Ended Face-to-Face with Police Kaley Cuoco May Have a New Man: Sam Hunt! Manny Pacquiao is in Hot Water over His Anti-Gay Comments Scott Disick: Heading to 'Dancing with the Stars"?  Looks like Kanye West has competition in the "shoes worth selling your soul for" department ... from Michael Jordan and Drake ... whose new collab shoe is the new flavor of the…  Chris Brown’s Daughter Has Asthma And His Baby Mama Says It’s All His Fault  It’s nice to see that things between World’s Best Dad…mug owner Chris Brown and the mother of his daughter, Nia Guzman, are still a mess as usual. It all started yesterday when Nia announced that their almost two-year-old daughter Royalty has asthma and accused Chris of being the reason why. According to Nia, Chris Brown loves weed and cigarettes more than their kid, and he’s constantly exposing her to second-hand smoke. Nia says Royalty usually comes home from Daddy’s house smelling like Mary-Kate Olsen’s wedding reception, and she wants a judge to force Chris Brown to hire a nanny to take care of Royalty. Of course, that’s not all Nia wants a judge to make happen. Nia also wants a judge to add a couple zeros to her monthly child support checks. Nia is currently getting $2500, but wants that changed to $16,000. This isn’t the first time Nia has come for Chris’ cash; back in July, Nia was trying to get $15,000 a month. Sadly, she was about as successful at getting money as Chris Brown is at not saying dumb shit, and that’s how she ended up at $2500 a month. Speaking of Chris Brown saying dumb shit. Shortly after Nia accused him of fucking up Royalty’s lungs with second-hand smoke, TMZ says that Chris released a statement of his own on Instagram, which has since been yanked down. Chris side-eyed Nia’s claims that Royalty got asthma from his smoking. Chris says he quit smoking cigarettes on New Years, and that no one smokes around his daughter. According to Chris, Nia is just trying to stuff more money into her bank account. “Well DUH” said Nia’s shameless $16,000 a month child support request. Chris says he stopped smoking cigarettes, but he failed to mention anything about not smoking weed. Although he doesn’t exactly have to. That busted Venus de Milo tattoo on his head is all the proof a judge needs that Chris Brown is in a committed long-term relationship with drugs. Regardless of whether or not Chris Brown is the reason Royalty has asthma, one thing is obvious; Nia needs to work on her get money game. You’ve got to keep it simple, Nia! Forget about the asthma story – I’m sure a judge would have accepted the following: “Your honor, my child is exposed to Chris Brown. Can I have more money please?” Pic: Wenn.com

Yessssssssssss finally 
 
Will this ever end. Too much already.Wild flowers!
 
Na wa o, who we go believe now?? I feel really bad for the innocent Imade. May God take control. 
 
What I most about all this is that everyone now knows that this little angle is suffering frm cannabis,what a shame to those the parents. #Abi#
 
Hmmm, na wa o
 
Dem don pay you in millions again abi? Blood money
 
Rubbish fabricated story. The so called davido an his baby mama are just a disgrace heavy  to humanity.I love the drama so that it will serve as a lesson to the shameless bitches out there.Another day remember to wear  condom or better ask sanusi he will tell you.#sad indeed

Davido,please go and rest.Your drama na last year own.DonJazzy and Baba Bariga own dey hot now.Dont you smoke Cannabis?Its probably 2nd hand smoke from you.Don't throw stones if you live in a glass house.I pray the Pwencess lives a long and fulfilling life,the fact she has immature people as parents shouldn't affect her in Jehovah's name.
 
Too long
 
Wow! Interesting exposé! But no side should be judged or defended now until Sophia releases her side of the story, but yall shud notice Sophia was with imade all through xmas holidays, so where is the kidnap accusation coming from? Interesting family
 
I have read and digested this article and come to conclusion that Davido made the First mistake by having unprotected sex with sophia.. Since the did has been done, no need to Lament or lash around.they should just call for a Family meeting to resolve this issue before it really gets out of hand.. Anyway#WhoshouldItell 
 
Have You Seen The FULL LIST Of Winners At The Headies? Check It Out
 
too long.....I am ourrahere.
 
U r just a child Davido, just a child
 
I thought this thing would have been forgotten, after the Olamide and Headies saga.
 
How is this an exclusive or the real story when if it's David Adeleke's narration? I tend to question your judgement at times
 
Some are not worth being called a mother. Except my oga
 
so who's at fault now ? Uggh  Sophia she's just taking advantage of this lil boy
 
Davido got niggas on deck typing for him! Same story all over again tho...Good luck yo! 
 
Hmmmm....timayas true story
 
Davido na only God fit save you o. Infected breast milk? O ma ga o
 
Enter your comment...Ghen ghen.......?waiting for uncle Dele own write up.......
 
The two family involved should go iron out their issues, stop making it public. Good luck

Lmao @ slap davido with the bill. Davido pele my dear you don use am rub her mouth so she got accustomed to it. Well written piece , all these you exhibits take them to court and prove your case if you want sole custody of your child. The fact that you still referring to him as uncle shows how well mannered you are! I trust myself if any uncle wanna act like agbaya , he gets disrespected ni o. *50 cent's baby mama
 
Phew! What a lengthy piece. And touching too.@Lindaikeji No. I FAN
 
This family member is jobless. Why are they forcing people to believe their lies. What can't rich people do. All in the bide to take the child from her mother. Same old gist. Just repeating the story wey we done hear before. They can easily manufacturer their own laboratory  result. And the date of that result sef! Now a result surface and Aunty Lynda na you them come give am to. Why not copy and send to NATIP. Abeg! The should be the child to its mother. Fake Ass people.

Poor baby..bad mother
 
Why put the medical record of the mother public.....very wrong! She could sue
 
Story
 
Absolute rubbish!!! Douch typo obviously was over zealous to write this childish horrid junk with so much typo.You and Sofia made ur bed... under the influence of something i take it. Now you both deal wuth it in private and stop airing out ur dirty laundry, ass, dick  and titties for us to see. Enough of this childish point scoring I say!!!
 
David jst keep being a gud dad 2 ur baby.God bless u
 
Yup, Davido wrote this. The English is TRAGIC!! This proves that even with a million dollar education, a blockhead is a blockhead
 
Story for the gods. Adeleke's are Known 4 this. Using money to cover a lot of shits
 
Yup, Davido wrote this. The English is TRAGIC!! This proves that even with a million dollar education, a blockhead is a blockhead
 
Nawaaa oooo girls won't just have sense fa.... you have no education, no career, no job and you have a baby with the father footing all ur bills...still you are useless fa....just receive sense should be ur resolution this year.
 
This is getting serious, too much dirty secrets are been expose
 
This boy who says nothing without mentioning his age should be told to keep quiet and push his family business somewhere....you never loved her, you slept with her countless times and even took her in....rubbish talk.Nobody wants to hear
 
Linda how is this exclusive Biko? It came from Davido(one sided ), no blame on him, just his baby mama!...I think it's only a 3rd party in the circle that can have the real exclusive gist.
 
Irrespective of your stories,you must accept and rise to the challenges of fatherhood 
 
OMG!
 
Useless Dele momodu 
 
It was a long one, but I had to read it. I was discussing this with my friend that she is looking for attention because they are not giving her funds or somethng. May God help u guys sort it. Petition my foot looool this is the real petition, its just not addressed. Loool. Plus prove sef. 
 
I've been waiting for the Adelekes family to tell the real story. Mr Famzer dele momodu go and hide your head in shame 
 
na their matter oooJst pasiingThen i saw this And end up commenting
 
Don't pay any money to that Whore ooo ! Just take ur Baby n let her be ...besides she's old enough to take care of her self
 
What an epistle!!!
 
Dele momodu is a big Goat 
 
na their matter oooJst pasiingThen i saw this And end up commenting
 
Ok noted 
 
Everything makes sense now. Sophie n her family are just bunch of schemers 
 
Quite sad! I really pity Davido. But this is a lesson to all young people, tread with caution coz you never know who has a major plan to ruin you just because you have been so blessed
 
The story too long abeg
 
Mr Davido. I patiently read you letter. I can very well say this. You are not innocent in this matter. You yourself have lived and still live a frivolous lifestyle. You also have smoked Cannabis(Igbo). I know you are not an ideal role model for the Nigerian Youth. No one forced or tricked you into having sexual intercourse with Sophia . The result is Imade. I do not dispute all you have said.. I believe most of it are true. I personally believe Sophia  might be a gold digger. However, you cant sit on this pedestal of being a victim. You are a perpetrator too. My advice for you is to give you life to Christ and change your ways. As regards what Mr Dele Momodu did, I see nothing wrong. Especially in stoping you from flying out of the country with a baby without the mother or the mother's consent. He was wrong to post your dirty linen on social media, he wasnt wrong for stopping you at the airport.Whether you like it or not, you are forever tied to Sophia  by Imade. As long as she is alive (May she live long In Jesus Name) you will be tied to Sophia . You cant separate a child from her mother no matter your reasons. So stop all this posting on social media and writing letters, we dont need your explanations. Do what is right in the sight of God and Man and keep your matters private.God Bless You All.
 
I'm lost.. Sophia.. Uncle dele.. David..please u all should find a civil way to fix this.. Please for d sake of little imade
 
Now, it all makes sense. Sophia is a slimy character. So she was actually with her child up till Dec 28th and decided to raise false alarm to her Uncle cos of Dubai trip. To think that she denied the cannabis story earlier. See evidence before our very eyes. Moral of the story: Men please zip up before you enter one chance.
 
Hmmmm, shopia is not a good mother. God help you davido and imade. 
 
Enter your comment...Only time will tell when d real truth will manifest#Haveyouprayedfornigeriatoday
 
Three sides to a storyYours, Mine and the Truth.ALHAJI_NATTY
 
Why is dis post filled with too much bullshit,David u should just get a life and stop been childish,u ve been gutted just accept and pay your fucking bills OBO.... It's best u seek advise from 2face#needanalibitojoinmetastethenewgeishasardine 
 
Long stuff
 
Wow! This is worth taking the child away from the mum.
 
I read every bit of this.. Don't even know what to type .Lord heal these people.
 
My advice for davido, let Sophia have imade then sit back and watch. Your daughter will come back to you! 
 
We have heard all this before you guys should please keep your problems to yourselves...The public will never solve the problems for you instead people will laugh and make mockery of your family....That's my take......Linda am back.....Much Love/Long Live LIB
 
Linda I have been following your blog way back from Nigeria. .. but I must confess Davido is really sick and needed urgent attention. .. why all these stories? ???? Also there is never a fire without smoke,if you have display some level of maturity and responsibility, all these wouldn't have happened. Also tou need to shut your trash by bragging about who your family is an what you guys have cos you wanna know, we don't care. The issue is about you being irresponsible and your family supporting you not to be... treat the issues and not personality. ..hence stop blaming the momodu's for your incompetence and failure as a father. .. well I hope you find favor in the eyes of the lord... sha keep your family dirty linen out of this precious blog.... for the last time,  do your responsibility as a father and stop blaming people for your failure. .. you were not forced when you were having unprotected sex...
 
Very gd... waitin for d silly sophia post her own side of d story if she's bold enof....

God will punish Dele Momodu, Sophie and the entire Momodus....Lowlifes.Do we have a children welfare system in Nigeria???? Can we please fight together to ensure that Imade is handed over to the Adeleke's where she will given the best medical treatment and a deserving future??Yes, a child should only stay with a sane and morally upright mother, not a weed-puffing, cannabis-smoking, night-crawling mother.
 
Lol....
 
Hmmm
 
Poor Little Angel Imade ; I pray God Give her a Sound Good Health ; Get Well Soon Dear !!! All Iz Well!!!Davido I took time to read This and I understand how U feel ; I learn a lot from your experincn. I Pray God Give More Wisdom To handle it all to the End . The Biggest Mistake a Man could Make in Life is to Marry the Wrong Woman or have a Bad woman as a Babi mama ; They tend to kill ones Dream , they selfish and self centered . David Adelake I Pray God Almighty see u through all This . All Your Hard Labor towards your Lovly Daughter will not be in Vain All Iz Well . *DEW*

It's a sad story but the issue remains that if you don't like a person why sleep with them? Why give people you don't want in your life a free pass into it. Let's be more careful with how we deal with people and people we deal with
 
Linda, in order to balance your report on this whole childish drama I'll advice and suggest you also get an "exclusive response" from Sophia the baby mama and mother of Imade.. Don't rely on a one-sided story or response. There is always more to any story. From experience in life I've learnt that there's always 3 sides to every story. In this case, Davido's side, Sophia's side and the truth. Don't believe one side hook, line and sinker. 
 
Oh! Can't believe I read dat! Think I love Davido now...
 
Oh!I took my precious time to read dis touching story and I pray dat aall dis dat happened does not affect Davido negatively.Its so obvious dat d lady is really cashing on d baby to suck Davido dry despite her irresponsible act. Wht a shame!In fact Davido I really respect u and apr8 ur coming out to dish dis truth and exposing those black souls such as Dele Momodu dat hav lost his value and true sense.Biko keep ur child away frm her and she doesn't deserve ur dime bcos u don't owe her any tin.   Kai! But some ladies r so foolish and senseless mostly dis Sophia of a girl. She is indeed a real liability dat should b lay off and kept distance away frm.End of story!
 
Enter your comment...wow,  that is alot to take in at once 
 
Money miss road people, just by dint and stroke of luck, fortunate lucky assholes think Nigeria belongs to them..... your Dr. father or Uncle has no globally acclaimed  research paper published on the net, yet he`s a doctor of what ?  Singing trash & calling it music, "Omo Baba Olowo"..... Music for me is Ebeneezer Obey, Anikulapo Kuti, Sunny Ade, & Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister. We know your grand parents humble beginnings from Ile-Ife, to Ibadan. Were the Adventists   Americans who`d helped shipped your fathers to the US in the early 80`s were like you people, there won`t be any Davido-Omo Baba Olowo today.The Adeleke`s should learn to be humble, we know those who came from wealthy backgrounds in the 50`s and 60`s in Nigeria, and their children and grand children never flaunt it..... Davido is trash ! 
 
Davido, at 21 you are not naive, you should have used a condom
 
Let's be careful of the type of people we deal with. 
 
Aww poor little innocent child...get well soon honeyStory too long, I was almost dozing off...

Abeg abeg make we hear word !!you and all the hkn gang smoked all day ,everyday when she was around you ,so you are as guilty !! Maybe Na thru ur genes sef n infected sperm tht the poor child got from ;!!mcheeww
 
Davido u r nt d first baby daddy,why cnt dey live you alone.they simply want money n recognition.
 
Well they should settle this issue amicably, enough of this drama 
 
Wow such an innocent baby already suffering at a tender age.  
 
I don't believe all dis crappy lies! What a fabricated story. Well i guess d writer wud be all smiles right now bcos he/she might have  receive huge compensation for this. GOD HELP US.
 
Long story. Davido should also be held liable you can't blame one person in a game meant for two
 
I'm not interested in this bs story go and settle your ish with your babymother. You made your bed so ly in it. Next time use a CONDOM
 
nawaooo!   sophie u r Really a disgrace to motherhood.  but davido u still young for this drama o. settle it out.#kpomkwem#
 
Hmmmmm long buh I read it all...David u hv tried jawe...
 
Hmmmm.....speechless.
 
I just hope all this stops in no time cos this lil baby doesn't need all the negative energy surrounding her ATM. It's just a pity all this is happening. Buh I thought there's something called maternal instincts, how did Miss Sophia not know Cannabis is bad for her baby's health? I mean "pepper lovers" reduce pepper intake cos of breastfeeding let alone hard drugs? Secondly, if all this buying a ticket thing is this serious, why didn't she get herself a ticket from her Dec "allawee"? Well, since this has started in the media, it'd still end here so Linda I'm waiting for more gists.Ivy
 
Dude indeed if na u write this, you need to shut the heck up and think about your role in this. I bet you did not think the girl an worthless POS before you slept with her. Nigg just take care of your biz and stop blabbing shieZe
 
God help this child oh! I knew all along that this girl wanted to milk Davido dry.
 
Linda oohhh this is too long
 
They wan put you on Linda... well, this is quite narrative.. some uncles tho
 
make i hear say i read am
 
my goodness, this is horrible. Davido is too young for all these bullshit. this girl is a very dumb lazy old fool. I'm a mother and I can't bear to see my kids in pain. 
 
Davido sure u are a true fada...Sophia is just like her mum..hmmmmm I reserved my comment..
 
Oh no, I pity this little girl. What future await her with all these negative publicity. Is she safe with the father? 
 
Enter your comment...this is really stories that touch like falz album. #Godblessyoudavid
 
What else, d whole truth has been told. May God help us.
 
This is so so sad! That a young boy of 23 is being manipulated because of his love for his daughter? Haba! Shame on you Mr. Momodu, shaaaaame! So many boys of David's age will run away from such responsibility if if it's proven they fathered the child but David accepted his daughter and has loved her before our own eyes! If y'all want to extort him for this reason, then for real you have shown that you are an Agbaya Mr. Momodu. Once again shame on you! If David were my son or brother, I will insist he leaves Imade for the Momodu's to bring her up, posterity will prove he loved her, it is on the Internet for her to see, if uncle dele does not help Sophie to bring her up well, Sophie will answer to Imade in future. A father, at his young age is trying to give his best to his daughter and one useless uncle is trying to cause chaos in her life. David though I know you can't watch your child suffer or risk losing her but I for say leave Imade for them for a few years make Sophia eyes clear! Rubbish! I dry vex, nobody messes with Davido not when he had fans who will take a bullet for him! Craze ppl. Let's leave trash for Lawma!
 
I pray imade gets well soon. I am not to judge. only God knows d truth. get well soon sweet imade
 
All this stupid Lagos fake big girls and their rubbish life style..the in thing now is to get pregnant for a famous musician so they can fuel their useless lifestyle 
 
O boy d story long..but we still finish am sha..#libnation
 
Na wa oooo
 
Tears Tears.... For the poor Imade. It is well with the Adelekes
 
Mehn dis is 2 long..Davido d lord Will b ur strength...
 
Davido leave that man. It's painful but what can you do? Just keep calm.21 years os not "just" joor.Fear nor catch u sef when you dey sleep with ur obviously older baby mama?
 
PARENTAL ADVISORY^^^Adult Content^^^So I shud read DAT long epistle, becos David said I should....Rubbish
 
Chai this baby don suffer! If the baby needs medical care,then by all means give it to her,even if u hv to pay sophia's plane ticket to tag along! 
 
I really see the truth in the whole drama..its apparent that Davido and his family are best suited to cater for the child...
 
This girl is crazy!, to say the least....1 Million???. Who does she think she is?, what's her workand is she not even ashamed. This is a situation that happens in different levels and spheres of life, in Nigeria.... Women and lies. Mr Davido, if you need one more lawyer on your side, and army will rise for.... This is 'blatant' extortion.... Mr 'momodu' ur own dey ur body.... U should grow up man. Ur niece or cousin, whatever she is, is proud and foolish and shebshould get a life... All that's played out so far shows her irresponsibility and I'm gonna follow this ish to the end... Its now a personal beef for me @ d momodus....u can't do that to the young man... U want to suck his family dry?, obviously hez gat dough and so what?... What was she thinking whenbshe was getting pregnant for a younger person...well so what ? Is it davidos fault?... How aboutbthe young girl here who matters??, the young beautiful daughter and all u care about is a trip to Dubai.... What the momodu family doesn't realize.... If the child dies u all loose, if the child gets depressed and has a messed up childhood, you all loose. How many kids does tu baba have from how many women, how many of them is showing themselves.... Or d beef is DAT davido nor wan marry u????. Get a life girl... Get a life. This is childish.... Well for the record, Annie idibia has done well for herself and Linda please publish my comment cause I'm d new biggest davido right hand man... I've seen this kinda situation before ..... Among very average nigerians , talk much less of those who should be on the high class ranking..  Dis is naija.... If you don't want to work hard and survive.. Den go and... , even the woman that Osho baba told to go and die was working and hussling on the streets of Benin. If u got a case(@her), I didn't bothr to note ur name, u made this public ...  Well justify to Nigerian ....where majority of us are on the poverty line what u need 1 m. A month for , even if its 300 thousand sef,Which school did u finish from, what's ur work...... Gosh...can u imagine
 
What a piece! Let conscience guide all of you in this quagmire or should I say fracas. For the sake of peace bury your hatchets. Please do not compromise the peaceful and lovely growth of this innocent child. Mr. Momodu kindly sheath the two edged VERY BLUNT sword you are brandishing before the Adelekes because it will not even cut the thinnest of skin when struck.
 
Wow I really had to comment on dis Davido u tried buh u meet 2baba 4 advice nw nt tym learn to use a condom 
 
Davido SUE the hell out of dele momodu and his family, stop paying that crazy ass gurl 300k, reduce that shit to 150k a month or 100 self, what the fuck is she doing with that cash. Put her on a written down budget....u hv a clear case here...no mother shud be on any medication or even drug wen breastfeeding
 
Fucking hell this people are mad for attention all his aim is to over shadow that olamides headies ish.....this people just fucking childish I don't rate them all anyway....never wasted my money to go watch some fucking show before....even is they walk past me would never even ask for a picture

Hai Linda this story di mbehuge
 
Make all of take a chill pill
 
hmmmmmmm.....short of words Sisi linda
 
So it's true .nawa o
 
Make all of them take a chill pill 
 
guy I feel ur pains but the mistake has been done just learn form it and retrace your foot step..Imade will get will soonEmjay
 
This is serious. I said it before this Sophia isn't straight in her ways. Too much dreaming, she want to be a BIG GIRL. 
 
If this davido story is true then davido don enter one chance be that.Every man wit his own cross.Na ur own cross be this and only God can deliver.
 
hmmmm. interesting. #lindaitsurboy 
 
how come you are planned a trip with a 7month old without the mother? am waiting for the mother's side of the story 
 
This is a serious matter!
 
Hmmm. Jez pity the little baby and let this rest please. #lobatan!!!
 
This is a serious matter!
 
This is the drama that comes with baby mama.Just take good care of Imade n sort ur issues later.#Hajia Mufliat
 
Hmmm,it is well
 
Its well ooo,am just pitying Imade in all this, d baby must be stressed out from all d tension around her
 
hmmm.... this is serious!
 
congrat ur baby is so cute...Plz invite me to d child dedication I love dat part 
 
Hmmmm na wah ooo who do I believe now?
 
When two people fight d 3rd is to make peace, davido might have done something wrong but dele momodu who is older did more damage but God know d best
 
Hmmm,it is well
 
Wise Child! Well written! Dele Momodu has always looked mean and is mean! Fat frog!Ride on Davido, God has blessed not man can curse, it's only a pity you fell into the wrong hand, wrong girl, wrong in laws! Nice people always meet not-nice people!
 
Hmmm, a detailed one indeed, God will help you through. 
 
Wow. Just wow! I feel sorry for Davido and the innocent baby. 
 
I read only small too long to read! Davido sorry keep calm 
 
Feeling u David.   At least ur daughter will grow up to know u tried ur best. People can be sooo heartless and self centered
 
This is so sad. I feel for Davido. It is obvious Sophia is a gold digger, but unfortunately she misfired. She shld ve gotten pregnant for someone older, like Dbanj or Don Jazzy or Banky. 1m a month plus Benz SUV? Thunder fire u. Stupid ashewo. Nigerian stars shld take this as a wake up call bc there hundreds of Sophia's out there waiting to get pregnant 4 u. They ve learnt it from black Americans, so beware.
 
First we need to hear Sophia's side of the story so that she can explain how her child developed the lungs conditions and why she has stopped breast feeling, otherwise she is just a gold digger who is only interested in her own selfish gain not considering the health of her Baby  !

Davido ozuola,leave dem to God.. He will must be done,not any man's will.. Sorry my Davido
 
I feel u David. At least ur daughter will grow up to know u tried ur best. People can be sooo heartless 
 
Thats how Most family in Nigeria act... D reject u to strugle and when the realise ur succeeding... D now claime d know u and can stand in for u... 
 
Whatever!Take all this to court, the court of law and not public opinion!!! Foolishness all around. This child will grow up and hate both parents at this rate. Nonsense!! when you were creating her no love letter was broadcast to the world.hiss. If the poor child is infected then both parents are to blame. Davido is everywhere smoking all kinds of nonsense with his group, that's another way for a child toinhale 2nd hand smoke. Pls pls pls, it is  a new year. Recieve sense in Jesus name!!!
 
Na wa o!!!
 
Sophie!!!!!! If all these is true then you must really be out of your mind. Who are your friends? Who is your advisor? What is your mum not doing wright? Haaaa I'm ashamed of you,  you better change your ways and become a better person because right now you are a complete disgrace to women and human race in general. Abi iru katikati wo leleyi?

Is well...
 
Mr Mamoodu You should apologise to the adelekes  and try to help your so called cousin into rehab. Obviously she gas no parental figures in her life and this is where u and your wife should have stepped in; instead of going to the Internet to raise dust.  Grow up  Dele;  u can still make amends for the innocent child's sake!
 
Jesus! So she actually tested positive to cannabis??? A breastfeeding mum??? I tot it was all made up. Well,David,u ve tried. Al it of mature men sef won't take responsibility of their love child,but u stood up  for ur daughter. Leave Sophia to take her child and lets see how far she goes since all these was because she didn't go to Dubai.  
 
hmmmm. Davidо sounds truthful especially with the medical reports and pics.
 
May God give u the grace to completely ignore your detractors and remain focus.... No one would have come calling if u were a shoe shiner..
 
Hhhhmmm, this is serious wo. I pray u settle ur difference 4 d sake of d baby. 
 
I doff my cap for the English graduate student that was hired to write this epistle.Hungry writers please continue to camp at this boy's gate. This kind of grammar has never escaped his mouth in life -"offing" indeed!!! lwkmd. 
 
The second picture brought tears to my eyes. The poor baby...
 
Chai! Can't read this oo...infact am in church#lindaThumbsUp 
 
Speechless, 
 
Hmmm am so proud of you little daddy davido,here comes a small boy wanting to be responsible and d older ones want to spoil his name,please don't give up ur reward is in heaven and to Sophia just be grateful to God for d angel he sent to u, my ex close to four year has paid fees and even sent me one naira to feed his kids yet u allow people use ur dump head not to give ur baby d best hmmm if I were u I will go and kneel down and beg d family and get a life,humble ur self and see if d guy will consider u,because u have more to gain and noting to loose why go to club 'give u sweet girl that God gave u d best, instead use d money for clubs rather enroll for a professional handwork girl,ur name shld not be in d papers in such a bad manner,and don't depend on any man! Cannibabis positive Shame really!but please davido please for d sake of that beautiful child imade please help d mother enrol her to go further in her studies,please and for oga dele why now enh don't complicate issues for d girl adjsut her life either:seriously am still in shock how such a young boy will be so responsible like this may God bless u davido and family for ur daddy davido na better person may u leave long daddy kai u try,God bless ur sister for help out and linda keep d fire burning pretty you God bless u all
 
Well, well, well... it is well. but ds results ain't dat of Imade Adeleke. It's of Sophie Momodu
 
If davido wrote this himself his dad didn't waste money on his education if not kudos to the person who wrote it. 
 
Oh WOW! just WOW
 
oh my!!!  i dont just know what to say.  God please guide and protect baby Imade. 
 
Eeyah! Too too bad. Davido mabinu, may God keep u and ur daughter 
 
In all, i'd still blame  Davido for allowing all of these at d first place. And secondly, i'll forever fault a scenario whereby an older lady sleeps with a man much younger than she is for any reason whatsoever, where's d sense in that? U guys should settle amicably pls coz you're both very irresponsible.....
 
Wow! Am   speechless! I just praay dat. God gives d. Lil princess gooddd health!  
 
somepeople wound easily blame davido because he is a celeb and from a wealthy home but i have a deep feeling here that davido is telling the truth and the davido i no....to have maintained his cool just because of the love for imade and even the way the car issue kept repeating itself from solphia and dele momodu self publication online vindicated davido afterraw and placing material things over your own child and that to me is LACK OF CARE because as the mother you can change overnite to a saint so as to weep public sentiment and davido you are a man and never wasnt a true fan  but from this moment i am your true fan 
 
Usless girl unless momodu...davido much love to u and your daughterThis is what cossy should be doing...donating her milk...~Make I go drink one bottle of beer~
 
Dis story sud jst die abeg.am tired of hearing dis noise from dis family nd also dis am jst 21 or 23.at 19 I already know my right nd wrong so biko it's ok
 
Eeyah! Too too bad. Davido mabinu, may God keep you and ur daughter 
 
Slow to judge.
 
The whole attention has been on olamide and don jazzy ,this punk will do anything to be on the news including using his poor child .Useless fellow .

Clayanna Warthen was with Andre for 6 years and feels that she is now entitled to $58,000 per month because Andre is now making about $11 million a year in the NBA.

The blonde beauty, who briefly dated baby daddy Louis Tomlinson in 2015, welcomed son Freddie Reign on January 21. Apart from one picture at the hospital, Briana hasn't posted any pictures of the tot since he first showed his face.

The One Direction member’s former flame Briana Jungwirth shared a photo of her growing baby bump and we gotta say, not only does she look stunning, she looks ready to pop! The photo of the soon-to-be mom was posted on an unconfirmed Instagram, but it certainly appears to be Jungwirth. One Directioners have been blowing up the account debating the validity of the photo. We’ll just let you decide if this photo is legit. beyond grateful for such a beautiful day A photo posted by Briana Jungwirth (@brianaashleyjungwirth) on Dec 25, 2015 at 9:14pm PST In other Louis-related news, it appears he shelled out a pretty penny so his rumored current girlfriend, Danielle Campbell, could fly her beloved pooch Max from London to Chicago in a private jet. Campbell was reportedly concerned Max might get sick in the Alps. Louis apparently flew Danielle’s dog, Max, back to the states in its own private jet #VideoMTV2015 One Direction pic.twitter.com/8yDUmsySnH — Till The END❤️ (@1DUpDaates__) January 5, 2016  Say what you want about Louis, but he is a generous fellow. He has “Dad Material” written all over him!

The R&B singer and his new girlfriend Daphne Joy were spotted showing some PDA at the LAX yesterday. Derulo and Joy have been linked for months now but the singer denied the reports in the past. TMZ posted a video of the two hugging each other tight as they make their way through LAX. The pair were returning from a vacation in Miami together. Back in November Daphne Joy vigorously denied that she is dating the singer. Perhaps she has had a change of heart since then.  50 Cent has since responded via Instagram to Derulo banging his baby mama. “But don’t worry baby, I’m fine just a little shook up.

												 Married drug lord “El Chapo” might have the hots for sultry star Kate del Castillo — but he apparently spent New Year’s Eve with a 26-year-old politician with whom he has a child, according to a report. Joaquin Guzman spent Christmas with his wife, American-born stunner Emma Coronel, in Mocorito before spending New Year’s Eve with Lucero Guadalupe Sanchez, a member of the Sinaloa Congress, in Guamuchil, Central European News reports. Sanchez also visited the Mexican coke kingpin in the Altiplano slammer in May when she was pregnant, according to the report. Prison officials had complained to the attorney general that El Chapo was visited by a woman who used a fake ID. Sanchez has denied being the woman seen on surveillance video. The newspaper Excelsior reported last year that Sanchez first met El Chapo during a 2013 party. A few months later, her former husband and the father of her two sons, Ruben Chavez, 27, was fatally shot. One of the diminutive drug lord’s attorneys confirmed in a statement leaked by the attorney general’s office in Mexico shortly after his second escape from a high-security prison that Sanchez visited El Chapo to discuss where and how their kid would be raised. Del Castillo won El Chapo’s trust — and heart — and set up the controversial interview with Sean Penn that ultimately led to his Jan. 8 capture.

Daily Trust (Abuja)
 Lagos — Controversies between the popular hip hop act David Adeleke, popularly known as "Davido", and his estranged baby mother, Sophia Momodu over alleged trafficking of their seven-month-old baby, Imade Adeleke, get messier on Tuesday as Davido releases to public domain, alleged medical report confirming that Sophia is a chain smoker of cannabis. It would be recalled that Sophia had challenged the popular artiste and his family to publish the medical report claiming she has cannabis in her blood to prove the allegation of taking her baby away from her custody. But in a series of counter messages on his instagram on Tuesday, Davido narrated how Sophia allegedly "trapped" her with the pregnancy when it is in its second trimester of Sophia's pregnancy was closing. He said the baby was in Sophia's custody for two months until she got severely sick and Adeleke's family had to intervene. "Imade was in her custody for 2 straight months, unchallenged and uninterrupted, until the baby took badly and severely ill in July. Imade cried, ceaselessly, for 48 hours. She was rushed to the hospital where her condition confounded medical experts. Several tests were conducted on her and later on the mother. "Medical reports, herein attached (exhibit 1), proved that Sophia's blood was polluted to the maximum level with cannabis and she had by the process of breast feeding infected her child with complicated medical conditions associated with the use of alcohol and especially cannabis. The trouble spot for made was her lungs. She had difficulty breathing largely because of the contaminated breast milk and the severity of the "Second Smoke" of marijuana inhaled by the poor child. "The medical experts at the hospital were enraged by the callous treatment of Imade by her own mother and declared her unfit for the caring and the nursing of a delicate baby. The team determined that they would hand over the baby to the Children's Welfare Authority of Lagos State Government. Alleged medical report My family started to plead with the hospital management. For the first time, Sophia too was sober, sorry and contrite. We pleaded that the baby would be kept from the mother once she was returned to us, and that we would take over responsibilities for Imade's welfare," Davido writes. However, Sophia's uncle who is also the publisher of Ovation Magazine, Dele Momodu in messages on his instagram condemned the alleged medical report, saying it was "an attack on a defenseless lady who merely asked that she be allowed to enjoy the fruit of motherhood". "Even a Laboratory result alleging she's a cannabis smoker was splashed everywhere. She was said to have infected her own baby with cannabis. The vicious authors expected some gullible people to believe them. Nothing could have been cruelest. Our initial reaction was to maintain the ceasefire but this latest attack against a defenseless lady who merely asked that she be allowed to enjoy the fruit of motherhood was the limit of recklessness and rascality," Momodu Copyright © 2016 Daily Trust.

The Love and Hip Hop Hollywood reality star took to Twitter on Wednesday, the same day that he did an interviewer claiming that she purposely got pregnant with his baby. Since the news broke last month of the unplanned pregnancy, the feud between the two celebrities have been heating up.  During an interview with TheShadeRoom on Wednesday, Fetty Wap opened up about how he and Masika met and also states that she purposely got knocked up. That part of the interview started around the 2:30 minute mark  Seems Masika Kalysha didn’t take his statement too likely and went on a Twitter rant. She is basically saying that he was the one who purposely got her pregnant. “That b**ch was better of keeping his mouth shut. No real man speaks negative about the woman he got pregnant on purpose against her will,” she tweeted.  Men lie, women lie but these text messages don't lie ?

She knew for sure he was not wearing any protection and didn’t seem to have a problem with him not protecting him self. She acted as if she very much welcome his carelessness. So i would say he right. Not the she know I wasn’t wearing protection, so I had to put it somewhere defense. Let’s see how “right” he is when she takes him to court for child support.

 The Nigerian entertainment industry is looking set to have a magical year in respect to celebrity dramas and the media buzz in the wake of this. It remains to be seen where this leads us to in 2016.  Davido and baby Imade Credit: Instagram From the face-off between Freeze and Basketmouth in late December, 2015 to Olamide and Don Jazzy at the Headies which held on January 1, 2016, the fans and critics are sure having a swell time going back and forth with claims and counterclaims. It has been interesting so far. READ ALSO: Aftermath Of The Olamide And Don Jazzy ‘Beef’ But in spite of all that has happened recently with celebrities and the dramas revolving around them, nothing has been quite as big and as lasting as the current scuffle between Davido, Sophia Momodu (his ‘baby mama’) and her uncle Dele Momodu. And as we wake up to newer revelations with each passing day, below are 10 lessons we can draw so far from the ensuing drama: 1. Davido was unhappy about Sophia’s pregnancy as he clearly didn’t expect a child with her – According to him, on learning that Sophie was pregnant for him, his mind was bemused and his soul confused. He however said he accepted his responsibility for the sad misadventure that put him on a flight with her, a flight headed nowhere. 2. There is no love lost between Davido Adeleke and Dele Momodu – Dele Momodu has come out to say Sophie was ‘comprehensively scandalized’. In a statement released on January 4, the Ovation publisher said details circulating in the media of his cousin being a cannabis smoker is so bad ‘nothing could have been cruelest’. 3. Baby Imade was allegedly ‘forcefully’ taken away from her mum on July 11, 2015 – Contrary to claims that baby Imade was to be taken abroad for treatment, Mr. Momodu says this has been an unwarranted fabrication of endless lies to justify the act of forcefully taking a baby from her biological mother. Momodu claims the baby had been ‘forcefully separated’ from her mother at only two months old, and there were pleas for months for her to be returned to her biological mother but all Sophia got was the opportunity to visit her daughter once a week, specifically on Sundays. 4. Claims that Imade was unwell might be untrue – This is because when Imade was taken abroad for alleged treatments, she had in fact being with her aunt, Ashley Adeleke (Davido’s sister), in Dubai as they were both swimming in the pool of Atlantis, The Palm Dubai, a luxury resort. Ashley Adeleke abd baby Imade in Dubai. Credit: Instagram 5. Sophia Momodu might not be the defenseless, poor mother after all – Contrary to Mr. Momodu’s report that Sophia was a defenseless lady who had been unfairly treated; there are revelations that she is a party lover and a lavish spender who contributes nothing to vast expenses incurred. In addition, no one from her family, including her uncle Dele Momodu, contributed even a coin to the expenses at the time. Davido claims the entire burden of medical bills, feeding, transportation and sundry expenses were handled by him. 6. There might be more to this from the Momodu family than we know – There are possibilities there is more to the relationship within the Momodu family than we currently know or read about. Davido claims while things were rosy between him and Sophia, she revealed some details to him about her uncle Dele Momodu that he doesn’t want to divulge. 7. Sophia Momodu might have employed ‘diabolical’ means along the line – Davido claims he opened his doors to Sophia even when he was uncertain it was his baby she was carrying. It was after May 14, 2015 when the baby had been born that DNA results confirmed his status as father. Also, according to him she was a drifter without a relative to assist her in Lagos which led her to moving in with the Afro pop star. He alleged she took advantage of his poor judgment, using a cunning sense and vicious diabolical support to try and make him a victim. 8. The Momodu family might have been jealous all along – Reports from Davido’s camp allege Mr. and Mrs. Momodu are showing a fake love towards Sophia especially because she had a baby for a fairly prominent family. He also claims they are jealous of the fact that she ever became a mum and do not wish the little baby the best things. 9. Mr and Mrs Momodu are crowding Davido’s space – The singer alleged this because upon first meeting Sophia and all through when they were together, she never formally introduced any of them to him which makes him wonder why an absentee uncle has any traction on the moral authority commanding the affairs as it is. READ ALSO: Dele Momodu Is Not Being Truthful, If Anything Happens To My Daughter He Is Responsible – Davido 10. Sophia Momodu was never reportedly unprepared for motherhood – The singer claimed to have provided her a monthly allowance of N300, 000 in addition to utility bills. He also fully paid a two-year rent for her apartment but she left the house in no time in search of the glitzy night life in Lagos, leaving her baby behind.  Naij.com Home Page Think it is important?

Nia Guzman is reportedly furious with Chris Brown and filed legal documents to restrict the singer's visitation with their daughter, Royalty. Guzman's frustrations reportedly stem from Brown's alleged smoking around the 1-year-old child. TMZ reports that Guzman has asked a judge to order the "Liquor" singer to submit to random drug testing and prohibit him from smoking or drinking alcohol when he's with their daughter. Guzman claims that the infant has developed asthma, and she believes it's because Brown allegedly smokes weed and cigarettes when Royalty is with him. She also fears that Brown has relapsed and started doing "sizzurp," a concoction made with cough syrup and used as a recreational drug, again. According to the outlet, Guzman also says that whenever Royalty returns from visiting the 26-year-old pop star, her clothes smell like smoke. She wants the judge to either make Brown hire a full-time nanny or wants the singer to have less time with his daughter. In addition, Guzman also wants $16,000 a month in child support. Brown currently gives her $2,500. According to The Shade Room, Brown responded to Guzman’s claims on Instagram, writing that he and his friends have never smoked around his daughter. “This is obviously a play to get some sort of increased income,” Brown wrote in a since-deleted post. “I take care of my daughter, and I would never ever put her in a position that will harm her. I’m so sick and tired of negative people trying to use me and slander me … My daughter is my pride and joy, and I will not be played because my lifestyle is different from the other parities [sic] involved. This really has to stop.” The "Loyal" singer also posted a cryptic message about the struggles of being an adult. A photo posted by @chrisbrownofficial on Jan 30, 2016 at 6:36pm PST   In December, Brown dished on co-parenting and raising his daughter, telling "On Air With Ryan Seacrest" that he wanted to give up smoking because of Royalty. “One habit I’m quitting for the New Year’s resolution is definitely smoking cigarettes,” he said. “For my daughter to be a light in the my life, I think this is something I need to get rid of.”  Brown and Guzman spent the beginning of last year battling each other in court over their custody arrangement. The pair finally agreed to co-parent and share custody in October 2015. The IBT Pulse Newsletter keeps you connected to the biggest stories unfolding in the global economy.
