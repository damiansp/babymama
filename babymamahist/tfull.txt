Anderson Coats (aka nilliaj) A Good Mom by Elizabeth Cunningham-Halbert When I was Garbage by Allison Crews Reclaiming my sexuality by Ella Legal Emergency? A Guide to Fast Action Community Advocacy and Support by and for Young Mothers  I just recently had my baby (a beautiful 8 lb boy named Indigo) and for the most part things have been going well. The only thing I've been struggling with is this sense that I don't really know who I am anymore.  I don't have time for myself or to do any of the things that excited me before, and in all of that I've kind of lost touch with myself.  Less than two years ago I didn't care about anyone--I was a single girl heading off to college and just wanted to have a little fun.   But I fell in love and made a baby.  And here I am, a full time mom and wife-to-be.  I haven't even had a chance to catch my breath.  I think about my identity, the traits that describe me, and I'm not even sure any of that applies to me anymore.  I'm not the same person I was two years ago.  And I don't have any time to figure out who am I now.   Sometimes I feel like I've been erased.  Like I'm kind of a shell of my former self.  and really, it's a little alarming. So to mothers out there....I know it gets better as your baby gets older and more independent, but in the mean time...how did you get through those first few months?  how did you maintain sanity?  has anyone else experienced this sense of having lost themselves? i guess i kinda went through that too for a little bit.  you can still be yourself and be a mom!  i didn't let me from having a child at a young age stop me from doing what i want to do or being who i want to be!  of course, i don't go out as much, but more then likely i would rather just sit at home and watch finding nemo with my daughter.  yes it si rather shocking to become a mother and when i first did i always would think, "Me Heather a MOM???"  but after a while i realized that all of it is totally worth ti and totally meant to happen.  just look at your child and realize how much they he loves you and how much he trusts you.  just wait until he can start to walk and when you come home, he runs up to you screaming "MOMMY!!!  MOMMY'S HOME!!  I LOVE MY MOMMY!"  i think the rest of it just melts away...
but still be who you are, still do the things you wanna do... 
i still go to protests, still go out & mobilize and sometimes bring my daugther with...
don't worry... :D First, figure out what made your identity and why it can't any longer.  Everyone has different hobbies, but when I first became a mother, music was a serious passion and when my daughter was little, I still listened to it and I felt the same.
Find those traits that you once used to describe yourself nd live them out, enhance them. I totally went through all that! After BD, Riley and I had an apartment, I totally lost who I was. I ended up moving out with Riley, for awhile to find myself, and yea after that was when the beating and raped happened and we wont get into that. I just wanted you to know that I have been there! If you need to talk you can PM me. I think a lot has to do with the early months of your baby's life.  Newborns are so, so labor intensive, lol.  Their needs are just so immediate and all encompassing, it's hard to do anything else or think about much else.  It is normal to feel overwhelmed and overworked.  Are you able to take time for yourself each day, like a hot shower or bath while someone cares for your baby?  This can be amazing for helping you recoup and just have time to think. Get some good novels or non-fiction books on a subject you are interested in and read some while your baby nurses/naps/sits next to you checking things out.  But nap when baby does if you need to!  Can you put baby in a sling or stroller and get out for a walk every day or so?  If you feel ok leaving him with someone else, go out to the bookstore or for a cup of coffee or tea at the coffee shop for an hour or so.   Can you take a course at your local college, maybe a night course?  Or a correspondance course?  I've taken several online courses since my little ones were born and this really helps me to feel like I'm doing something for me.  I also read as much as possible because it gives me a deep sense of satisfaction to learn about whatever I'm interested in at the time, and I love to read.  My librarian has ceased to be suprised when I check out books on Japanese, pioneer life, gardening, and car repair all in one trip) haha.  If there is a hobby you were passionate about before your baby was born, can you take that back up?  My true love is technical theatre, and those long, irregular hours are (for me) not at all compatible with caring for my children.   So even though I don't work in university/professional theatre anymore, I still try to do community theatre where it's much more relaxed.   It just takes time to work out how to do the things you love with your child.  But it will come.  The early months are about learning to balance.  But I think it's totally possible to be an awesome mama (and partner) and continue to take care of yourself, enjoy your hobbies, and learn and grow in ways that you want to.   Geez I got rambly, hopefully this was helpful, hah! i remember feeling stressed out by all the new roles i had to play after my son was born as well.  i went from just a girl doing her thing, to someone's mother, someone's babymama, someone's partner, etc.  it can be overwhelming to have all of those roles, that seem so huge, come onto you at once.   but it gets easier, i promise.  even though my son is 3 now, occasionally i still have moments where i can't BELIEVE i'm someone's mother.  or where the stress of being a mom seems like its too much, and i'm not sure how to approach a role that should be "normal" to me by now. your life will change though, even if it wasn't a baby that changed you, it would be something.  it can seem like those people we were BEFORE we were moms were so complex or personalized, but you haven't lost anything about your identity or personality, you have only gained another aspect to your life.  think of being that baby's mama or a partner to your mate as just an added aspect to who you are.   it can be hard to nurture your self identity when you have a newborn though, we all know how tiring it gets.  but the other mamas have had some really awesome suggestions.  what helped me was to drink my favorite kind of tea whenever it was a quiet moment and i had a chance to sit with myself and think, or listen to my favorite kinds of music (crank it up, babies love music) that reminded me of my "old life" but also slowly became my baby's fav rockin to sleep tunes, or the music that he first danced to, or the soundtrack to those awesome nursing moments.  it can seem like the only person you are now is a diaper changer, baby feeder, laundry doer, or whatever else, but you are still a woman, not just a mom, so don't be afraid to nurture that side of yourself, unapologetically.  even if its just in small doses. *hugs* I go through that every six month, and my kid is two. I just haven't found a me I can settle with yet. I do remember the bars on my window starting to look like a cage to me. That was right before I got a job, and actually got out of the house once in a while. Puff dough, I have felt that way too, like my house is my cage. When I start to feel that way, I at least try to take a walk, or even go to the grocery store just to get out of the house! Emeraldfirefly, I have been trying to think of how to respond, but when my first baby was a newborn I was so lost in the experience I didn't even think about myself at all. It is now that I am really feeling like a caretaking machine. It can be hard to be the mama, and have someone new that you have to put first. I have been putting everyone else first, and it is taking a toll on me. I am finally realizing that it is OK for me to put myself first sometimes. With a tiny baby, you have to meet their needs immediately of course, but I have learned that it is OK for my baby to cry in daddy's arms if I need a break. Sure, he may really want me, but I know he's been fed, changed, and is in loving arms being well taken care of. And mama will come back feeling so much better and ready to play after a good long walk in the crisp winter air. Writing about my feelings also helps me feel more like a real person. It is a really good way to get in touch with yourself and your feelings. Another thing that is really important for you is to keep in touch with your body. If you are hungry, eat! IF you need to pee, pee! Don't forget to take care of yourself, and always drink lots of water, especially if you are nursing. Also, this is my advice to all mamas who are feeling worn out, especially mamas with new babies-- Don't be afraid to ask for help! Most people would be glad to help, but they don't know what you need unless you ask them. We are intelligent, strong, compassionate, socially aware, politically active, and eternally nurturing. Together, we will change the face of "teen parenthood."    Â© Girl-Mom. All rights reserved. Since 1999!  BABY MAMA Quotes BABY MAMA Quote Pictures Popular Authors

Most Read Egg donation agencies, which help infertile couples find egg donors, have recently barraged college and university newspapers with requests for donated eggs. Demand for donated eggs has driven up prices and caused a dramatic leap in compensation for Ivy League donors. Although no concrete numbers are available, Ivy League applicants are a small minority of all egg donors. Donor matching agencies say graduate students are much more likely to donate, making undergrad eggs all the more desired. While most egg donors receive a few thousand dollars in compensation for the process (sperm donors only make a paltry hundred), Ivy League girls are the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of the egg donation pool and routinely earn five-digit compensations.  An aspiring donor goes through an intensive screening process: agencies ask everything from favorite music, to how quickly one tans, to SAT scores, to the occurrence of asthma in the family. If a donor is paired with an infertile couple, she is treated with the drug Lupron to prime her body; the donor receives local anesthesia, and her eggs are âharvestedâ from the ovaries via needle, up to 40 at a time.  Although the process sounds relatively easy, the procedure is invasive and has some associated risk. As in-vitro fertilization and its associated procedures have only been popularly practiced for the last ten years, no long term analysis of the effect of egg harvesting or Lupron on the body is available.  Hilary Hanafin, a clinical psychologist with the Center for Surrogate Parenting and Egg Donation, commented on the process on the American Radio Networkâs âDecision to Donateâ series. She notes: âBeing an egg donor is a big decision. Itâs not like being a blood donor, and a 21- or 19-year-old undergraduate probably doesnât have the capacity to understand what sheâs getting into.â  And many students harbor questions over the processâ health, mental and ethical risks. âIâm worried about the type of drugs theyâre putting in your body and the effect they might have,â says Rebecca E. Wexler â05. Donation agencies assure donors that the procedure, thus far, has been relatively painless and successful. Over ten thousand babies from donor eggs have been born in the last decade and the vast majority of donors suffer no bodily harm. But Visiting Professor of Public Policy and Womenâs Studies lecturer Mary Ruggie warns, âthere will be more legal and ethical issues that will come up that we canât fathom.â  Most ethicists take issue with the marketplace created around Ivy League eggs, not with the donation process itself. A healthy, college-educated woman receives around $5,000 dollars for her egg donation; first-tier college students around twice that; Harvard, Stanford, Princeton and Yale students up to ten times that amount. Â  Â  Â  Â   Tiny Treasures LLC, a Somerville-based donation agency, creates a pool of âExtraordinary Donors.â According to their website, a donor with either an SAT over 1250, an ACT over 28, a GPA over 3.5, or enrollment at an Ivy League school, qualifies as an âExtraordinary Donorâ whose eggs are worth more than three times that of a first-time, well, normal donor. A Perfect Match, a California based donation agency, currently advertises in The Crimson and posted the infamous $50,000 offer for a tall, athletic, brunette.  In July 2002, the Presidentâs Council on Bioethics (online at www.bioethnics.gov) released âHuman Cloning and Human Dignity: An Ethical Inquiry,â which raised questions about the morality of the egg donation-for-cash trade. âWhen the âproductsâ are human beings, the âmarketâ could become a profoundly dehumanizing force,â the committee concluded. The report went on to question the âprospect of a new eugenicsâ arising from developments in IVF technology.  Indeed, one donation website posted photographs of nearly 50 available egg donors. The average donor advertised an SAT score over 1300, a weight below 130 and height over five feet, eight inches. However, most egg donation agencies avoid such advertising and stress that they help match couples with suitable donors.  Egg donation agencies believe that the couple seeking donation has every legal right to, and should, investigate and decide upon their own egg donor. The agencies stress that egg donation allows couples to experience a nearly natural pregnancy, providing an alternative to adoption, which is often legally and emotionally complicated.  But Ruggie describes that a âmarket factorâ has been created around donated eggs. âSome private insurances cover in vitro fertilization and assisted reproductive technology, but most donât. It becomes a debate as to whether the phenomenon of infertility should be medicalized and the consequences of wealth.â  Ultimately, the issue remains complex. But one woman awaiting donated eggs who asked that she not be named said the complexities are overridden by the benefits. âThis gives women the opportunity to have a child that is at least partially the genetic product of the couple,â she said. âIt also allows some women to experience pregnancy who otherwise couldnât.â   

Be the first to save!  Police nab woman, 27, in deadly stabbing Rina Perez was on her lunch break Wednesday from her job at Jackson Square Apartments when she got a bad feeling, she said. "Something just kept telling me to get to the job," Perez said. When she got back to the apartment building she manages at 1601 S. Jackson St., Perez saw "a lot of police everywhere," she said. But when she learned a man she knew had been killed there, Perez couldn't believe it, she said. Banquo "Ace" Dewond Logan, 31, died at the scene after being stabbed about noon in a third-floor apartment. Investigators from the Potter-Randall Special Crimes Unit recovered a knife at the scene and detained 27-year-old Charlene Morshay Carter. She later was arrested on a murder charge and booked into the Potter County Detention Center. Potter County Justice of the Peace Haven Dysart ordered an autopsy be performed on Logan's body today in Lubbock. Logan did not live at Jackson Square but often visited, Perez said. The attack occurred in the apartment of a friend he had helped to move out. "We were used to seeing him a lot," Perez said. Kris Yarbrough, maintenance man and night manager, said that after the stabbing, he called 911 from the manager's office, which is on the first floor. "She (Carter) came downstairs saying she was sorry, she was sorry," Yarbrough said. He said he thought Carter was an ex-girlfriend of Logan's and may have had an argument with him. Amarillo Homicides in 2004: January: 0 February: 0 March: 0 April: 0 May: 1 June: 1 July: 3 Total: 5 "Probably a 'baby-mama drama,"' Yarbrough said, referring to a suspected conflict involving Logan, Carter and Logan's current girlfriend. Perez said Logan and his girlfriend were expecting a baby this fall. "He was a real nice person," Perez said. "He was the type of person that loved kids." She said he always took time to chat with the children in the area, including her 2-year-old son. Sometimes he gave them dollar bills or bought them ice cream. "He wasn't even the type of person to have an attitude," Perez said. "He was always smiling, always joking around." Perez, who has been manager at Jackson Square for four years, said that in her job she is used to dealing with a variety of people and their problems. "(But) not something I haven't been able to handle - not until today," she said. Logan's death is Amarillo's fifth homicide this year. Three of those occurred this week, starting with a Sunday shooting that resulted in the death of Donald Paul Scholz, 23, on Tuesday. Three men have been charged in that case and two were in custody late Wednesday. On Tuesday, Kenneth Cottrell, 52, was found dead in his home at 2405 S. Crockett St. with multiple gunshot wounds. Investigators said they had few leads in that case. The Special Crimes Unit investigated 21 homicides in 2003 and seven in 2002.

Delivered, discarded Chico Classifeds Reader Comments Sign in to submit a comment: Post anonymous comment: Submit Your Comment   At a preliminary arraignment in Butte County Superior Court Tuesday, Gina Rose Grinsell, a 20-year-old Chico State sophomore accused of killing her newborn son, was charged with one count of murder and one count of assaulting a child with intent to kill. Both charges carry potential life sentences.

Prosecutors claim Grinsell strangled her baby with her bare hands after delivering it alone in her bedroom at the Kappa Sigma Delta sorority house on Cedar Street while her sorority sisters were having a party in another part of the house.

Grinsell appeared disheveled, distraught and on the verge of tears as she took her place before Judge Gerald Hermansen. She was calm as District Attorney Mike Ramsey read the grim charges against her, while many of the sorority sisters who had showed up to support her burst into tears.

The arraignment itself lasted only a few minutes. Before the proceedings began, Kappa Sigma Delta President Briana Nagle told reporters that she and the other inhabitants of the house were still in a âstate of shockâ over the incident. Nagle characterized Grinsell as âthe most caring person I knowâ and as someone was always willing to help a friend in trouble.

âItâs so surreal,â she said. âItâs like it hasnât hit yet. All the sisters are trying to carry on the best we can.â 
After the arraignment, Ramsey answered questions from reporters outside the courtroom. He said Grinsellâs baby was born healthy on the evening of April 1, while a social event involving 30-40 people went on in another part of the house. Apparently, no one heard Grinsell giving birth in her bedroom or checked to see if she was in her room. The baby, a 9.5-pound, 22-inch boy, was apparently born alive, Ramsey said, as an autopsy showed air in the babyâs lungs. The autopsy also showed bruises and marks on the babyâs neck where he had apparently been strangled within a few minutes of birth.

Grinsell may have tried to hide her pregnancy from her friends and certainly did hide it from her parents, Ramsey said. The child was found by a sorority sister the day after he was born in Grinsellâs bedroom. He had been wrapped in a plastic Wal-Mart bag and left in a bucket.

Authorities were apparently contacted by workers at a medical clinic to which Grinsell had been brought for a checkup, as her friends had become concerned about her condition.

The father of the child has not yet been found, though Ramsey said investigators were working on it. Grinsell apparently gave prosecutors a first name of a man who may be the father, but there were doubts as to the veracity of that statement. It is believed that the child was not the product of a âlong-term relationship.â 
When asked to speculate on Grinsellâs possible motive, Ramsey said, âAll of us need to understand that there is a huge âwhy?â here. Here we have a young woman who appears to have thrown her childâs life away, as well as possibly her own.â 
It isnât known whether Grinsell was aware that Californiaâs âSafely Surrendered Babyâ law allows for an unwanted child to be dropped off at a hospital with no questions asked and no charges brought. The law, which went into effect this year, was designed to prevent this type of tragedy from occurring.

Grinsellâs attorney, Dennis Lattimer, said Grinsell had never been in trouble before, was doing well in school and had the love and support of her family and friends. He declined to characterize her overall mental state, saying she had âlost a lot of bloodâ and was still upset and somewhat dazed from her ordeal. When asked what his defense strategy might be, Lattimer said he would be conducting his own investigation into the matter and would base his court strategy on the findings of that investigation.

Grinsellâs bail was set at $1 million. She will be formally arraigned  before Judge Robert Glusman on Monday, April 12.

Grinsellâs bail was set at $1 million. She will be formally arraigned  before Judge Robert Glusman on Monday, April 12.
		

		
		

		
		
	 When asked to speculate on Grinsellâs possible motive, Ramsey said, âAll of us need to understand that there is a huge âwhy?â here. Here we have a young woman who appears to have thrown her childâs life away, as well as possibly her own.â 
It isnât known whether Grinsell was aware that Californiaâs âSafely Surrendered Babyâ law allows for an unwanted child to be dropped off at a hospital with no questions asked and no charges brought. The law, which went into effect this year, was designed to prevent this type of tragedy from occurring.

Grinsellâs attorney, Dennis Lattimer, said Grinsell had never been in trouble before, was doing well in school and had the love and support of her family and friends. He declined to characterize her overall mental state, saying she had âlost a lot of bloodâ and was still upset and somewhat dazed from her ordeal. When asked what his defense strategy might be, Lattimer said he would be conducting his own investigation into the matter and would base his court strategy on the findings of that investigation.

        Unsubscribe   It happens every day! Men becoming dads, not by choice, but by accident.  And not with women they would choose to be their wife, but with women who will cause them 18 years of strife! Brethren, did you have the talk? Iâm talking about the talk every father must have with his son. The one every grandfather must have with his grandson and the one every uncle must have with his nephew. Iâm talking about the man-to-man talk about women, sex and making babies! The one where a young man is admonished to man up and donât become an accidental dad!  What is an Accidental Dad?
                     An accident is an unexpected, unplanned or undesirable event that usually happens suddenly and produces unfortunate, unwanted or unpleasant results. Accidents normally happen through carelessness, unawareness, ignorance, or a combination of the above. One of the worse things that can happen to a man, young or old, is becoming a dad by accident. In other words, becoming a dad through carelessness, unawareness, ignorance or sin. Did you notice that accidents are always unplanned, undesirable and unpleasant? Iâve been training men for over a decade and Iâve seen countless men in my workshops and conferences who became accidental dads. Truth be told, this is a detestable experience for most men! This is just (one of) the primary reasons why an alarming number of biological fathers eventually abandon both mother and child and why homicide is the leading cause of death amongst pregnant women.  Men, listen up! Becoming an accidental dad is almost always an unpleasant, weary and irritable event! Follow me closely as I walk you through this harrowing experienceâ¦ Many try to hide their displeasure from the expectant mother, but the gut wrenching tension between the two is irrefutable and becomes apparent almost instantaneously at the revelation of her pregnancy. Sheâs thinking heâs going to step up to the plate, be a man and take care of his child. She may even have grandeur ideas of matrimony. Or maybe lesser plans of possibly living together and getting married down the road. He on the other hand is thinking things such as:   (a) Hmmm, I wonder if this is really my kid? 
                       (b) Is she trying to trap me or what? 
                       (c) This shouldnât have happened, we used CONDOMS for Peteâs sake! 
                       (d) Iâm just not ready for a child 
                       (e) I hope she doesnât think Iâm going to marry her! 
                       (f) God, what have I done? I surely donât love her! 
                       (g) Sheâs nothing to me! She just a booty call!
                       (h) That bleep bleep told me she couldnât get pregnant
                       (i) That bleep bleep swore she was on birth control 
                       (j) That bleep bleep claimed she didnât want to get pregnant 
                       (k) That bleep bleep told me that she had a hysterectomy
                       (l) 
                       If she doesnât have an abortion, Iâm gonna go off! 
                       (m) 
                       Iâve got to figure out how to get out of this mess! 
                       (n) 
                       Iâll kill her before she gives birth to a baby with my DNA   Sex Traps 101
There are many dangers men face, but one of the most prominent dangers is one of the least talked about amongst men.  Itâs called: SEX TRAPS! When men engage in indiscriminate or casual sex or when they cohabit or choose the wrong woman to be their wife: they subject themselves to an onslaught of dangerous and sometimes deadly sex traps. For the sake of time, weâre going to focus our attention only on the sex traps related to becoming an accidental dad. Learn them well!  ((((( Sex Trap Alert )))))
                     The Wedding Trap
                     Surely youâve heard about men and women getting married solely because she is expecting. The plot works like this. A female gets pregnant, (usually intentionally) and then using either tears, duress or feminine wiles, snares the babyâs daddy into saying, âI do!â These women mar the entire female gender with their cunning scheme. Which is having a wedding ceremony and becoming a bride by entrapment! They masterfully manipulate a manâs sense of decency, his instinctive desire to protect, his desire to be revered as a man, his moral compass, his inclination to take care of his responsibilities and his lack of knowledge about cunning females. With most men, the guilt trip works like a charm. But the decision to grudgingly marry under such coercive conditions is one all most all men deeply regret. ((((( Sex Trap Alert )))))
                     The Child Support Trap
                     The average man doesnât understand the harsh reality of being snared in the (CSEA) Child Support Enforcement Agency. Read some of the atrocities they are forced to endure everyday.  (a) Their child support can be more than 40% of their take home pay! 
                       (b) The subversive threat of either paying child support or going to jail 
                       (c) While incarcerated they usually lose everything, job, car, house, etc. 
                       (d) If they miss a payment, they are subject to losing their driverâs license 
                       (e) The late payment fees are an excruciating 12% compoundingâ¦ 
                       (f) They are classified as a dead-beat dads no matter what they do 
                       (g) They face intense stress and ill feelings between them and the babyâs mom 
                       (h) One call from the babyâs mom can land them in jail with felon criminals 
                       (i) They must face the fact that there is no ceiling on child support 
                       (j) They are subject to increased child support payments every two years 
                       (k) It is virtually impossible to get their child support payments reduced
                       (l) 
                       A felony warrant issued for their arrest for past due child support payments  Câmon, letâs be honest, what sane men would sign up for this babyâs mama drama package if they understood what they were getting into?   Sheâs Got Papers On You!
There are multiple critical points men donât understand about what happens once a woman files a paternity suit against them. They donât realize they have just been SUED. They donât comprehend that the mother has become their adversary in fierce a lawsuit and that they are guilty until and unless they prove their innocence.  They donât understand that from henceforth they will be viewed and treated as a CRIMINAL with a Child Support Enforcement Agent acting as their parole officer. They donât apprehend that not only are they subject to having their driverâs license suspended, but the (CSEA) will suspend any and all of their professional licenses, ruin their credit, intercept unemployment checks and use any means necessary to destroy them financially if they pay late or fail or refuse to pay! They donât understand that once a child support order is issued against them, the babyâs mother has legal papers that empowers her to impede or altogether destroy their lives. They donât grasp the fact that once a female has papers on them, she can unjustly have a man incarcerated if she turns into an angry, bitter or jealous female. This happens daily! They donât discern that these females now forcefully control how much money they will be able to retain the next 18 to 21 years. It means that in most states, they are now subject to an unjust term called: judicial discretion. This allows a judge to set child support payments, not based on a manâs actual income, but what a judge injudiciously claims he is capable of earning. Hence the term: judicial discretion.  The men donât fathom that the states have federal incentives to set exorbitantly high child support payments. The higher the payments, the more money the states collect from the federal level! Unfair child support payments are a financial windfall to states coffers. I received this e-mail from a man who learned this evil truth the hard way.  âI just received my child support order... Justice WAS NOT served. I have to pay child support based on a salary almost two times what I make based on NO evidence other than the baby's mother claim that I was able to afford it. Please helpâ¦â  Men suffer this same injustice in the family court everyday! Jesus spoke about these unjust judges in Luke 18:2-6. The men are ordered to pay outrageous sums of money they can never afford and when they donât pay, they are classified as deadbeat dads and hounded as if they raped, robbed or murdered someone. You read it right!  Again I ask, âWhat sane men would sign up for this catastrophic deal if they knew what they were in for? This is why every dad, grandfather, uncle, mentor and pastor MUST have this talk with ALL YOUNG MEN until they get this chilling truth drilled into their heads!   ((((( Sex Trap Alert )))))
                     Paternity Fraud Predators
                     I coined the phrase, âPaternity Fraud Predatorsâ after talking with Carnell Smith, the founder and CEO of  US Citizens Against Paternity Fraud, and learning about the alarming number of females who commit a crime called paternity fraud. This is when they inform a man that he is the father of their child when he is not. The next and most important step is getting a child support order against the defrauded man. In Mr. Smithâs case, he lost a staggering $150,000 to a woman who claimed he was her babyâs daddy. After family friends urged him to take a  DNA Paternity test, he was shocked to find out that he was not the father of the child. It was a secret the mother hid from him for eleven years while she pocketed his hard earned money. In court it took her less than 30 seconds to name the true biological father of her child. The numbers are alarming! Although most women will usually swear, âHeâs my babyâs daddy!â The irrefutable fact is; one out of every three men who take a DNA paternity test, turn out not to be the biological father of the child! Did you read that? 1 out of 3! These scandalous females are defrauding untold numbers of men every year!  ((((( Sex Trap Alert )))))
                     Females Shopping For Disposable Dads
                     They used to be called goldâdiggers, but gold diggers is not a befitting term simply because these females are not just ripping men off financially. They are jeopardizing menâs lives and freedom. They also impact a 3 rd party - an innocent child. The scheme is simple. Find a target with steady income, seduce him, get pregnant, get a child support order against him and then order him to BE GONE!  The primary targets of these shameless she-devils are military men, professional athletes and other financially stable men. I coined the phrase âFemales Shopping For Disposable Dadsâ because once these females start collecting child support payments, they dispose of the babyâs daddy. And, âNo!â He doesnât get to see the child. They only interact with him if he is late with or misses a payment. Or, until it is time for them to petition the court for an increase in child support.  Iâve watched these trifling hellions snag up to fifty percent of a manâs take home pay and then laugh the men to scorn. Even worse, a number of these females donât even care about the child. For them, itâs all about the Benjamin$! They use childbirth to get paid! I know women who collect upwards of a $100,000 a year in child support from different men. Brethren, heed this warning, these hussies are ruthless!   ((((( Sex Trap Alert )))))
Can You Say, âTrojan Man!â
                     I know what some men are thinking because I hear it constantly: âGillis, I practice safe sex!â Men listen up! Using a condom MAY prevent pregnancy. The operative word is âMay!â Thatâs just like a man telling a woman, âI MAY marry you!â Or a child telling his parent, âI MAY go to school today!â The word âMAYâ means: the likelihood or possibility of.  No this for a certainty, there are countless men who are trapped in the child support enforcement system and THEY WERE WEARING A CONDOM! These men come to my workshops constantly. If you are depending on a condom to protect you from becoming an accidental dad, all I can say is, âYou are one cocksure man!â I took this warning off of the back of a Trojan condom box. Read it carefully:  Trojan Â® Brand latex Condoms, when used properly, are highly effective against pregnancy â although NO CONTRACEPTIVE CAN GUARANTEE 100% effectiveness.  Let me translate it for you. If you use this condom, there is a possibility and likelihood that it MAY protect you from becoming an accidental dad. However, they cannot guarantee you wonât get her pregnant! In the event the condom fails, no condom manufacturer is going to give you any legal assistance with your paternity suit. Nor, are they going to make your child support payments. I Spotted a Young Man Without Any Senseâ¦
                     Read this account of how many men make the perilous journey of becoming accidental dads. Proverbs 7:6-18 The Message [Emphasis added]
                       6 As I stood at the window of my house looking out through the shutters, 
                       7 Watching the mindless crowd stroll by,  I spotted a young man without any sense
8 Arriving at the corner of the street where she lived, then turning up the path to her house. 
                       9 It was dusk, the evening coming on, the darkness thickening into night. 
                       10 Just then, a woman met him--she'd been  lying in wait for him,  dressed to seduce him. 
                       11 Brazen and brash she was, restless and roaming, never at home, 
                       12 Walking the streets,  loitering in the mall, hanging out at every corner in town. 
                       13 She threw her arms around him  and kissed him, boldly took his arm and said, 
                       14 "I've got all the makings for a feast--today I made my offerings, my vows are all paid, --  She was playing church!
15 So now I've come to find you, hoping to catch sight of your face--and here you are! 
                       16 I've spread fresh, clean sheets on  my bed, colorful imported linens. 
                       17 My bed is aromatic with spices and exotic fragrances. 
                       18 Come,  let's make love all night, spend the night in ecstatic lovemaking!  Did you read the intelligence report on these impudent females? They lie in wait, they dress to seduce men and they throw themselves on men making it almost impossible for a man to resist having sex with them. So how does a man avoid their well-laid booby traps?  Read verse 7, again! He has to become a man who possesses some common sense! Iâve given you enough crucial information to help you be that type of man. You now understand whatâs at jeopardy. Read what other wise men say about these venomous skirts. Proverbs 5:3-4 Amplified Bible [Emphasis added]
                         3 For the lips of a loose woman drip honey as a honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil; 
                       4  But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged and devouring sword. Proverbs 6:24-28 Amplified Bible [Emphasis added]
                         24 To keep you from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a loose woman. 
                         25 Lust not after her beauty in your heart, neither let her capture you with her eyelids. 
                       26 For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a piece of bread, and  the adulteress stalks and snares [as with a hook] the precious life [of a man].  Men, I leave you with this charge, âYoung or old, donât be a man who does not posses common sense. Be a man of wisdom, righteousness and holiness. Be a man who is the master of his  sex drive!â If you allow your sex drive to rule you, it may be pleasurable for a season, but make no mistake about it, you are most likely headed down a perilous path of pain and regret! How do men end up becoming accidental dads? By carelessness, unawareness, ignorance and by living in SIN!  When you become a dad, you want to do so with a virtuous, trustworthy and loving WIFE! Not with a casual sex partner, one-night stand, booty call, stripper, party girl, super freak, gold-digger or some other wanton female who is going to turn this normally joyous occasion into a perpetual nightmare! Hereâs my final charge, read it carefully! Proverbs 7:24-25 The Message [Emphasis added]
                       24 So, friends, listen to me, take these words of mine most seriously. 25  Don't fool around with a woman like that; don't even stroll through her neighborhood. Be a man and MAN UP! Avoid the sex traps! Be the master of you sex drive. Learn to choose your mate wisely! Donât become an accidental dad!  Have an opinion about this article? We want to hear it!

				  In addition to having one of the largest personal record collections on the  planet, hip-hop's DJ savior, DJ Shadow, is one of the most revered DJs around.  And unless the bottom side of a rock has been your permanent address for the  past ten years, you've already familiarized yourself with his catalog, including Endtroducing, The Private Press, the UNKLE side-project, a couple  live mixes, and a few early 12-inch singles. Regardless of the type of release,  Shadow is always able to school the population on the most influential sounds  around.   Similar to Shadow's small distribution of the Diminishing Returns mix,  Funky Skunk is a very limited release (edition of 450). The disc itself is  an accompaniment to a package called Public Works for which Shadow collaborated  with graffiti artist Shepard Fairey. The package is quite impressive, including  several t-shirts and a book. But unfortunately, this particular disc is not an  "official" studio album.   In lieu of a new studio release, however, Shadow has clearly been spending some  time in the bedroom combining old and new hip-hop tracks into extensive  face-melting concoctions. And once again we get to reap the benefits. Also  similar to the first disc of Diminishing Returns, Funky Skunk  takes its listener on an exhaustive hour-long voyage through the history of  hip-hop. He briefly touches on some of the past rappers like Too Short, Beastie  Boys, Public Enemy, and even Young MC, while also incorporating newer artists  like David Banner and longtime friends Lateef the Truthspeaker and Lyrics Born.   Funky Skunk opens with one of its highlights, "Baby Mama," by Three 6 Mafia,  where Shadow has enhanced the bass and speed from the original to up the ante.  Actually, the first ten minutes of the mix is pretty damn sick. When some of the  older tracks are offered, it becomes immediately clear how far hip-hop and rap  have come since the early '80s. Calling the rhymes and beats outdated is  somewhat of an understatement, but their presence is essential and accurately  documented here.   There's a good chance you'll be able to spot a lot of the songs in this mix.  Unlike the usual Shadow construction, there's not a whole lot of focus on  extreme rarities. Instead, Funky Skunk boasts songs from the more famed  side of hip-hop. Many are enhanced with added touches of Miami bass and some are  mixed with psych-rock elements. There is, however, no mistaking that Funky  Skunk is a signature DJ Shadow creation.   If you're like me and you don't have a record collection that takes up a whole  house, Funky Skunk does a stellar job of summing up many years of hip-hop  in about an hour. Consider it a lesson of love from the man who took the genre  in a new direction less than ten years ago. It's impossible to say whether or  not this is indicative of what Shadow's new "in the works" album is to sound  like, but I'm certain that whatever it is, fans will be patiently waiting.       1. Funky Skunk

Girlfriendâs Baby Mama Drama
(For those baby mamas that be tripping)

You want to discuss this; I canât see a reason why. Iâm with this man, a man you used to claim, someoneâs name that I say every time we lay. Yes itâs true no longer will he come home to you, no longer will he desire you in that way, or any way for that matter. You have a child with him so any conversations you have outside of that are just chitter chatter.

Now you want to get violent, how childish and immature. You canât handle the truth so itâs my light-skinned face that you want to scar. I canât let that happen, oh no dear it wonât go down. Because see I donât have to touch you, I already wear his crown. He chooses me when he couldâve worked it out with youu. He comes home to me while youâre sitting down wondering how to come between us two. Donât waste your energy, heifer thereâs no chance. Thereâs nothing that he needs from you, not even that tired thing in your pants.

Okay let me chill, I do have to show some respect. You are and always will be the mother of his child, but that donât give a license to act crazy and wild. Donât call my house at all times of the night. Every time you see me donât be trying to fight. I swear when we all come together you better act right. If you choose to show out he will hate you for life. Iâm trying to give you a heads up before he does something out of spite. Then youâll be up all night tripping, wishing that you could ruin his life. Always remember your choices and your karma. Cause sweetheart Iâm letting you know right now, over here, we donât deal with baby mama drama.

       Over the last few days, Nashville star Chris Cagle's life has provided enough fodder for an album's worth of material.               The Anywhere but Here crooner released a statement on his Website Tuesday acknowledging that he is not the biological father of girlfriend Tammy Wheeler's baby.                "As many of you are aware, I had been anxiously awaiting the addition of a new baby to my life," the statement reads. "The baby has been born, and both mother and child are in good health.               "Since the birth, however, we have discovered that biologically the child is not mine."               The singer continues: "As excited as I was about becoming a new father, my disappointment now is equally strong. Out of respect for all that are involved, please allow this situation to remain private and know that I will not be commenting further on this very personal matter."               Wheeler's son, Cannon Dale, was born over the weekend, though no further details were released.                Though it would have been the first child for the country star, Cagle has experience as a father figure.               The "Chicks Dig It" songster was previously married to Texas schoolteacher Elizabeth Filer from 2001-03. Filer had two kids from a previous marriage.               "Those kids were the best thing I've ever found when I wasn't looking for anything," Cagle told Country Weekly in 2003.               "But I wasn't looking for children. I wasn't sure about that," he told the magazine. "But those babies are precious."               Cagle rose to fame in 2001 after the rerelease of his debut album, Play It Loud. The record spawned two number-one singles, "Laredo" and "I Breathe In, I Breathe Out."            Cagle is currently on tour supporting his third album, Anywhere but Here, which was released Tuesday on Capitol Records.

										Young Jeezyâs Hurricane Help Complicates Child-Support Case						
 Young Jeezy opened up his home last month to Hurricane Katrina victims, and now someone else is looking to him for support: the mother of his 9-year-old son. The rapper told MTV News in mid-September he was giving shelter to more than a dozen displaced strangers in his Atlanta mansion because he wanted to help them rebuild their lives (see âYoung Jeezy Opens His Home To Gulf Coast Disaster Victimsâ
). âI can only imagine what it was like to be there,â he said at the time. âThis is one of the times weâve got to come together. They can stay as long as they need.â But just a few days later, Young Jeezy, whose real name is Jay Jenkins, claimed in a deposition that he did not own a mansion nor any home whatsoever, according to Jim Rockefeller, a lawyer representing his former girlfriend Tynesha Nicole Dykes. Jeezy said in a September 26 deposition, and again in court on September 27, that he had no income other than a $35 per diem and that he owned no assets, no home, no car and no jewelry â despite his trademark iced-out Snowman pendant (see âYoung Jeezy Explains Symbolism Of The Snowmanâ
) â Rockefeller said. â[Young Jeezy] is one of the fastest-rising hip-hop/rap performers, with over a million records in sales in the past year and a mansion in Atlanta,â Rockefeller said. âHe lives in high styles, tours the country, and is the close company of stars like Jay-Z and BeyoncÃ©.â In contrast, Dykes lives in subsidized government housing and receives $178 a month in child support. Sheâs currently contesting this in court, and a judge has since ordered that Young Jeezy cooperate with the discovery process and disclose his income. If he earns up to $75,000 a year, Rockefeller said, Dykes is entitled to 20 percent by Georgia law. Any income above that, and the judge would be free to determine how much she should receive. Rockefeller said his client only wants âa reasonable amount. Sheâs not an opportunist. She is a loving mother who wants a decent lifestyle for her son.â The parties are due in court on Tuesday. Young Jeezyâs lawyer, Donald Woodard, declined to comment on the case, citing a policy of not speaking to the press about pending matters.

Hymowitz By Kay S. Hymowitz Read through the megazillion words on class, income mobility, and poverty in the recent New York Times series ÂClass MattersÂ and you still wonÂt grasp two of the most basic truths on the subject: 1. entrenched, multigenerational poverty is largely black; and 2. it is intricately intertwined with the collapse of the nuclear family in the inner city. By now, these facts shouldnÂt be hard to grasp. Almost 70 percent of black children are born to single mothers. Those mothers are far more likely than married mothers to be poor, even after a post-welfare-reform decline in child poverty. They are also more likely to pass that poverty on to their children. Sophisticates often try to dodge the implications of this bleak reality by shrugging that single motherhood is an inescapable fact of modern life, affecting everyone from the bobo Murphy Browns to the ghetto Âbaby mamas.Â Not so; it is a largely low-incomeÂand disproportionately blackÂphenomenon. The vast majority of higher-income women wait to have their children until they are married. The truth is that we are now a two-family nation, separate and unequalÂone thriving and intact, and the other struggling, broken, and far too often African-American. So why does the Times, like so many who rail against inequality, fall silent on the relation between poverty and single-parent families? To answer that questionÂand to continue the confrontation with facts that Americans still prefer not to mention in polite companyÂyou have to go back exactly 40 years. That was when a resounding cry of outrage echoed throughout Washington and the civil rights movement in reaction to Daniel Patrick MoynihanÂs Department of Labor report warning that the ghetto family was in disarray. Entitled ÂThe Negro Family: The Case for National Action,Â the prophetic report prompted civil rights leaders, academics, politicians, and pundits to make a momentousÂand, as time has shown, tragically wrongÂdecision about how to frame the national discussion about poverty. To go back to the political and social moment before the battle broke out over the Moynihan report is to return to a time before the countryÂs discussion of black poverty had hardened into fixed orthodoxiesÂbefore phrases like Âblaming the victim,Â Âself-esteem,Â Âout-of-wedlock childbearingÂ (the term at the time was ÂillegitimacyÂ), and even Âteen pregnancyÂ had become current. While solving the black poverty problem seemed an immense political challenge, as a conceptual matter it didnÂt seem like rocket science. Most analysts assumed that once the nation removed discriminatory legal barriers and expanded employment opportunities, blacks would advance, just as poor immigrants had. Conditions for testing that proposition looked good. Between the 1954 Brown decision and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, legal racism had been dismantled. And the economy was humming along; in the first five years of the sixties, the economy generated 7 million jobs. Yet those most familiar with what was called Âthe Negro problemÂ were getting nervous. About half of all blacks had moved into the middle class by the mid-sixties, but now progress seemed to be stalling. The rise in black income relative to that of whites, steady throughout the fifties, was sputtering to a halt. More blacks were out of work in 1964 than in 1954. Most alarming, after rioting in Harlem and Paterson, New Jersey, in 1964, the problems of the northern ghettos suddenly seemed more intractable than those of the George Wallace South. Moynihan, then assistant secretary of labor and one of a new class of government social scientists, was among the worriers, as he puzzled over his charts. One in particular caught his eye. Instead of rates of black male unemployment and welfare enrollment running parallel as they always had, in 1962 they started to diverge in a way that would come to be called ÂMoynihanÂs scissors.Â In the past, policymakers had assumed that if the male heads of household had jobs, women and children would be provided for. This no longer seemed true. Even while more black menÂthough still ÂcatastrophicallyÂ low numbersÂwere getting jobs, more black women were joining the welfare rolls. Moynihan and his aides decided that a serious analysis was in order. Convinced that Âthe Negro revolution . . . , a movement for equality as well as for liberty,Â was now at risk, Moynihan wanted to make several arguments in his report. The first was empirical and would quickly become indisputable: single-parent families were on the rise in the ghetto. But other points were more speculative and sparked a partisan dispute that has lasted to this day. Moynihan argued that the rise in single-mother families was not due to a lack of jobs but rather to a destructive vein in ghetto culture that could be traced back to slavery and Jim Crow discrimination. Though black sociologist E. Franklin Frazier had already introduced the idea in the 1930s, MoynihanÂs argument defied conventional social-science wisdom. As he wrote later, ÂThe work began in the most orthodox setting, the U.S. Department of Labor, to establish at some level of statistical conciseness what Âeveryone knewÂ: that economic conditions determine social conditions. Whereupon, it turned out that what everyone knew was evidently not so.Â But Moynihan went much further than merely overthrowing familiar explanations about the cause of poverty. He also described, through pages of disquieting charts and graphs, the emergence of a Âtangle of pathology,Â including delinquency, joblessness, school failure, crime, and fatherlessness that characterized ghettoÂor what would come to be called underclassÂbehavior. Moynihan may have borrowed the term ÂpathologyÂ from Kenneth ClarkÂs The Dark Ghetto, also published that year. But as both a descendant and a scholar of what he called Âthe wild Irish slumsÂÂhe had written a chapter on the poor Irish in the classic Beyond the Melting PotÂthe assistant secretary of labor was no stranger to ghetto self-destruction. He knew the dangers it posed to Âthe basic socializing unitÂ of the family. And he suspected that the risks were magnified in the case of blacks, since their ÂmatriarchalÂ family had the effect of abandoning men, leaving them adrift and Âalienated.Â More than most social scientists, Moynihan, steeped in history and anthropology, understood what families do. They Âshape their childrenÂs character and ability,Â he wrote. ÂBy and large, adult conduct in society is learned as a child.Â What children learned in the Âdisorganized home[s]Â of the ghetto, as he described through his forest of graphs, was that adults do not finish school, get jobs, or, in the case of men, take care of their children or obey the law. Marriage, on the other hand, provides a Âstable homeÂ for children to learn common virtues. Implicit in MoynihanÂs analysis was that marriage orients men and women toward the future, asking them not just to commit to each other but to plan, to earn, to save, and to devote themselves to advancing their childrenÂs prospects. Single mothers in the ghetto, on the other hand, tended to drift into pregnancy, often more than once and by more than one man, and to float through the chaos around them. Such mothers are unlikely to Âshape their childrenÂs character and abilityÂ in ways that lead to upward mobility. Separate and unequal families, in other words, meant that blacks would have their liberty, but that they would be strangers to equality. Hence MoynihanÂs conclusion: Âa national effort towards the problems of Negro Americans must be directed towards the question of family structure.Â Astonishingly, even for that surprising time, the Johnson administration agreed. Prompted by MoynihanÂs still-unpublished study, Johnson delivered a speech at the Howard University commencement that called for Âthe next and more profound stage of the battle for civil rights.Â The president began his speech with the eraÂs conventional civil rights language, condemning inequality and calling for more funding of medical care, training, and education for Negroes. But he also broke into new territory, analyzing the family problem with what strikes the contemporary ear as shocking candor. He announced: ÂNegro poverty is not white poverty.Â He described Âthe breakdown of the Negro family structure,Â which he said was Âthe consequence of ancient brutality, past injustice and present prejudice.Â ÂWhen the family collapses, it is the children that are usually damaged,Â Johnson continued. ÂWhen it happens on a massive scale, the community itself is crippled.Â  Johnson was to call this his Âgreatest civil rights speech,Â but he was just about the only one to see it that way. By that summer, the Moynihan report that was its inspiration was under attack from all sides. Civil servants in the Âpermanent governmentÂ at Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) and at the ChildrenÂs Bureau muttered about the reportÂs Âsubtle racism.Â Academics picked apart its statistics. Black leaders like Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) director Floyd McKissick scolded that, rather than the family, Â[i]tÂs the damn system that needs changing.Â In part, the hostility was an accident of timing. Just days after the report was leaked to Newsweek in early August, L.A.Âs Watts ghetto exploded. The televised images of the South Central Los Angeles rioters burning down their own neighborhood collided in the public mind with the contents of the report. Some concluded that the Âtangle of pathologyÂ was the administrationÂs explanation for urban riots, a view quite at odds with civil rights leadersÂ determination to portray the violence as an outpouring of black despair over white injustice. Moreover, given the fresh wounds of segregation, the persistent brutality against blacks, and the ugly tenaciousness of racism, the fear of white backsliding and the sense of injured pride that one can hear in so many of MoynihanÂs critics are entirely understandable. Less forgivable was the refusal to grapple seriouslyÂeither at the time or in the months, years, even decades to comeÂwith the basic cultural insight contained in the report: that ghetto families were at risk of raising generations of children unable to seize the opportunity that the civil rights movement had opened up for them. Instead, critics changed the subject, accusing MoynihanÂwrongfully, as any honest reading of ÂThe Negro FamilyÂ provesÂof ignoring joblessness and discrimination. Family instability is a Âperipheral issue,Â warned Whitney Young, executive director of the National Urban League. ÂThe problem is discrimination.Â The protest generating the most buzz came from William Ryan, a CORE activist, in ÂSavage Discovery: The Moynihan Report,Â published in The Nation and later reprinted in the NAACPÂs official publication. Ryan, though a psychologist, did not hear MoynihanÂs point that as the family goes, so go the children. He heard code for the archaic charge of black licentiousness. He described the report as a Âhighly sophomoric treatment of illegitimacyÂ and insisted that whitesÂ broader access to abortion, contraception, and adoption hid the fact that they were no less ÂpromiscuousÂ than blacks. Most memorably, he accused Moynihan of Âblaming the victim,Â a phrase that would become the title of his 1971 book and the fear-inducing censor of future plain speaking about the ghettoÂs decay.  That RyanÂs phrase turned out to have more cultural staying power than anything in the Moynihan report is a tragic emblem of the course of the subsequent discussion about the ghetto family. For white liberals and the black establishment, poverty became a zero-sum game: either you believed, as they did, that there was a defect in the system, or you believed that there was a defect in the individual. It was as if critiquing the family meant that you supported inferior schools, even that you were a racist. Though ÂThe Negro FamilyÂ had been a masterpiece of complex analysis that implied that individuals were intricately entwined in a variety of systemsÂfamilial, cultural, and economicÂit gave birth to a hardened, either/or politics from which the country has barely recovered. By autumn, when a White House conference on civil rights took place, the Moynihan report, initially planned as its centerpiece, had been disappeared. Johnson himself, having just introduced large numbers of ground troops into Vietnam, went mum on the subject, steering clear of the word ÂfamilyÂ in the next State of the Union message. This was a moment when the nation had the resources, the leadership (the president had been overwhelmingly elected, and he had the largest majorities in the House and Senate since the New Deal), and the will Âto make a total . . . commitment to the cause of Negro equality,Â Moynihan lamented in a 1967 postmortem of his report in Commentary. Instead, he declared, the nation had disastrously decided to punt on JohnsonÂs Ânext and more profound stage in the battle for civil rights.Â ÂThe issue of the Negro family was dead.Â Well, not exactly. Over the next 15 years, the black family question actually became a growth industry inside academe, the foundations, and the government. But it wasnÂt the same family that had worried Moynihan and that in the real world continued to self-destruct at unprecedented rates. Scholars invented a fantasy familyÂstrong and healthy, a poor manÂs Brady BunchÂwhose function was not to reflect truth but to soothe injured black self-esteem and to bolster the emerging feminist critique of male privilege, bourgeois individualism, and the nuclear family. The literature of this period was so evasive, so implausible, so far removed from what was really unfolding in the ghetto, that if you didnÂt know better, you might conclude that people actually wanted to keep the black family separate and unequal.  Consider one of the first books out of the gate, Black Families in White America, by Andrew Billingsley, published in 1968 and still referred to as Âseminal.Â ÂUnlike Moynihan and others, we do not view the Negro as a causal nexus in a Âtangle of pathologiesÂ which feeds on itself,Â he declared. Â[The Negro family] is, in our view, an absorbing, adaptive, and amazingly resilient mechanism for the socialization of its children and the civilization of its society.Â Pay no attention to the 25 percent of poor ghetto families, Billingsley urged. Think instead about the 75 percent of black middle-class familiesÂthough Moynihan had made a special point of exempting them from his report.  Other black prideÂinspired scholars looked at female-headed families and declared them authentically African and therefore a good thing. In a related vein, Carol Stack published All Our Kin, a 1974 HEW-funded study of families in a midwestern ghetto with many multigenerational female households. In an implicit criticism of American individualism, Stack depicted ÂThe Flats,Â as she dubbed her setting, as a vibrant and cooperative urban village, where mutual aidÂincluding from sons, brothers, and uncles, who provided financial support and strong role models for childrenÂcreated Âa tenacious, active, lifelong network.Â In fact, some scholars continued, maybe the nuclear family was really just a toxic white hang-up, anyway. No one asked what nuclear families did, or how they prepared children for a modern economy. The important point was simply that they were not black. ÂOne must question the validity of the white middle-class lifestyle from its very foundation because it has already proven itself to be decadent and unworthy of emulation,Â wrote Joyce Ladner (who later became the first female president of Howard University) in her 1972 book TomorrowÂs Tomorrow. Robert Hill of the Urban League, who published The Strengths of Black Families that same year, claimed to have uncovered science that proved LadnerÂs point: ÂResearch studies have revealed that many one-parent families are more intact or cohesive than many two-parent families: data on child abuse, battered wives and runaway children indicate higher rates among two-parent families in suburban areas than one-parent families in inner city communities.Â That science, needless to say, was as reliable as a deadbeat dad. Feminists, similarly fixated on overturning the Âoppressive ideal of the nuclear family,Â also welcomed this dubious scholarship. Convinced that marriage was the main arena of male privilege, feminists projected onto the struggling single mother an image of the Âstrong black womanÂ who had always had to work and who was Âsuperior in terms of [her] ability to function healthily in the world,Â as Toni Morrison put it. The lucky black single mother could also enjoy more equal relationships with men than her miserably married white sisters.  If black pride made it hard to grapple with the increasingly separate and unequal family, feminism made it impossible. Fretting about single-parent families was now not only racist but also sexist, an effort to deny women their independence, their sexuality, or both. As for the poverty of single mothers, that was simply more proof of patriarchal oppression. In 1978, University of Wisconsin researcher Diana Pearce introduced the useful term Âfeminization of poverty.Â But for her and her many allies, the problem was not the crumbling of the nuclear family; it was the lack of government support for single women and the failure of business to pay women their due.  With the benefit of embarrassed hindsight, academics today sometimes try to wave away these notions as the justifiably angry, but ultimately harmless, speculations of political and academic activists. ÂThe depth and influence of the radicalism of the late 1960s and early 1970s are often exaggerated,Â historian Stephanie Coontz writes in her new book, Marriage, a History: From Obedience to Intimacy, or How Love Conquered Marriage. This is pure revisionism. The radical delegitimation of the family was so pervasive that even people at the center of power joined in. It made no difference that so many of these cheerleaders for single mothers had themselves spent their lives in traditional families and probably would rather have cut off an arm than seen their own unmarried daughters pushing strollers.  Take, for instance, Supreme Court Justice William Brennan, who wrote a concurring assent in the 1977 Moore v. City of East Cleveland decision. The case concerned a woman and her grandson evicted from a housing project following a city ordinance that defined ÂfamilyÂ as parentsÂor parentÂand their own children. Brennan did not simply agree that the court should rule in favor of the grandmotherÂa perfectly reasonable position. He also assured the court that Âthe extended family has many strengths not shared by the nuclear family.Â Relying on Robert HillÂs Âscience,Â he declared that delinquency, addiction, crime, Âneurotic disabilities,Â and mental illness were more prevalent in societies where Âautonomous nuclear families prevail,Â a conclusion that would have bewildered the writers of the Constitution that Brennan was supposedly interpreting. In its bumbling way and with far-reaching political consequences, the executive branch also offered warm greetings to the single-parent family. Alert to growing apprehension about the state of the American family during his 1976 presidential campaign, Jimmy Carter had promised a conference on the subject. Clearly less concerned with conditions in the ghetto than with satisfying feminist advocates, the administration named a black single (divorced) mother to lead the event, occasioning an outcry from conservatives. By 1980, when it finally convened after numerous postponements, the White House Conference on the Family had morphed into the White House Conference on Families, to signal that all family forms were equal. Instead of the political victory for moderate Democrats that Carter had expected, the conference galvanized religious conservatives.  Later, conservative heavyweight Paul Weyrich observed that the Carter conference marked the moment when religious activists moved in force into Republican politics. Doubtless they were also more energized by their own issues of feminism and gay rights than by what was happening in the ghetto. But their new rallying cry of Âfamily valuesÂ nonetheless became a political dividing line, with unhappy fallout for liberals for years to come. Meanwhile, the partisans of single motherhood got a perfect chance to test their theories, since the urban ghettos were fast turning into nuclear-family-free zones. Indeed, by 1980, 15 years after ÂThe Negro Family,Â the out-of-wedlock birthrate among blacks had more than doubled, to 56 percent. In the ghetto, that number was considerably higher, as high as 66 percent in New York City. Many experts comforted themselves by pointing out that white mothers were also beginning to forgo marriage, but the truth was that only 9 percent of white births occurred out of wedlock. And how was the black single-parent family doing? It would be fair to say that it had not been exhibiting the strengths of kinship networks. According to numbers crunched by Moynihan and economist Paul Offner, of the black children born between 1967 and 1969, 72 percent received Aid to Families with Dependent Children before the age of 18. School dropout rates, delinquency, and crime, among the other dysfunctions that Moynihan had warned about, were rising in the cities. In short, the 15 years since the report was written had witnessed both the birth of millions of fatherless babies and the entrenchment of an underclass. Liberal advocates had two main ways of dodging the subject of family collapse while still addressing its increasingly alarming fallout. The first, largely the creation of Marian Wright Edelman, who in 1973 founded the ChildrenÂs Defense Fund, was to talk about children not as the offspring of individual mothers and fathers responsible for rearing them, but as an oppressed class living in generic, nebulous, and never-to-be-analyzed Âfamilies.Â Framing the problem of ghetto children in this way, CDF was able to mount a powerful case for a host of services, from prenatal care to day care to housing subsidies, in the name of childrenÂs developmental needs, which did not seem to include either a stable domestic life or, for that matter, fathers. Advocates like Edelman might not have viewed the collapsing ghetto family as a welcome occurrence, but they treated it as a kind of natural event, like drought, beyond human control and judgment. As recently as a year ago, marking the 40th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, CDF announced on its website: ÂIn 2004 it is morally and economically indefensible that a black preschool child is three times as likely to depend solely on a motherÂs earnings.Â This may strike many as a pretty good argument for addressing the prevalence of black single-mother families, but in CDF-speak it is a case for federal natural-disaster relief.  The ChildrenÂs Defense Fund was only the best-known child-advocacy group to impose a gag rule on the role of fatherless families in the plight of its putative constituents. The Carnegie Corporation followed suit. In 1977, it published a highly influential report by Kenneth Keniston called All Our Children: The American Family Under Pressure. It makes an obligatory nod toward the familyÂs role in raising children, before calling for a cut in unemployment, a federal job guarantee, national health insurance, affirmative action, and a host of other childrenÂs programs. In a review in Commentary, Nathan Glazer noted ruefully that All Our Children was part of a Ârecent spate of books and articles on the subject of the family [that] have had little if anything to say about the black family in particular and the matter seems to have been permanently shelved.Â For that silence, childrenÂs advocates deserve much of the creditÂor blame. The second way not to talk about what was happening to the ghetto family was to talk instead about teen pregnancy. In 1976 the Alan Guttmacher Institute, Planned ParenthoodÂs research arm, published ÂEleven Million Teenagers: What Can Be Done About the Epidemic of Adolescent Pregnancy in the United States?Â It was a report that launched a thousand programs. In response to its alarms, HEW chief Joseph Califano helped push through the 1978 Adolescent Health Services and Pregnancy Prevention and Care Act, which funded groups providing services to pregnant adolescents and teen moms. Nonprofits, including the Center for Population Options (now called Advocates for Youth), climbed on the bandwagon. The Ford and Robert Wood Johnson Foundations showered dollars on organizations that ran school-based health clinics, the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation set up the Too Early Childbearing Network, the Annie E. Casey Foundation sponsored ÂA Community Strategy for Reaching Sexually Active Adolescents,Â and the Carnegie, Ford, and William T. Grant Foundations all started demonstration programs. There was just one small problem: there was no epidemic of teen pregnancy. There was an out-of-wedlock teen-pregnancy epidemic. Teenagers had gotten pregnant at even higher rates in the past. The numbers had reached their zenith in the 1950s, and the ÂEleven Million TeenagersÂ cited in the Guttmacher report actually represented a decline in the rate of pregnant teens. Back in the day, however, when they found out they were pregnant, girls had either gotten married or given their babies up for adoption. Not this generation. They were used to seeing children growing up without fathers, and they felt no shame about arriving at the maternity ward with no rings on their fingers, even at 15. In the middle-class mind, however, no sane girl would want to have a baby at 15Ânot that experts mouthing rhetoric about the oppressive patriarchal family would admit that there was anything wrong with that. That middle-class outlook, combined with post-Moynihan mendacity about the growing disconnect between ghetto childbearing and marriage, led the policy elites to frame what was really the broad cultural problem of separate and unequal families as a simple lack-of-reproductive-services problem. Ergo, girls Âat riskÂ must need sex education and contraceptive services. But the truth was that underclass girls often wanted to have babies; they didnÂt see it as a problem that they were young and unmarried. They did not follow the middle-class life script that read: protracted adolescence, college, first job, marriageÂand only then children. They did not share the belief that children needed mature, educated mothers who would make their youngstersÂ development the center of their lives. Access to birth control couldnÂt change any of that. At any rate, failing to define the problem accurately, advocates were in no position to find the solution. Teen pregnancy not only failed to go down, despite all the public attention, the tens of millions of dollars, and the birth control pills that were thrown its way. It went upÂpeaking in 1990 at 117 pregnancies per 1,000 teenage girls, up from 105 per 1,000 in 1978, when the Guttmacher report was published. About 80 percent of those young girls who became mothers were single, and the vast majority would be poor. Throughout the 1980s, the inner cityÂand the black familyÂcontinued to unravel. Child poverty stayed close to 20 percent, hitting a high of 22.7 percent in 1993. Welfare dependency continued to rise, soaring from 2 million families in 1970 to 5 million by 1995. By 1990, 65 percent of all black children were being born to unmarried women.  In ghetto communities like Central Harlem, the number was closer to 80 percent. By this point, no one doubted that most of these children were destined to grow up poor and to pass down the legacy of single parenting to their own children.  The only good news was that the bad news was so unrelentingly bad that the usual bromides and evasions could no longer hold. Something had to shake up what amounted to an ideological paralysis, and that something came from conservatives. Three thinkers in particularÂCharles Murray, Lawrence Mead, and Thomas SowellÂthough they did not always write directly about the black family, effectively changed the conversation about it. First, they did not flinch from blunt language in describing the wreckage of the inner city, unafraid of the accusations of racism and victim blaming that came their way. Second, they pointed at the welfare policies of the 1960s, not racism or a lack of jobs or the legacy of slavery, as the cause of inner-city dysfunction, and in so doing they made the welfare mother the public symbol of the ghettoÂs ills. (Murray in particular argued that welfare money provided a disincentive for marriage, and, while his theory may have overstated the role of economics, itÂs worth noting that he was probably the first to grasp that the country was turning into a nation of separate and unequal families.) And third, they believed that the poor would have to change their behavior instead of waiting for Washington to end poverty, as liberals seemed to be saying.  By the early 1980s the media also had woken up to the ruins of the ghetto family and brought about the return of the repressed Moynihan report. Declaring Moynihan Âprophetic,Â Ken Auletta, in his 1982 The Underclass, proclaimed that Âone cannot talk about poverty in America, or about the underclass, without talking about the weakening family structure of the poor.Â Both the Baltimore Sun and the New York Times ran series on the black family in 1983, followed by a 1985 Newsweek article called ÂMoynihan: I Told You SoÂ and a 1986 CBS documentary, The Vanishing Black Family, produced by Bill Moyers, a onetime aide to Lyndon Johnson, who had supported the Moynihan report. The most symbolic moment came when Moynihan himself gave HarvardÂs prestigious Godkin lectures in 1985 in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of ÂThe Negro Family.Â For the most part, liberals were having none of it. They piled on MurrayÂs 1984 Losing Ground, ignored Mead and Sowell, and excoriated the word Âunderclass,Â which they painted as a recycled and pseudoscientific version of the Âtangle of pathology.Â But there were two important exceptions to the long list of deniers. The first was William Julius Wilson. In his 1987 The Truly Disadvantaged, Wilson chastised liberals for being Âconfused and defensiveÂ and failing to engage Âthe social pathologies of the ghetto.Â ÂThe average poor black child today appears to be in the midst of a poverty spell which will last for almost two decades,Â he warned. Liberals have Âto propose thoughtful explanations for the rise in inner city dislocations.Â Ironically, though, WilsonÂs own Âmismatch theoryÂ for family breakdownÂwhich hypothesized that the movement of low-skill jobs out of the cities had sharply reduced the number of marriageable black menÂhad the effect of extending liberal defensiveness about the damaged ghetto family. After all, poor single mothers were only adapting to economic conditions. How could they do otherwise? The research of another social scientist, Sara McLanahan, was not so easily rationalized, however. A divorced mother herself, McLanahan found AulettaÂs depiction of her single-parent counterparts in the inner city disturbing, especially because, like other sociologists of the time, she had been taught that the Moynihan report was the work of a racistÂor, at least, a seriously deluded man. But when she surveyed the science available on the subject, she realized that the research was so sparse that no one knew for sure how the children of single mothers were faring. Over the next decade, McLanahan analyzed whatever numbers she could find, and discoveredÂlo and beholdÂthat children in single-parent homes were not doing as well as children from two-parent homes on a wide variety of measures, from income to school performance to teen pregnancy. Throughout the late eighties and early nineties, McLanahan presented her emerging findings, over protests from feminists and the ChildrenÂs Defense Fund. Finally, in 1994 she published, with Gary Sandefur, Growing Up with a Single Parent. McLanahanÂs research shocked social scientists into re-examining the problem they had presumed was not a problem. It was a turning point. One by one, the top family researchers gradually came around, concluding that McLanahanÂand perhaps even MoynihanÂwas right. In fact, by the early 1990s, when the ghetto was at its nadir, public opinion had clearly turned. No one was more attuned to this shift than triangulator Bill Clinton, who made the family a centerpiece of his domestic policy.  In his 1994 State of the Union Address, he announced: ÂWe cannot renew our country when, within a decade, more than half of our children will be born into families where there is no marriage.Â And in 1996, despite howls of indignation, including from members of his own administration (and mystifyingly, from Moynihan himself), he signed a welfare-reform bill that he had twice vetoedÂand that included among its goals increasing the number of children living with their two married parents. So, have we reached the end of the Moynihan report saga? That would be vastly overstating matters. Remember: 70 percent of black children are still born to unmarried mothers. After all that ghetto dwellers have been through, why are so many people still unwilling to call this the calamity it is? Both NOW and the National Association of Social Workers continue to see marriage as a potential source of female oppression. The ChildrenÂs Defense Fund still wonÂt touch the subject. Hip-hop culture glamorizes ghetto life: Â Âcause nowadays itÂs like a badge of honor/to be a baby mamaÂ go the words to the current hit ÂBaby Mama,Â which young ghetto mothers view as their anthem. Seriously complicating the issue is the push for gay marriage, which dismissed the formula Âchildren growing up with their own married parentsÂ as a form of discrimination. And then there is the American penchant for to-each-his-own libertarianism. In opinion polls, a substantial majority of young people say that having a child outside of marriage is okayÂthough, judging from their behavior, they seem to mean that itÂs okay, not for them, but for other people. Middle- and upper-middle-class Americans act as if they know that marriage provides a structure that protects childrenÂs development. If only they were willing to admit it to their fellow citizens.  All told, the nation is at a cultural inflection point that portends change. Though they always caution that Âmarriage is not a panacea,Â social scientists almost uniformly accept the research that confirms the benefits for children growing up with their own married parents. Welfare reform and tougher child-support regulations have reinforced the message of personal responsibility for oneÂs children. The Bush administration unabashedly uses the word ÂmarriageÂ in its welfare policies. There are even raw numbers to support the case for optimism: teen pregnancy, which finally started to decline in the mid-nineties in response to a crisper, teen-pregnancy-is-a-bad-idea cultural message, is now at its lowest rate ever. And finally, in the ghetto itself there is a growing feeling that mother-only families donÂt work. ThatÂs why people are lining up to see an aging comedian as he voices some not-very-funny opinions about their own parenting. ThatÂs why so many young men are vowing to be the fathers they never had. ThatÂs why there has been an uptick, albeit small, in the number of black children living with their married parents. If change really is in the air, itÂs taken 40 years to get hereÂ40 years of inner-city misery for the country to reach a point at which it fully signed on to the lesson of MoynihanÂs report. Yes, better late than never; but you could forgive lost generations of ghetto men, women, and children if they found it cold comfort.

The basic design is simple, but the implementation was mostly a pain.  This is constructed of sport weight baby yarn.  I knitted with two stands at once and had 8 active yarn sources at all times. At each verticle color change I had to cross the yarns to form a strong join. So every 3 or 4 rows I had to completely detangle the yarn. This will be the last plaid blanket I will ever make, so I took lots of pictures.  I wanted the blanket to be reversable, so I alternated between knit and purl squares.  The blanket is edged with four rows and 3 stitches of moss stitch.
 
Afghans, Baby

 I love plaid and I definitely love this plaid baby blanket. I can imagine the pain that this one was to knit but the final product is gorgeous! Great job!

  "I was born near Greensboro in what was then Choctaw county. My mama was 
  Millie Drain an' I had a outside papa. (He was Bob Jones.) My mama had several 
  chillen born to her but me an' my brother Anderson Drain is the only ones 
  livin now. Anderson, he jus' ten years younger 'n me. I 'member he born de 
  year befo' de war ceasted. I was nursin' him when we was freed. They tells me 
  I was ten years old then an' that's all I knows 'bout my age." 

  "We lived in little log houses dobbed wid mud an' didn't have no beds---slept 
  on de ground on pallets. We eat out o' troughs down at Marsa's back doo' an et 
  wid muscle shells fo' spoons." 

  "My Mama an' her sister Cenie was sold. Mama used to slip back at night an' 
  bring us things an' de white folks never knowed it. It sho' would-a went hard 
  wid her if dey'd ever caught her." 

  "My job durin' slavery days was toatin' water an' pickin' up chips. I wasn't 
  like de other little niggers---my head wasn't flat on top an' old Missus saw I 
  couldn't tote nothin' on my head. Other niggers could bring a bucket o' water 
  on their head an' one in each hand. I was allus a sickly baby. My guts come 
  down in my navel an' I never was well 'till I got grown. When I was a little 
  baby Mama used to leave me in de cabin by my self fo' hours at a time. Old 
  Miss tell Mama: "Go down to dat house an' see if dat little nigger aint dead." 
  They said I was allus a good baby." 

  "Old Miss sho' had a time wid me an' her little chickens. I jus' loved little 
  chickens to death. I 'member she wouldn't let me round 'em cause she'd 'fraid 
  I'd hurt em an' one day I slipped off in de woods where de old hen an her 
  bunch was. I caught every one of em an' bit their heads off. Dat old hen 
  fought me 'till my face was covered in blood when I got to de house." 

  "Mama never did 'low us to dance. I never did low my chillen to dance either. 
  I 'member gettin' off one time an' tryin' to dance when they wasn't nobody 
  'round an' stumped my toe. It broke me tho'. I never did try it no mo. I sho 
  like to broke my toe tho'." 

  "I 'member hearin' my nigger women say: "So glad I's free! So glad I's free!" 
  De war was over an' they didn't have no boss. I 'member Mama tellin' 'bout de 
  Yankees cuttin' de cloth out de loom an' gettin' up on it with their horses. 
  They took de feather beds an' throwed 'em way but after they was gone we found 
  em." 

  "Mama said she had a better time in slavery days then after they was freed. 
  She was a house girl. I's heard some hollowin': "Oh pray Mistus." Law me, dey 
  would be gettin' some whippin'. These women dat didn't work in de field sho' 
  had their four rolls to spin a day. Mama said she'd allus get hers---sometime 
  she'd finish at night but heep o' de women had to have a whippin' 'fore theirs 
  was done an' then they'd sho' get busy." 

  "I was 18 years old when I married Charlie Holman an' he was even 21. My 
  weddin' dress was made out o' dis swiss cloth an' trimmed in blue ribbon. I 
  wore a bow on my head an' had a big bow 'round my waist. My, I thought I was 
  steppin' out! We lived in de Tom Holman place in Choctaw county. I don't know 
  'xactley how long we lived there but we stayed in Louisiana eight years. I 
  tells em dat was de hottest place I ever seen. De buds start swellin' in' de 
  spring an de women start swellin' too. More babies there 'n I ever seen. Dis 
  summer I'd be settin' in de corner great big an next summer I'd be settin in 
  de corner great big again. I's de mother o' eighteen an' ain't got but three 
  now. De Lord sho' saw fit to take 'em. I was jus' a good breeder. I liked 
  livin' in Louisiana 'cept I jus' didn't like havin' so many chillen. We moved 
  out there in a ox wagon an' it took three weeks to move there. Had a good old 
  dog stayed wid us an' kept de boogers off on de trip. When we moved back we 
  come on de train. When we got back from Louisiana we moved over in Webster 
  county, near Eupora wid Mr. Estel Bridges an' we's been 'round here ever 
  since." 

  "I belong to de Baptist church. Didn't join 'till I's plum grown. I knowed 
  what I was doin'. We's all got to be regenerated an' born again befo' we 
  leaves dis old world. I tell you de old Time Religion is de best kind o' 
  ligion."

Nas' Baby Mama Tells All...
 Click play to watch a video of Carmen Bryan (the mother of Nas'daughter Destiny)in an interview talking about her upcoming tell-all book. In her book, "It's No Secret", she does a Superhead and gives detailed stories of her various sexcapades with celebrities such as Nas, Jay-Z and Allen Iverson. Click the link below the video to read a chapter from her book over at "Crunk & Disorderly". I have my fingers crossed that Oprah won't fall for this chick's nonsense (like she did with Superhead) and invite her on the show. I wonder if these women even think about how these tell-all books will affect their children. I'm sure Nas and Carmen's daughter is old enough to know what's going on. Children aren't as naive as we think they are. Click Here to Read a Chapter from Her Book at C&D

Each part of this baby blanket is made in a lace design from a different country.  This is all sport weight soft baby yarn.  The border was all sewn continuous on a very long round knitting needle.  I give that credit to my Boye modular knitting needle set.  This is an English lace pattern.  All the salmon and green stripes are made in an Italian lace pattern.  This is a Spanish lace pattern.  This is a French lace pattern.  This is a colonial American lace pattern that forms the edging. 
 
Afghans, Baby

 Yes, Iâm opening up oldâ¦.something.
Anyways, Iâve spent the morning looking for a pattern or instructions for spanish lace, and I think this is the best result I have found. From my motherâs description, I think your pattern matches what we have been looking for. Do you know where I can find instructions for this particular stitch? It is from A Treasury of Knitting Patterns by Barbara G. Walker and published by Schoolhouse Press.  There is also a Second and Third volume in the series and all are excellent resources for knitting stitches. Iâd like to ask where you got the american lace pattern because I absolutely love yours. That one is from A Second Treasury of Knitting Patterns by Barbara G. Walker, Corona, Chapter 11 Eyelets, pg 250 and the english lace as well if you donât mind me asking. That one is from A Treasury of Knitting Patterns by Barbara G. Walker, Fern or Leaf-Patterned Lace, Chapter 10 Lace, pg 208

According to the Miami Herald, Danielâs attorney Jason Setchen recently filed court documents naming Storch as the childâs father and requesting custody and child support. Daniel gave birth to Jalen Scott Storch, now 4 months old, on April 16. In her financial affidavit, the 29-year-old woman says she is unemployed, has no funds in the bank and lists her only assets as an â03 Pontiac Grand Am and an â04 Chevrolet Monte Carlo with a combined value of $21,000. Since Storch failed to respond to Danielâs paternity suit Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Marc Schumacher issued a default judgment declaring Storch the âlegal, natural, and biological father.â Schumacher will decide child support, attorneyâs fees and other issues at a later date. While Storchâs failure to respond has reflected poorly on the multimillionaire producer, he claims he was out of the country in St. Tropez and âmissed a court date,â but is now working to resolve the matter. âI would never, ever be a deadbeat dad,â Storch told the Miami Herald.  -article courtesy of SOHH.Com

 The Carmen Bryan Files: Did Jay-Z Give Nas Baby Mama a STD?  MrsQ
Just me   Member since 6/06 11378 total posts Name:Qiana The Carmen Bryan Files: Did Jay-Z Give Nas Baby Mama a STD?  Carmen Bryan was on Gossip Wendy William's show discussing being passed around between Nas, Jay-Z, and Allen Iverson. One thing that popped up was she confirmed that she got a STD (chlamydia) from either Nas or Jay-Z and Nas adamantly denied it. Carmen sounds like she believes Nas. Also Carmen confirms she was pregnant with Jay-Z's baby. Wendy William's probably covered most of Carmen's book in the extensive interview. Carmen says basketball star Allen Iverson is a better lover than Jay-Z but Jay-Z is packing more than Nas. Oddly, Carmen comes across as intelligent and makes some good points.Here are the audio clips of the interview:Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4  Diva
I am what I am  Member since 12/05 2825 total posts Name:Jennifer Re: The Carmen Bryan Files: Did Jay-Z Give Nas Baby Mama a STD?  I was inquiring about this yesterday.  Although I heard the majority of Carmen's interview (who obviously makes a living off being a ho), I was curious to know if Nas called into the show.What really burned me about this interview was the fact that she claimed she wouldnt discuss her daughter because she was trying to protect her, yet what kind of example is she teaching her by glorifying this lifestyle?    sweetie

Everyone's had a ride and she could have easily gotten from someone else. She's just looking to sell more books and figures this juicy tidbit will get more people to buy.   sweetie

 The Fight for a Man's RightsDid you know that if you don't show up to paternity court, you could be named some child's father by default? According to some shit I just read at XXL, that's just what happened to "Lean Back" producer Scott Storch recently. A Miami woman name Dalene âDaeâ Jennifer Daniel has filed a paternity suit against the highly sought after beatmaker which cites him as the father of her infant son Jalen Scott Storch. Daniel claims that she is currently unemployed and her only assets are two cars valued at $21,000.Since Storch chose not to respond to the suit, a Miami judge declared Storch the âlegal, natural, and biological fatherâ by default. Child support and other financial issues will be determined at a later date. Does this mean that a broad can just name her baby Lemonjelo Byron Crawford and all of a sudden it's mine just because I was too busy to make it to court that day? If so, that's just wrong. Also, how did this broad get two cars worth $21,000 if she's "currently unemployed." To give you an idea, you'd need literally 17.5 of my cars to equal that value, and I work all the time. Fortunately, I'm getting a new car later this week that's going to put me square in the $6,000 range. Another thought: How do you think Scott Storch's momma or, god forbid, his real girlfriend is going to feel knowing he dropped it off in a broad named Dalene "Dae" Daniel? A woman shouldn't just be allowed to destroy a man's life like this. Click here to subscribe to my new weekly email newsletter Life in a Shanty Town

        (Atlanta, ga)
      
     
        Ten years ago I was in a relationship with a woman I considered myself to be in love with. I asked her to marry me and while we were engaged she got pregnant. Now let me preference this by saying that she had one child when we met as did I. I had explicitly explained to her that we could not afford another child at that time and that we needed to pool our money together to get our own place as she was living with her parents at the time. Well I learned that she was not the one for me and broke off the engagement. Shortly thereafter when my son was born I decided that maybe we could make it work as I didn't want to have another child out of wedlock. So we got engaged a second time but still we couldn't make it work so I moved on. Years later after I had found someone new she decided that she wanted to get back together but at that point it was too late. When she found out I was getting married - my child is now five - she went to the courts to file child support. Even though I was giving her money and trying to see my son when she wasn't being difficult. Now we are going back and forth in child support court because they are trying to make me pay more than I can afford. I make my payments on time google_ad_client="pub-2041108528225718";google_ad_width=250;google_ad_height=250;google_ad_format="250x250_as";google_ad_type="text";google_ad_channel="";google_color_border="FFFFFF";google_color_bg="FFFFFF";google_color_link="000099";google_color_url="CCCCCC";google_color_text="000000";and they still garnished my wages and suspended my license without my knowledge. I drive for a living, if I had gotten arrested for a suspended license I would have lost my job and no one would have gotten child support. But still I have to pay for the incompetence of our child support system but yet I get no visitation with my son. She is contesting legitimation because she doesn't want me to have any rights. I feel that the law should state unless a woman is willing to not contest to legitimation and visitation that she deserves no child support. So now I am paying a woman that purposely quit her job so that I can support her and her three children which only one is mine. But I don't get to help raise my son and he wonders why his daddy won't come and see him. The laws are crazy. They are not in the best interest of the child. I think us non-custodial parents should ban together and change the laws. Whose with me?Trey's Thoughts: When trying to work things out with a woman who does not want to be with you can be hurtful and hard, especially if you both have a child together. I was very young when I had my son and did not know the system as well as I do now. Learning how the child support system works can work to your advantage if you know what to look for.

             Bookmarks Thread Tools Search Thread Forum Rules  Tom Cruise, Baby's Mama, Son Ready For Some Football! Follow Tom Cruise? Tom Cruise Biography Tom Cruise Tom Cruise Photos Tom Cruise Quotes Tom Cruise Videos Over the weekend, we saw actor Tom Cruise and his baby's mama, Katie Holmes, taking in a soccer match featuring his daughter, Isabella. Last night, Tom and his son, Connor, took in the Washington Redskins' opener in Landover, Md., along with Holmes. It was a bit of business and pleasure, as Cruise, who was recently given the pink slip by Paramount, recently signed a deal with 'Skins owner Daniel Snyder, who will finance his production company. Here's TomKat and Connor, photographed on the sidelines last night:  Despite all the hullabaloo over the recently-revealed Suri Cruise, Tom is showing that he's still a huge part of his other two children's life. Both Connor and Isabella were adopted by Tom and ex-wife Nicole Kidman. We applaud his efforts as a good family man. So why don't you just step off, Moby! N-n-n-nobody listens to techno! While T.H. Gossip has taken plenty of shots at Cruise's insanity, we've never been accused of failing to give props when and where they are due. Some of our staff members have been accused of petit larceny, driving without insurance, disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace and urinating in public, but that's neither here nor there.  I was feeling pressed in the interview with Matt Lauer. For me, my issue was really about child drugging. It's not like it is today, like people are really kind of openly talking about this.  I can't even articulate it, to be honest. That feeling, that connection. Just who she is and what she means to me. Submissions? Questions? Looking to advertise?

According the NY Daily News, Artest is fighting in family court for full custody of his youngest son Jeron.  Sources say this comes after his former girlfriend, Jennifer Palma, refused sex with him even though he is married with three children. After this incident he cut her $2,800 a month housing support and took his case to court. Where by the way he was representing himself, must be feeling the 5 million dollar loss from his suspension. Well the morale of this story is donât say no to Ron Arrtest.  Baby Mama gifs that i madeâ¦Â     Slowly but surely they are coming. Itâs not that they are incredibly difficult, its just that this week in particular has been busyâ¦      View Full Version : If we get married will I then be responsible for his child support payments??  dallaspenn.com STACEY DASH, My 2007 Baby Mama 22 Responses to âSTACEY DASH, My 2007 Baby Mamaâ Leave a Reply  I am mad that STACEY DASH is so fucking gorgeous in the photo shoot she did for the upcoming Playboy magazine.  I admit that I slept on Ms.DASH as B.M. status.  Yeah, I wanted to beat her little seat, but I didnât want to bust up in it.  After I saw these photos I realized that I need to get one of her eggs.  I know cloning is immoral and the whole nine, but what if you could go to the supermarket and get a carton of STACY DASH eggs?  I would put those in a cup and drink them. [Editorâs note:  if you canât open the above link you will need to get a password from BLU CHEEZ] I feel a little fucked up about going to the newsstand and buying this magazine since I too want Black women to be portrayed by the media in the proper light.  Speaking of light(ing), the scenes that Playboy is using are wonderfully lit and they really show Ms.DASHâs marvelous 40year old physique.  Fuck what your heard, STACEY has made 40 the new 20 and I want to pummel fire out of her cocoa tanned backside.  I want to beat her little pum pum up like she said something bad about my mommaâs cooking.  I want to see if I can leave my handprint on her firm, oil-sheened azz. Getting back to the whole media image thingâ¦  I think itâs a powerful feminist statement that STACEY DASH is making by posing in Playboy.  She is taking control of her image by not letting it be exploited by lesser publications like Maxim, Blender or Black Tail.  Playboy is not pimping STACEY DASH, she is pimping Playboy. Who am I kidding?  The STACEY DASH Playboy mag is a collectorâs item along with the VANESSA WILLIAMS Penthouse and the JAYNE KENNEDY Playboy. STACEY DASH is the ultimate hustler.

 I canât hate. She looks good. (My husband agrees 100%). Iâm a fan ever since clueless. Sheâs been in the entertainment business for quite a while so my question is . . . why now? What does she expect to accomplish and what is she trying to say? She she hard up for money or for attention? I donât buy all that Playboy is classy and Maxim, KING, FHM, Stuff, etc. is low-grade. She posed nude, sheâs no different from any of the other ladies on-line paying their bills. Note, most of the girls pose so they can get into acting, not necessarily the other way around. At the end of the day, Iâm not mad, I will get the magazine. SHE IS SUPER-FINE! Iâm still into Toccara posing for KING. Homegirl looks damn good to have had two kids. Playboy has always been the âclassierâ of menâs magazines as that arena goes. And I am sure she got a lot more  from Playboy than she would have gotten from Maxim and King. She doesnât need to do it for the money more than like but if your gonna do it might as well get paid for it I guess.  Hmmm wonder what Dame had to say bout that??? The things I would do herâ¦ [â¦] Stacy Dash: My 2007 Baby Mama DallasPenn.com was created for events like the Stacey Dash Playboy spread. [â¦] I would like to add that Stacy Dash does not look fine enough to take her clothes off. She should keep them on. ^earl = teh ghey i think shes the finest 40 year old ive ever seen She Looks O MAZING. Hope I Look That Good At 40. She Turned Me On. O My God. D tell stacy to get at me PLEASE she is all that Earl, you must be drinking the koolaid Â´cause even with 3 kids and a husband I can see she is all that!   Somebody needs to tell Janet how good genes REALLY work. (ducking from the legions of defenders!) (*sidebar* I âseenâ her joints before but am I missing anyother gouda or port wine in that category that I need a PW?) G, when I get back home I will have BLU CHEEZ hit you with a DP dot com username and p.w. this way you can view the inter-racial love pix without Rafi getting his speed oâs all up in a bunch. SHE IS FINE AS FUCK HATTERSâ¦â¦ Stacey is the most beautifulliest woman in the world. And If I had 24 hours to live I would fuck her the 23 hours and then that final hour Iâll say a prayer and gracefully bow out the world. Oh yeah and before I go beyonce aint got shit on stacey and as far as halle is concerned she is second class and stacey is in a class by herself or may I say a Dash by herself. damn stacey you are sexy I went to high school in Paramus, NJ with this sweet piece of ass.  Damn, if I only knew then how hot she would be.   She is one fine piece of chocolate well stacey dash looks really nice and looks very young to be over 40 keep it up stacey Yes Dee Dee, Stacey keeps it up. The quality of the info is what keeps me on this site, thanks!

The Baby Mama war is on and Kim and Sarah are playing it out in the press. In the new issue of Essence Magazine, the high-self esteem and very intelligent Kim Porter says: Itâs one thing when you donât know  (the man in the relationship); then you get a pass. But if you know and youâre still doing wrong, then thatâs a problem. Iâm not going to befriend, or even deal with someone who would go thereâ Now itâs time for Kim to ride on Sarah, she says she wonât let Diddyâs kids go near Sarahâs daughter, their own blood sister: Christianâs got two beautiful sisters. He ainât thinking about the other one. , trust me when I tell you. That situation is over there, and this is over here and I ainât got nothing to do with thatâ Someone tell this broad she has a lot to do with it. We can hear Kim Porter on the phone ridinâ on Saraâs voicemail now, âwho is getting more checks b*tchâ?  Essence scans via Gheto Fabu  Ask YOUR

  Hi Hog,  My boyfriend of 8 months has a child with someone else. 
I also have a child with someone else. But his ex is always calling him saying 
how much she screwed up and how much she loves him. But she left him and their 
daughter. I have no respect for her. 

He doesn't tell her to stop calling because he doesn't want to be mean. He just 
makes me deal with it and I don't think it's fair. 

They talk on the phone and he said he will always be there for her when she 
needs someone. I don't feel he should go out of his way to always be there for 
her. Why do they need to know what's going on in each other's lives? I only talk 
to my ex when it's about my daughter.  So when my boyfriend talks to his ex she always brings 
up the past and talks about them getting back together. I told him how I feel 
but it's like he thinks it's a joke. I think he likes two girls fighting over 
him. I just don't know if I can deal with this. I don't know if that's 
selfish. It's makes me angry, jealous, and worry all the time.  - N Hog's Relationship Advice: Wow. You guys are carrying more baggage than will fit in 
the overhead compartment and seat floor in front of you.

Yes, his baby's mama is trying to get him back.

Yes, it would seem that he enjoys the attention. 

Will he leave you to go back to her?

Hmm...

This is tricky because he needs to see his child. But you're right, he shouldn't 
be encouraging his baby mama's behavior by allowing her to get sentimental. Your situation is the reason that Albert Einstein 
coined the phrase "Baby Mama Drama." Your dude needs to be straightforward with his baby's 
mama.

He also needs to get some sort of court order that guarantees he will be able to 
see his child. And he needs to be honest with you about his 
feelings. It's okay for a guy to have friends who are girls outside the 
relationship, but not when those girls want to f*ck him and kiss him and 
suck on his jammy like it was the straw in the bottom of her almost-empty Pina 
Colada. <Insert sound effect of enthusiastic slurping.> To win any negotiation, you need to be willing to walk 
away. As painful as it may be, can you walk away from him?

If you can, then ask him to be a man and make the decision: Does he want to get 
back with his baby-mama or be with you? Because he can't have you both.

NOTE: But if he could, that would be pretty cool. Because there'd 
be threesomes and cat-fights. 

Yeah, of course he likes 2 girls fighting over him. If feels great! What 
an ego boost! You girls are used to guys hitting on you and and fussing over 
you. For us guys, we rarely have 1 girl who wants us!  So you need to show him that you will not allow this 
current situation to continue. Don't threaten him. Don't get angry. There 
is a reason he is not with her and he's with you. So you are obviously 
doing something right in your relationship with him. <Insert sound effect of enthusiastic slurping.>

Show him that you love him. And remind him that you are woman to be 
respected. And if he truly cares for you and loves you, he will stop the 
games. HA HA HA! Just kidding! Men are pigs! He's going to 
totally sha-boink her! Then he will get caught. Then you will dump him. Then 
he'll be back with his baby's mama. Then she'll start acting like her old self 
and leave him again. Then he'll be alone. And he'll be spending every night with 
his old-old girlfriend that met on the internet: ".jpg"  It's your job to save him from himself! This is the 
role of women in American society. To lift a man from his base desires and make 
him want to be a better person. If your dude wants to keep his baby's mama in his life, 
this is very delicate. He still cares for her. But why?

He needs to focus his love and attention on his new life with you. 

The best thing that could happen is that his baby's mama finds a new
man. Then she will stop obsessing over your man.

So my advice to you? Find her a new man!

Go out and put up her profile on every dating site, MySpace, hell -- post her 
picture on every telephone pole in town!

Get this woman a date!

Once she has this need satisfied, she will stop yearning for what was... because 
she will be too happy with what is.

By the way, this is what your boyfriend should be doing, too. Being happy with
what is instead of talking about what was. <Insert sound effect of enthusiastic slurping.> Word, hogsta.

Never mind the precious peanut. Where my damn diamonds? (BTW, this is us in 2004; I didnât just go have a baby and blog the same day.) I so did not get a push present. And believe me, my pregnancy and delivery bit. Gifts for new mothers are all the rage these days, say propoganda sites like BabyCenter.com. Said The New York Times yesterday: In a more innocent age, new mothers generally considered their babies to be the greatest gift imaginable. Today, they are likely to want some sort of tangible bonus as well. This bonus goes by various names. Some call it the âbaby mama gift.â Others refer to it as the âbaby bauble.â But itâs most popularly known as the âpush present.â Thatâs âpushâ as in, âI the mother, having been through the wringer and pushed out this blessed event, hereby claim my reward.â Or âpushâ as in, âIâve delivered something special and now Iâm pushing you, my husband/boyfriend, to follow suit.â This is offensive on so many levels I donât know where to begin. Yes, I do. First off, no one I know got diamond baubles or pricey art work just for having a baby. Secondly, no mom I know would ever demand such a thing as the price of pushing out a pup. But thirdly, if a new daddy wanted, on his own volition, to bestow his honey with a token of his love and appreciation, what the hell is wrong with that? Fourth, the article denies it, but this smacks of one more corporate plot to invent another gift-giving occasion. Clara Jeffery of Mother Jones captures my sentiment exactly in a blog post titled, âHereâs Your Damn Baby, Now Where Are My #@%&ing Diamond Earrings?â It is not the fact that Moms are getting a token of their hard work that bugs me, it is that you know that the diamond industry has their hands in this. Just as they invented a âtraditionâ of diamond wedding rings, the âthree months salaryâ rule, and the âthree-stone anniversary ring.â Hey, you can hear DeBeersâ pitchmen saying: Why not a carat for each pound of baby? Donât you care, Dad? Hereâs the push present Iâd want: sleep.  Angela Nazario is Larry Fitzgeraldâs Baby Mama! (Photos) 24 Responses to âAngela Nazario is Larry Fitzgeraldâs Baby Mama! (Photos)â Recent Comments Right Fielders Tweets Follow Us on Twitter! **Updated photo thanks to one of our readers below** Whatâs the deal with those Arizona Cardinals players?  TMZ is reporting that Angela Nazario (I canât find anymore photos of her except the one above), is claiming that Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald, Jr. is her unborn babyâs daddy!!  See a biography of Angela here!
 Angela claims that she and Fitzgerald had a sexual relationship and he is not denying that fact, but he is requesting that a DNA paternity test be done on the baby after it is born.   See the court docs here.  Nazario wants child support from Fitzgerald (cha-ching!), and he states that he will provide that if he is declared the father.   A source close to Nazario revealed that Larry wanted her to âhide outâ in Arizona and wanted her to have an abortion.  There are claims that he tried to bribe her with houses and cars but when she refused his bribes, he said that he âdidnât need this all over the news like Matt Leinartâ.  I donât think Larry will be posting this news on his website.  Heh heh. More photos of Angela Nazario will be below as they become available.
 **Thank you to one of our readers for the tip on the updated photo of Angelaâ¦**

I personally know Angie and it is true she is nothing but a golddigger just like her fellow Southwest Airline Flight Attendant (aka Skywaitress) Susan.  I would not be surprised if she put a hold in the condom herself or purposely stopped taking birth control. She also dated Dan Majerle for awhileâ¦ Sheâs not even cute.. He couldve at least knocked up a cuter looking girl!!! Angie is not a goldigger!  Why donât you people with no life whatsoever get your facts straight.   IDIOTS!!!!!!! why oh why dont these black men learn their lessons from oj and kobeâ¦ leave the white women alone.. they dont get them fake boobs and fake lips and fake butts for nothing. Plus they want to sex a black man and  RICH ONE IS EVEN MORE LIKE HAVING  THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS! Pages: [1] 2 3 Â» Show All  Ask MetaFilter "Baby Mama Drama" Drama

  Brian Urlacher's Baby Mama Drama Other Interesting Stories send a tip Newsletter Istaverse contribute About all our citiesone convenient app We love watching him run from sideline to sideline, snuffing out running backs, or intercepting passes with one hand and running the ball back fifty yards.  Off the field, however, Brian Urlacher just doesn't seem very bright. The Bears' star middle linebacker finds himself back in court in a battle over custody and visitation rights for his two-year-old son, Kennedy.  Kennedy's mother, Tyna Robertson, revealed over thirty text messages Urlacher sent her since January using language that makes us suspect that Urlacher might be a guest commentator on some of our posts.  Yesterday, Urlacher told a Will County judge that he "couldn't remember" sending messages to Robertson that suggested she was raising Kennedy to be a "little pussy," among other things. Granted, Robertson isn't exactly the squeaky clean sort, having once sued "Lord of the Dance" maestro Michael Flatley for rape, asking for $35 million in the process.  A judge threw that suit out and allowed Flatley to sue Robertson for defamation of character and extortion.  We're not saying she's a gold digger, but there is such a thing as a life change, and often the catalyst is a baby. Robertson and Urlacher might want to consider the effects that their arguing has on young Kennedy.  As he grows up, it'll be fairly easy for Kennedy to look up articles on his proud football playing dad and see that he once called his mother a "hooker" and that she should "make one of (her) pimps drive (her) around." It ain't the nuclear family, but it's what they have. Sign up for Chicagoist Daily, which will deliver the day's most popular stories to your inbox at 5 p.m. every day!

ON BLAST! LOVER OF DOWNLOW R&B SINGER SPEAKS!!
 January 29, 2007: One of MediaTakeOut.com\'s faithful readers named J.B. asked us to put an R&B; artist ON BLAST!. Apparently J.B. and this artist have been in a down low relationship for some time and J.B. just discovered that the artist is cheating. Before we put this R&B; artist On Blast!, we\'ve decided to give him one last chance to make things right. MediaTakeOut.com will give the artist (who we know regularly visits our site) 7 days to call J.B. and apologize. If after 7 days, he hasn\'t apologized, we\'ll let everyone know who he is. Here is J.B.\'s sad story: 
    For the past 6 months, I have been in a DL relationship with R&B; singer [The Artist]. We met in Atlanta after he did a show for a music fest on the south side of town. I was a little disappointed in his performance at first because I am use to seeing him bring the house down, but he was high and tipsy. We greeted backstage where he slipped me his number and I met him later on that night at his hotel. I don\'t think his crew knows because we went to another room once they fell out from getting blazed.     He was not sure how to take me and vice versa, but after a few long night conversations and connections, he knew I could be trusted. Everything was all good until his baby mama drama blew out the water. She has not accepted the fact that they are no longer together, as far as he told me. I even flew out to Chicago to stay with him a few days during this mess his ex girl created.     After a few weeks of non stop drama with her and her crew, I told him it was best that we be friends from afar or until the drama she was causing simmered down. I was at peace about the situation until I found out he was seeing some other guy and some other girl on and off through a close friend in Chicago. Not only do I feel betrayed, but I feel like I was violated. I was looking to marry him, but our connection really began to blossom as he sent me gifts and love notes all the time.     Given that he has a son and was trying to remove himself from a bad situation, I stood by the idea of having a friend and lover that built up to more than sex. We went out when he was in town and even had dinner in public together. I comforted him through his personal struggles day and night and even tried do improve his album sales of the last album (that did not do hot on the charts).     I am a huge fan of his music, but I refuse to be a sideline ho and I feel the other [EXPLETIVES] and hoes he playing should know the dog they messing with. I prayed things would never come to this, but [the Artist] needs to know that once a good dude goes bad, he\'s gone forever. All dogs don\'t go to heaven. You had a great thing with me. I carry my own and never asked you for anything. I will go on record and say that I have messed with other industry [EXPLETIVES], but I never allowed myself to get attached or drawn because of [EXPLETIVE] like this.

Big Screen Little Screen  Poehler is Tina Fey's 'Baby Mama' 2 Responses Leave a Comment  Ted Zee - Seattle, WA Tips & correspondence: ted.bsls[at]gmail.com  Diversionary Recent Posts  SlashFilm has the first image available for the Tina Fey and Amy Poehler reunion vehicle, Baby Mama, due out from Universal in the Spring.  In what seems like not much of a stretch from her 30 Rock persona, Fey plays Kate, a 37 year-old single executive whoâs looking to have her first child.  After learning that sheâs unable to have one naturally, she pegs lower-class South Philly girl Angie (Poehler) as her surrogate.  Baby comedy turns buddy comedy when Angie loses her place and Kate finds her at her doorstep. Seems promising (if not predictable) enough, though potential would be higher with the former SNL writer pals as scribes, which they were not. Forecast is for broad comedy as screenplay and (first-time) direction is by Michael McCullers, who penned two Austin Powers sequels, as well as Undercover Brother.  Greg Kinnear, Dax Shepard, and Sigourney Weaver also star.  Release is scheduled for April 18th, 2008.

NFLer Osi Umenyioraâs Got Some BABY MAMA DRAMA!!!
 December 4, 2007: MediaTakeOut.com reported to you a few months ago that NFL Pro-Bowler Osi Umenyiora and a Tennessee woman named Sharika welcomed a beautiful baby boy into the world. Well it's now looking like the relationship between Osi and Sharika has hit a rough patch. You see, one of MediaTakeOut.com's faithful readers ran into Shakira at a popular Nashville nightspot. And our nosy reader overheard the former video vixen talking to one of her girlfriends about her relationship with the NFL baller. Here' what our reader overheard her say: Any athlete would love to have a video model, but I never claimed him as my boyfriend. Who cares if he thinks I'm not wife material. I managed to have his baby, I don't need Osi for anything else...."  EDITOR'S UPDATE - Sharika contacted us personally to refute the claims of our reader. According to Sharika, her and Osi are doing just fine. Well that's good to hear - cause they do make a great looking couple...

 Get 4 Free Issues! NBA star, Latrell Sprewell, most recently with the Minnesota Timberwolves, is being sued by the mother of his four children. Candace Cabbil, Latrellâs baby-mama says the ball player broke a long term "cohabitation" agreement the two made in 1989 when they first met, stating that Latrell would share his life and fortune with her. This suit in effect involves and affects the coupleâs four kids, ages 3, 7, 8, and 11. Candace says the star recently got rough with her in their N.Y., home, as well as has been giving her less money for their children and other household expenses and becoming less involved in their family. She also alleges that Latrell has a 16-year-old child with another woman, that she has had to take guardianship over.  Candace says she had to quit her own job, in a hospital, after having their first child and was promised that she would not have to worry about being taken care of, despite not getting married or putting her name on the lease of their $3 million home.

Not up to vintage "Scrubs" standards, but an improvement nonetheless, if for no reason than that JD resembled an actual human being for most of the episode. (And I think we have to allow for some percentage of whimsical prima donna JD -- the guy who refused to accept that Kim could hate his hair -- because that was a part of the character even in the slightly more realistic seasons.) We even got our first mostly heartfelt scene between JD and Dr. Cox since maybe "My Lunch" and "My Fallen Hero." The Kim/pregnancy plot was a bad idea from start to finish -- not least which because it only allowed the very funny Elizabeth Banks to actually be funny in her very first episode and this one -- but at least we've come to a reasonable conclusion to it. No dead baby angst (other than whatever JD felt during the stupid fake miscarriage portion of last season), but also no more "trapped in an unhealthy relationship" angst. The show already has two other babies in Isabel and JD Cox, so if the writers don't want to show JD interacting much with his own, they don't have to, and if they want to show how weird he would be with a newborn, they can do that, too. The video game subplot was pretty lightweight, but it allowed for the Janitor's completely demented (and, I have to assume, improvised by Neil Flynn) monologue to his vanquished video foe, and there were other funny things on the margins like the homeless Dr. Kelso waiting for his 'za, Fun-Sized Intern struggling to speak with a normal tone, and the stealth first appearance of the late Nurse Laverne's twin sister. (For those who don't know, Bill Lawrence promised the actress that if he killed Laverne off and the show got renewed, he'd recast her as Laverne's twin so she wouldn't be out of work -- and so the show wouldn't be without one of its many comic voices.) And, of course, any episode with Colin Hay emerging from Kim's birthing canal can't be all bad, can it? What did everybody else think?

Month after month, year after year, those payments!  So I called my baby girl, Kareesha, to come over to my house, and when she got there, I said to her, "Baby girl, I want you to take this last check over to your mother's house and tell her that this is the last check she's ever going to get from me, and I want you to come back and tell me the expression that's on her face."  So my baby girl took the check over to her. I was really anxious to hear what she had to say and what she looked like.. As my baby girl walked through the door, I said, "Now what did she have to say?" "She told me to tell you that you ain't my daddy, and to watch the expression on your face.

  OK, I was out of pocket when this hit the media, but what do you think Eddie Murphy and his management team are saying since DNA tests prove that he is the father of Melanie âScary Spiceâ Brownâs baby? As you know, Murphy would not claim paternity until DNA tests had been performed. Now that the world knows heâs the daddy, hopefully these parents will stay focused on the well-being of this child, Eddieâs other children and not their relationship.

             Today Tonight Skies clearing overnight. Cloudy skies this evening will become partly cloudy after midnight. Low 22F. Winds light and variable.  Updated: February 17, 2016 @ 5:55 pm When Jim Berry came to work Wednesday morning, he immediately became sick to his stomach.Â  Kokomoâs boys basketball team made the lengthy ride to Fort Wayne Wayne on Tuesday for its third game in four days. Community Howard Regional Health Indiana needs reasonable environmental rulemaking GOOD TIMES: New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is shown in this June 2005, file photo arriving with his girlfriend, actress Bridget Moynahan, at team owner Robert Kraft's home in Brookline, Mass. GOOD TIMES: New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is shown in this June 2005, file photo arriving with his girlfriend, actress Bridget Moynahan, at team owner Robert Kraft's home in Brookline, Mass. BOSTON â Actress Bridget Moynahan, former girlfriend of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, is pregnant and Brady is the father, Moynahanâs publicist said Monday.

The glamorous pair split up late last year after a three-year relationship. Brady, a two-time Super Bowl MVP, has since been seen with lingerie model Gisele Bundchen, and media outlets have reported the two are dating.

A Dec. 15 statement from Moynahanâs publicist that said that Moynahan and Brady parted ways several weeks earlier.

On Monday, Moynahanâs publicist, Christina Papadopoulos, said in a statement to The Associated Press that the actress âis over three months pregnant. Former boyfriend Tom Brady is the father.â

âPrivacy and consideration is appreciated at this time,â the statement said. âNo further comments will be made.â

News of the pregnancy was first reported by the New York Post on Sunday. The Post quoted Papadopoulos as saying the actress was feeling âhealthy and excited.â

Messages left by The Associated Press with Bradyâs agent, Donald Yee, were not returned Monday.

Patriots spokesman Stacey James told the AP, âI think it would be inappropriate to comment.â

Moynahan, 35, has appeared in films such as âCoyote Ugly,â âI, Robotâ and the ABC television series âSix Degrees.â She grew up in Longmeadow, Mass.

Brady, 29, who has led the Patriots to three NFL titles, was named one of People magazineâs â50 Most Beautiful Peopleâ in 2002.

 Manufactured Liberal Outrage: Obamaâs Baby Mama Trackbacks/Pingbacks Pages Live Traffic The Code The Author Ye Olde Adverts Categories Calendar Favorite Posts Meta Swag My Host Todayâs liberal freakout: Salon: Fox News calls Michelle Obama âObamaâs baby mamaâ An alert reader wrote in just a little while ago to let us know about something heâd spotted on Fox News Wednesday afternoon. During a segment discussing conservative attacks against Michelle Obama, the wife of presumptive Democratic nominee Barack Obama, the network described the former as âObamaâs baby mama.â Theyâve even got screenshots and video. Oooooh! In full, it says âOUTRAGED LIBERALS: STOP PICKING ON OBAMAâS BABY MAMA!â It was featured in the bottom news scroller.  Well, if Obama and his little America hating mama want to be all hip and fist bumpâ¦â¦ Not to self: stop reading the quote, hard to finish post when ROTFLOL. Oliver Willis (who finally has a better header graphic), is in complete freakout mode: Hey Fox News, Just Call Her A N***** And Be Done With It, Okay? According to some white guy atÂ Shakesville, this is racist. Tomorrow, I assume Fox will put up a graphic, âObama downs a 40 of malt liquor, and shoots cop in drive-by.â Yawn.Â  Itâs an irony alert at Pandagon, who feature an Obama monkey doll, probably made by liberals. Check the header: there is an Obama logo, and next to it a caption that says âItâsÂ a jungle out there.â I find that highly offensive and racists! BTW, the post of the Pandagon post is âWatch Out For That Tree.â  Doesnât that seem racist? Or, am I reading too much in to it? And the freakout could continue on and on. See more at Memeorandum. Michelle Malkin, who was on Fox News during the time the scroll bar featured the current liberal manufactured outrage, points out that it was Michelle Obama herself who referred to BhO as her âbabies daddy,â and has used it many times. Those lovely progressive have gone on to send Michelle all sorts of *SURPRISE* hatefull, racist emails! Is there any point in checking the Interwebz and posting a few of the disgusting and hateful things that have been printed and published about W, Laura B., Darth Cheney, etc? How about just one, as most of yâall already have heard it all: âThe presidency of George W. Bush has now devolved into a criminal conspiracyto cover the ass of George W. Bush,â Keith Olbermann began. And letâs not forget all the pleasant things at the Huffington Post, which is an official stringer for the AP, is considered a news source at Google and Yahoo News, and is featured in many mainstream newspapers. I swear, I did not read James Joynerâs post at Outside The Beltway before writing this. He catches something else funny at Oliver WIllisâ. More: Sister Toldjah writes: The far left is in the midst of having a coronary. Indeed! Wake Up America: There is massive outrage rippling across the Internet right nowâ¦ The good news is, they will find some other massive freakout tomorrow. This is rich: The Mahablog decries the use of slurs, yet titles the post Who Needs Satire When Youâve Got Wingnuts?, and then goes on to slur Michelle M. by calling her Little Lulu. In the first showing of Little Lulu, she was throwing banana peels in a wedding aisle. Is Mahablog calling Michele M. a monkey? The Moderate Voice sureÂ reads like anything but a moderate, though certainly less unhinged then other progressives. The Leather Penguin picks up on the latest Excitable âIâm THE Conservative, damnitall!ââ Andy freakout on this MLOA (Manufactured Liberal Outrage Alert) A thought: If the term âbaby mamaâ denotes illegitimacy, then why did Michelle Obama use it? Did she mean that her kids are illegitimate?

 Itâs not outrage, dear. Itâs laughter. That Michelle Malkin video with âObamaâs Baby Mamaâ scrolling under it is pure self-satire. We liberals are getting a good chuckle out of it. You wingnuts have no sense of humor. No maha, dear, itâs all about outrage at Ollieâs place. I read all of the post and comments at Oliver Willisâ site todayâ¦and if you think all you liberals are full of chuckles, satire, and humor over this, you must be carrying around some mice in your pocket. Wasnât Michelle Malkin the one who got upset over a scarf in a Dunkinâ Donuts ad?  Seriously â you canât make this stuff up. Yâall sure arenât showing the humor today, maha, you have to admit that. That one at Olliverâs spot blew my mind. That was extreme, even for him. And that has what to do with the price of beer, Silke? Malkin didnât do it. She had nothing to do with the scroller. Malkin manufactures outrage about a scarf and you see nothing wrong with it.  Itâs only when the Left does it that you comment.  Interesting. But Obama bin Laden said that babies are a problem for his daughters? And Michelle is supposed to be a black Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy? Who are these lunes? Why donât we ask Malkin to check with Heraldo? Sorry, the comment form is closed at this time.

Closing the Curtain on the Baby Mama Daddy Drama Syndrome  


				  Eric Legette

Jamestown, NC (BlackNews.com) - False allegations of abuse or neglect, legal fees, family court cases, investigations from child welfare, domestic violence - all these things and much more are the consequences of the âdramaâ that is presently affecting countless numbers of separated and divorced fathers and mothers.  For single people, having sex too soon, ignoring warning signals and failing to have a plan in dating can quickly usher single people into the âdramaâ community. 
 For over a decade, Eric Legette, President/Founder of Fathers With Voices has assisted countless numbers of primarily separated and divorced fathers impacted by the drama.  His own experiences within and outside of family court as he advocated for the right to remain in his daughtersâ life led him to write Closing the Curtain on Baby Mama Drama: A Guide For Fathers Fighting For Their Children Inside and Outside of Family Court (Barnes and Noble.com).  The book offers valuable information and insight on issues that poses a direct threat to relationships between fathers and their children after a separation and divorce.  Mr. Legette provides insight for fathers on such issues as:


* The importance of educating yourself in family law
* Coping mechanisms to deal with the stress
* Ten examples of âBaby Mama Dramaâ and the solutions
* The reasons men should fight for their children

 Based on conversations Mr. Legette had with both fathers and mothers impacted by the âdramaâ, he learned that single people are also at risk of becoming part of this significant social phenomenon which ultimately led to the writing of the e-book The Singles Guide: How to Avoid Baby Mama-Daddy Drama Relationships (www.fatherswithvoices.info).


Within this book he is providing for single people an up close view on the damaging affects the drama has on individuals financially, legally and emotionally.  He is also informing single people of the same mistakes parents within the drama have made, they too maybe making the same mistakes as they are seeking a mate.  Mr. Legette provides insight on:


* Defining the Drama
* How to conduct a dating interview (To avoid becoming part of the drama)
* What is BMDDS (Baby Mama-Daddy Syndrome) and how does it affect your dating decisions?
* The four high risk forms of dating


Both books are designed to address and provide effective ways to confront and avoid this horrific social problem that is negatively impacting the lives of so many people today.  Mr. Legette truly believes the power of the drama is not so powerful that the curtains cannot at some point be closed!

Jamestown, NC (BlackNews.com) - False allegations of abuse or neglect, legal fees, family court cases, investigations from child welfare, domestic violence - all these things and much more are the consequences of the âdramaâ that is presently affecting countless numbers of separated and divorced fathers and mothers.  For single people, having sex too soon, ignoring warning signals and failing to have a plan in dating can quickly usher single people into the âdramaâ community. 
 For over a decade, Eric Legette, President/Founder of Fathers With Voices has assisted countless numbers of primarily separated and divorced fathers impacted by the drama.  His own experiences within and outside of family court as he advocated for the right to remain in his daughtersâ life led him to write Closing the Curtain on Baby Mama Drama: A Guide For Fathers Fighting For Their Children Inside and Outside of Family Court (Barnes and Noble.com).  The book offers valuable information and insight on issues that poses a direct threat to relationships between fathers and their children after a separation and divorce.

  Urlacher Baby Mama Drama Continues Other Interesting Stories send a tip Newsletter Istaverse contribute About all our citiesone convenient app The Joliet Herald-News reports this morning that Brian Urlacher's baby mama, Tyra Robertson, has filed a claim in Will County court that states that Urlacher's son, Kennedy, has taken to wearing pink diapers and wearing blue nail polish on his toes.  We're not sure exactly where in the penal code this counts as child abuse, but it gets better - Robertson seems to believe that this is reason enough to keep Brian from seeing his kid.  Can someone get Jeffrey Leving on the phone?  Brian needs some Father's Rights representation, stat. Robertson and Urlacher's lawyers have been wrangling back and forth to keep little Kennedy's visitation for Brian, and Robertson's lawyer said that Tyra "would allow the visitation, so long as Urlacher put away the Bears-blue nail polish and diapered their son in gender appropriate pull-ups."   If the story is indeed true - and the presence of a photo of painted nails on the Sun-Times site indicates it is - we'd like to take back all the negative things we've ever said about Brian Urlacher.  If he wants to teach his kid that there are no such thing as gender roles, then more power to him.  As long as none of it is actually hurting the child, then who gives a shit if he puts on nail polish and pink diapers?  (Although it might have been a slightly better idea to alternate with blue and orange, Brian.  Just a thought.) If Kennedy Urlacher was Brian's daughter instead of his son, would we be hearing stories about camouflaged diapers and playing with GI Joes?  If Urlacher's daughter started cover-2 plays as a defensive end at the local playlot, would there be legal paperwork filed about that?  We doubt it. Go get 'em, Kennedy.  Wear whatever you want.  Be a creative little 3-year-old.  The world will pummel it out of you eventually, so live a little bit when you're young.  When you're a sophomore in high school and everyone expects you to be kicking ass on the Junior Varisty team, you'll look back on this freedom and be glad your dad let you have a little fun.  We've got your back.  Just don't turn into a spoiled little brat later on because your dad let you get away with a few things.  And hang onto this link, just in case.  Got it?

Food for thought(kinda sorta) Call HamptonRoads.com & PilotOnline.com How to be civil in comments: So the other week the rumor swirled that Erykah Badu was pregs with her third childÂ by her new love Jay Electronica (who, I have to admit, is totally benefitng from this attention).Â In the next e-breaths everybody was like, 'Sheesh -- that's three babies by three different guys.' (Badu has a boy, with Andre 3000 and a girl with The D.O.C.) As much as I love Badu, I did ask myself. 'I mean, has she heard of birth control?' What kind of role model is she to young girls? After mentallyÂ wagging my fingers and getting sanctimonious and judgemental though I thought, 'Wait,Â why did you assume it was an accident? What if she wanted it that way? And anyway, what does her birth canal have to do with me?' Artists, as we know, have unorthodox ways of looking at things. So Badu, apparently having heard all the furor about her very busy womb, has shot back online. You can read the full rant here, but here are some of the highlights: peace,
HOW DARE YOU DISRESPECT THE QUEENDOM 
...AND MY CHILDREN AND MY INTELLIGENCE... i am a great mother and care giver to my 2 children and to this world .
I home schooled them and taught them the ways of good to the best of my ability.
i am their doctor and their nurse .
and even sometimes their mother and their father. i am an excellent mother...I PUT MUCH TIME AND THOUGHT INTO HAVING AND RAISING MY CHILDREN. 
IVE HAD THE HONORS OF HAVING 2 HOME BIRTHS AND 2 WONDERFUL PARTNERS BY MY SIDE. every relationship i have been in was because i loved the person DEARLY and was dedicated to us "exclusively" FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. the fathers of my children are my brothers and friends . we have a great deal of respect for one another and always will. WE LOVE OUR CHILDREN TO NO END. 
we took our own "vows" and CONTINUE TO UPHOLD THEM.
AND THAT IS WHAT THAT IS . question?
WHAT IS MARRIAGE ? 
WHO IS THE JUDGE? WOULD IT "LOOK BETTER " TO MARRY AND DIVIORCE AND MARRY AGAIN ? WOULD THAT BE MORALLY CORRECT ? WHATS THE DIFFERENCE ? the government's involvement i guess. IDEALLY , IT WOULD BE EXCELLENT TO FIND THE MAN OR WOMAN WHO FULFILLS YOUR SPIRIT AND STAY FOR EVER AND EVER ( thru sickness and health till death do us part ) AND HAVE HEALTHY STRONG CHILDREN AS A RESULT OF A HEALTHY AND STRONG UNION. (this CAN happen ... we need much training , however.) OR  IS IT REALLY "GOOD" TO STAY IN A RELATIONSHIP WHERE BOTH PARTIES ARE UNFULFILLED , LONGING FOR RELIEF , BRINGING one another down as a result of improper training , creating BAD ENERGY AND EXPERIENCES FOR THE CHILD TO REPEAT ?
(not to mention breeding deceit and anger and resentment ) SEEMS TO CREATE FEARFUL CHILDREN WHO TURN INTO FEARFUL ADULTS . HOW MANY OF YOU GREW UP IN 2 PARENT HOMES THAT WERE MISERABLE... HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE A SIBLING THAT HAS A DIFFERENT FATHER OR MOTHER? DOES HE OR SHE MEAN LESS TO YOU? HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE MORE THAN 1 MOTHER OR FATHER OF YOUR OWN CHILDren ? how about this: I PRAY WITH MY CHILDREN I FEED THEM GOOD FOOD THEY RESPECT PEOPLES DIFFERENCES THEY TRAVEL THE WORLD WITH ME THE KNOW WHO THEY ARE THEY ADORE THEIR FATHERS AND ARE LOVED BY 2 PARENTS OR MORE - OR TWO OR MORE SETS OF LOVING GRANDPARENTS THEY CRY THEY GET HURT THEY GET SICK THEY HEAL THEY ARE real THEY ARE NOT AN IDEA or a TOPIC AND NEITHER AM I . I AM ALIVE . I AM BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. I AM A GOOD WOMAM. I AM GROWING I AM COMPLETE WITH OR WITHOUT A PARTNER AND WILL ALWAYS BE AND I HAVE DREAMS OF A FAMILY STRUCTURE ALL OF MY DREAMS DO NOT COME TRUE WE ARE THEIR CHAMPIONS . live how you want . follow which ever pattern YOU like . MY CHILDREN WILL BE LEADERS and they will not ever be slaves to this society's failing idea of morality. THEY OWN THEIR MINDS AND THEIR DREAMS. your opinions lack experience and are not only careless but also very uninformed and immature. if i lose you as a fan because i want to continue to have children thenÂ  WHO NEEDS YOU ....CERTAINLY NOT ME ... KICK ROCKS ... CALL TYRONE ... PACK LIGHT .... BITE ME and if this post is not clear kiss my placenta. * So I guess she's pregnant then, huh? But I'm sorry, this line from Idolator is too funny: ...spectacular rant that invites anyone who would like to further question her to kiss her placenta after, presumably, forming a line to the left and waiting for a while. Anyway, thoughts? Bad role model or just sign of the times? Please enable JavaScript to see comments. Don't get me wrong I am truly an EB fan.  She is one of my favorites.  When I first read on one of the gossip websites that she was expecting, by a 3rd father, the undercover conservative in me took pause (oh no she didn't, lol).  After reflecting, I came to the conclusion that she is who she is...a free spirit who lives her life, loves her life and and all of the forces that are in play in her life.
ALL of us have taken actions that may have caused others to do a double take...However, who are we to judge??? Besides, we don't know her LIKE THAT!! I was glad to see her post, as hilarious as it was in parts. She makes some very very very ...very very valid points,lol. She better call Tyrone  ohnotheydidnt  Oh no they didn't!The celebrities areÂ disposable. TheÂ gossip isÂ priceless.

Really? Archived Entry 63 Responses to âLogic: So, did 50 Cent burn his house down and try to kill his ex? Really?â Leave a Reply Fri 30 May 2008 Up until now, this ongoing legal battle between 50 Cent and his sonâs mother Shaniqua Tompkins has been shocking, if not entertaining, and distasteful. She sued him for $50k a month, up from the $25k she was getting. Instead a judge awarded her $6700 a month, and told her to leave 50âs $1.4 million Long Island mansion. Along with 50âs son Marquise, Tompkins also has a teenage daughter as well as a live-in boyfriend. But the judgeâs order has not made for a smooth relocation, more litigation has been set into motion, eviction deadlines loom, and, of course, a war of words has been aired out in the media.  But when kids are caught up in a burning house, and fire marshalls suspect arsonâ¦this whole family dispute is no longer the slightest bit salacious or juicy. Iâm noticing alot of interesting allegations, some anonymous, showing up on TMZ. Including, a disturbing rant by Shaniqua Thompkins herself, claiming, âYes  think he would, heâs obsessed. If he canât have me than no one can. Heâs obsessedâ¦.yes, weâre in litigation, weâre fighting over the house. [50] said he was gonna have someone come kill me and watch what he does. And this is what he did. [So he threatened you?] Yes!â (Click here to watch the video) On Monday, a cameraphone caught 50 Cent and Tompkins making a scene outside of a lawyers office in Long Island, after a deposition session. They were seen yelling at each other in the street. 50 is physically urged into his truck. Meanwhile, Shaniquaâs boyfriend stands and watches with his friends. What could they have been yelling about? Perhaps something ugly had just taken placeâ¦.  An âsourceâ claimed to TMZ that 50âs crew trashed Shaniquaâs lawyers office on Monday. Would that be at the time of this deposition and public spectacle? Hmmâ¦Maybe it has something to do with thisâ¦ From the Associated Press: Tompkinsâ lawyer, Paul Catsandonis, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that the dispute over the house had become âextremely, extremely contentiousâ in recent days. Although he declined to be specific, he said there was an âextremely dangerous incidentâ Monday in his Manhattan office while taking a deposition for the lawsuit. The dispute was âinvolving the parties in question,â he said. Shaniquaâs lawyer also told TMZ that before the firetrucks were called to the burning house at 5am today, Shaniqua heard someone entering her home at 3am. Scary! Wonder why police werenât called to investigate the break-in? And since the consensus around the snarkosphere has been that fif has gonâ crazy and tried to kill his baby mom, her new man, 2 children, 2 other innocent people, and burn up his own houseâ¦..I just have to sayâ¦as erratic and irrational as rappers often areâ¦.I just dont know if I buy it. Click more to continue  If itâs about the house, the judge has already awarded the house to 50. He would be free to sell it in a month. Houses are usually worth less when delivered in ash. If 50 hired some mercenary to burn the house, I would think that his own son being subjected to smoke inhalationâ¦would be a dealbreaker. And as for the whole âif he canât have me, nobody canâ thingâ¦..umâ¦well, I guess. A statement from 50âs rep reads: âInformed this morning while filming a new motion picture on location in Louisiana, Curtis Jackson expressed deep concern over this fire at his property. He is extremely thankful that everyone including his son, Marquise, escaped the burning house safely. He is confident that authorities will be conducting a thorough investigation of the incident and is eager to review their findings.â Here is the APâs description of the scene at the fireâ¦. Police said the victims included the rapperâs former girlfriend Shaniqua Tompkins and two of her children, including a son fathered by 50 Cent named Marquise. Three other adults in the home werenât immediately identified. A passing off-duty police officer helped rescue the six people off an elevated deck in the homeâs backyard, Feld said. Why would 4 adults all rush with 2 kids in tow, to a porch instead of out a door? I guess the layout of the house is key in making sense of this, but they must have all been coming from different parts of the house, so why would everyone end up there?  Damn. I wouldnât have thought fif would have harmed his son. So I dont think he had nothin to do with it. Reply this trick really thinks she is cuteâ¦.if he canât have her no one else will !!!! please you are obsessed with his money and mad that he wonât give you any. i believe her boyfriend kand her planned this fire. he was not in the house at the time. it was reported she had to be out by tomorrow. so what other gift would she give 50â¦.i donât believe 50 had any thing to do with thisâ¦.now if his son was not in the house during that time i may have considered maybe, but he wonât not put his sonâs life in jeopardy. she knew she was losing and was angry. she is trying to make it seem like he wanted to kill her, ok he may have said it in anger , we all have at one time or other, but he has too much to lose behing this trickâ¦.enought saidâ¦..oh am i FIRST!!?? Reply 50 really has no motive to burn down the house since they were ordered to leave by the end of the school year (june). Also, that whole breakin part sounds very fishy since nothing is mentioned about police coming to check it out. As for killing her, I doubt he would have that done. He wouldnât risk his whole life and freedom to kill somebody who he already has such an upper hand on. Also, 50 is (or has been) hesitant to even talk shit about her for fear of his son holding it against him so I seriously doubt he would go as far as to kill her. Iâm not saying he didnât say it(because people say shit in anger all the time that they donât mean), but I think its clear to see he wouldnât do it. Reply RUN CIARA RUN Reply This whole thing is fishy on some Left-Eye type shit. I dunno Info. I donât believe Fif would burn down a house with this son in it and all.  That girl is lying; either she did that shit, or she got someone to do it themselves. This is worse than that whole Dame Dash baby mama drama thatâs been going on for as long as I can remember. Reply I think the baby mama did cuz she cant live there any more. why would fif burn his own crib he was getting it back anyway. Reply I think this might be a setupâ¦ Iâm not a big 50 fan, but I truly believe the dude is too smart to try and throw his life (and millions) and child away over some bs with his baby mamaâ¦ Just like u said, if she thought someone was tryin to break into her house at 3am why didnât she call the policeâ¦ especially after he allegedly threatened her life. Plus the way she is jumpin all over the news sayin he did it is just a lil too âLady doth protest too muchâ for meâ¦ ONly thing Iâll give her is that 50 does seem arrogant enough to where I could see him thinkin he could do some shit like that and get away with itâ¦ Either way Iâm almost sure this wasnât an accidentâ¦ Reply Is there any doubt Shanâs birdbrain azz did this? I hope 50 can get full custody of his son after she has clearly endangered him with this nonsense. The sane train has quite clearly pulled out the station and left Shanâs bird azz behind. Reply Oh and I gotta addâ¦.Shan so played herself with that whole, fif said if I cant have you nobody can BS.  I doubt fif EVER said that ish to her. Puhleeze. She is definitely in meltdown mode. Chick is dangerous for sure. Reply *yawn* number 57â¦. Reply Info, i dont know who to beleive. As a huge fif fan, iâm remaining objective. fif does most things to perfection. so it wouldnt be far fetched if blueprints of the house and many steps were in place to make sure the house burned and everyone remain unscathed. thats what professionals are hired for. him being in louisiana doesnt mean anything. unfortunately his ex-girl doesnt have the polish or class to keep her statements to a minimum. so it makes her look suspect as well. but whomever is found to be responsible needs jailtime. whatever issues adults have, it SHOULD NEVER BE AT THE EXPENSE OF KIDS! Reply I am a fan of Fifs, but keeping that out of this I just dont think he is stupid like that to do this?  First, he is one of the richest rappers period, would he put all that at risk by doing this?  Not only the arson, but it could have killed someone.  Then not to mention, no matter how he feels about her, his son lives at the house, and their is no well maybe he did this and thought his son wasnt home, bullshit, his son lives their and this shit happend real early in the morning, so the kid was their.  So would FIf do that?  Please.  Not to mention he is winning in court, she has to leave the crib, so why would he burn it down?  And she acting like she is some knockout and shit, she is busted, aint nobody want her broke down ass, only reason them dudes is fucking with her is cause they get to live in Fifs house.  I wouldnt be surprised if she did this to the house, like If i cant live their, you gonna kick me out, I burn this bitch like Left Eye, after the fight they had, she could sell it like Fif is crazy and tried to kill her, maybe setting up some way Fif has to give her money, they are homeless now.  Then she running to all the news shit blaming Fif for this, I think she is bullshit.  So if someone broke in the house an hour before the fire, what the fuck?  And you didnt call the cops.  Funny everyone is safe though right?  Either her, or one of them dudes or their boys set that shit up, without a doubt.  Fucking bird brain bitch. Reply 1.If someone brakes into my crib or temporary in her case i donât go back to sleep like nothing i call po po. 2.Why would fif burn a crib with his son inside if he was ever got serious about killing her i sure he would make sure his seed wasnât home. I smell some Lisa Lopes shit. Reply they havenât arrested that bitch yet????? 50 is too smart to do something so dumb like that. 50 did not get where he at by being stupid, Shaniqua know she set that house on fire and i hope she is arrested for it Reply have u seen marquises myspace he got it made iphones chains money 50 spoils that kid its just that woman damn choose better next time Reply who read this shit?who the fuck?come on yall actin like fucki paparazzi out there.
PLEASE!act like humans!dude too rich for that type of BS.
miss info ur smile is ridiculous.holler at ya french boy.. Reply Miss Info is your one stop hip hop pitstop! Reply got this from another site..
Disgruntled men put their children in harms way all the time. And if thatâs the argument against 50 setting the fire, why would she put her TWO children in harmâs way? Itâs amazing how many cases go through the family court system where the guy tells his ex, âIâll burn the house down.â  The thing about six people being in the house is this: Shaniqua would have to either be in cahoots with the other adults in the house and thereby be at risk of someone turning stateâs evidence against her and getting caught OR she would be acting alone and risking the lives of five other people, not to mention one of the other people catching her sloshing gasoline or whatever around the house before the fire was set. If she set the house on fire and the other five didnât get out, she has five murder charges hanging on her head along with arson charges.
The six occupants of the house were rescued from an upper deck, if I heard correctly. Why would you set a house on fire and go UPSTAIRS? Harder to get out if youâre upstairs.
The said she heard someone come in and yet TMZ took the liberty of twisting her words into âsomeone broke in.â If there were six people in the house and she heard someone come in, she probably wouldnât call 911 because she thought it was someone who was supposed to be there. Duh. And i have to agree.. Just b/c he rich and alot to lose, doesnât mean he didnât.. rich people do stupid ish everyday. Reply @whoaintâ¦.hmmm good points! It would take a lot of trust to get the other adults in lineâ¦.unless there was alot of money promised? But if the baby moms didnt mean to insinuate that a break-in took place then why did her lawyer even leak that lil tidbit to TMZ?
I think from the photos that the porch was raised but no necessarily on an upstairs floorâ¦.as in, the house seemed set on some kind of hill or uneven land, so the porch may have been main floor but still elevated from the outside landscaping? honestly Iâm totally confused about the whole thingâ¦.but thanks for the insight! Reply @whoaint Most of these disgruntled men arenât 8 figure niggas who is actually getting the better of the child support situation. Not only that, but she was going to be out the house in June anyway. Maybe if she won the case and got to keep the house there would be more of a motive, but that bitch was on her way out. He has absolutely nothing to gain by this and everything to lose. If 50 gonna burn anybodies house down its going to be Ja or Irvâs. Reply let me find out this was an accident.perhaps someone forgot to put out a ciggarette/blunt and the curtains that are made out of egyptian silk(lol)caught on fire which quickly spread to the other rooms in the house and now this greedy worthless bitch running around talking bout âmy babyfather tried to kill me and our sonâ now if thats the case she should go to jail for making false accusations. sheâs out there talking crazy.somebody tame that beast.please. Reply FiF aint burn that house down, that broad crazy, she pissed that she got to get ghost and move. Reply HOLD UP IN THAT VIDEO OF THEM YELLING IN THE STREET DOES SHE REALLY SAY âYEAH RUN RUNâAS HEâS BEING FORCEFULLY PULLED AWAY?THATS A CLEAR SIGN OF A HOODRAT.NOW SHE,ME AND YOU BOTH KNOW IF HIS PEOPLE WERENâT LOOKING OUT FOR HIS BEST INTERESTS HE WOULDâVE PUT HER DOME TO THE CONCRETE.LMAO. Reply Well she may have been in the house to stay.. The day before the fire, her attorney is claiming a email was produced that would prove his orginal plan was to give her and his son the house. So i guess thatâs why she would scream He did it. Plus he threatened her on Monday. Reply and..
@What it do
We also never had a NFL players wife and male companion died on their porch before OJ..
Iâm not saying he did itâ¦ but when everyone is like âhe would never,etcâ
we donât know what that man is capable of. And when emotions are involved people will do crazy things. And heâs known not to handle conflict well. I just have alot of questions and like to look at all sides. Reply Iâm not buying he did this oneâ¦ She knew she was going to get the boot by court order soon and pulled this stuntâ¦. And once we find out where the fire started at we will know for sure that she did itâ¦ On another note why would dude threaten his son life like that? He had no way of knowing where the kid was going to be in the house or how it would spread. 50 a shady dude but I aint buying him for this oneâ¦ She mad, her peoples was trying to beat 50 up after court and now thisâ¦.  But the deal breaker for me is the âIf he canât have me no one canâ part lol Thats funny on so many levels and sort of make her look like a fool. The not being happy with 25k a month and a house part kind of makes her looks BAD and capable of acting out of hate and greedâ¦ But on a serious note why canât G-Unit release an album without all types of drama killing the momentum? They have to know this is not helping the brandâ¦ Reply @whoaint Good points butâ¦She would of been out by June _ 2008 ,Even though she had other people in the house she could of been a fit of rage like â fcuk it ill burn this bitxh up â and the other adults in the house were like â na chill chill â in the middle of everything the small fire she started in said area/room is now out of control and now a story has to be made up to cover up the sittuation .She heard someone come into the house hmmm so shes saying 50 gave whoever keyes to kill her or she always keeps her doors/windows open .Ask Busta what he had to go through with his baby moms ill leave it at that . Reply However I donât want to take any sides.  You could look at several things here someone could be trying to frame FIDDY. Did you all see the fighting in the middle street? Shan was running up to 50 trying to provoke him and his people was trying to get him in the vehicle. She was yelling and acting like a damn fool in those street. Fiddy acting a fool too. Who knows Fiddy better, Shan and she knows how to push his button to make him go off. That is the perfect time in public where everyone can see FIDDY loose his COOL. Another scenario even though Fiddy had everything going in his favor. Shan said they had proof, email proof that indicates FIDDY says she could have the house which could backfire on Fiddy. Reply @ Whoaintstupid âKnown not to handle conflict wellâ? Every time somebody pisses him off the worst he does is make music about them.  Its easy to say he would never do it when there is no motivation. She was leaving in June, the house was going to be his again, his own son was in the house, and he was getting the better of the case. He was already winning so he didnât need to do this. Reply @ Miss Info according to a report the off duty cop who rescued them says he directed them to a deck and they had to jump down to him. I also read that a judge recently granted her stay to remain in the house until after the litigation was settled which means she could remain in the house indefinitely.
I donât want to point fingers at anyone without hearing more information but I donât think she has a motive to burn the house down since she is asking for the home as part of the settlement in the breach of contract suit and she no longer had a deadline to leave.
Another point is without a place to live she is vulnerable in a custody suit. She had nothing to gain by burning down the house. Reply Also I just thought what if one of  the other adults came in from hanging out went to cook something and left the stove on and fell asleep happens all the time  and what happend to the smoke alarms ? Reply @WhoaintStupid
I read about the e-mail where she was promised the house and the lawyer is claiming 50 signed something promising her half his earnings. If the e-mail and the contract where 50 agreed to give her half his earnings actually exist then she really had 50âs back against the wall. Reply missInfo as a mother if my children nearly die in a house fire i would be holding on to them for dear life thanking GOD for saving them life crying like hell.
i certainly would not leave my kids to come back to the house and talking to reporters. 50 cazy baby mama need to be lock up and 50 cent gets his son and stay away from her cause she really hates 50 cent and she will do anything to gets his money. Reply yall pointing the finger at the wrong person, it was the dancer who ciara fired who did it Reply Yo 50âs baby Momâs is crazy. 1. If 50 is the monster she claims he is why even ask him for money, youâd want to distant yourself from the said psycho. 2.If you know heâs capable of harming you why live in his house and ask for child support? 3. When 50 had his son she tried to go see his son she called cops on him why not give him visitation rights that keep him off the property. She is something else yo, If I wanted someoe out of my house, I wouldnât burn it down, iâd cut off electricity water e.t.c but burn down $1.5 Million property is foolish. I dnt believe nothing she says coz her character is visible from her actions sheâs obsessed with 50âs lifestyle & wants a cut and 50 is just tryin to get rid of her. Reply 50 burning down the house?  Thatâs inconsistent with his character.  Think about it: 1. Didnât he recently give Willy Northpole (or some other C list artist) the boot for âallegedlyâ selling drugs out of his CT mansion? 2. This is a man who said he didnât want to beef with his baby mama because he didnât want his son to resent him.   3. Remember when she stabbed him up?  lol.  He didnât flip on her for that.   4. Dre/M&M were surprised at how level headed he was when they first sat down and spoke.   5. He was willing to give her MORE money than she asked for until the judge deaded that. Now Iâm not saying heâs not ruthless because, obviously, he can be.  But to do dumb sh1t like this?  Especially when she was getting the boot in 30 days?  Putting his son, career, money and life at risk?  Out of character. Now if he told his goonies to just handle it (without wanting to know the details) and they fukced it up, thatâs another story. And lol @ these comments from the allhiphop.com article: âYadadamean said:

Plus the fact that sheâs runnin all over the place screamin that he did it is just a lil too convenient for meâ¦ Sheâs obviously a bird, cause if she was smart or had smart people around her she would know that publicly accusing someone of a crime without proof or evidence or witnesses is grounds for a slander case (not like heâll get anything outta it, but it would put his G-unit smeakers in her face for good measure). Reply WhoaintStupid got some GOOD POINTS! Her attys office WAS trashed by G-Unit peeps for SOME REASON!? She just may have been gettinâ that house, we donât know. The lawyerâs SMUTT tho, WHY da FIDDUCK is he talking to TMZ??? Fif need to watch his âpeepsâ tho. Niggaz more jealous than bitches nowadays over their niggas. One of fifs peeps may have called himself âHELPING his MANzâ & took thangs into his own hands or some crazy âSTANâ couldve did it! We donât know shyt! The WORLD knows they got problems! ALSO, Iâve heard TOO many Baby Mommas myself threaten baby daddys to kill their kids cuz they couldnât have their way! This chick aint NO DIFFERENT than the hoodyratts I know! (I KNEW that hoe was dumb when she showed up in court with tight booty jeans & a low cutt tee! NO CLASS!) Anywhoo, Iâve also seen niggaz get overly emotional & threaten baby mamas, too. But Fif aint no RN (regular nigga) like the ones Iâve seen do that tho. Moral is: âTHOU SHALT NOT BE EMOTIONALLY RULEDâ, period! NUFF SAID! Reply u never see nas and carmen doin no shit like this Reply JIMMY HENCHMEN DID IT
                   !!!!!!!!! Reply 50 is no saintâ¦but I doubt he did this.  Now, why the hell he couldnât put his pride aside and just leave this dumb woman in that house.  1.5 Million is not that much money in 50 terms, and he would have avoided all this agravation. If only for his kid.   I doubt that this woman is deserving, but his son is needs a good place to live and less drama.  All which would be less if he had allowed her to remain in the house.  Poor kid we donât choose who our parents are. Reply yo  fif ainât stupid,he a P.I.M.P he ainât gonna risk erything over some ugly dumb ass broad. Reply I got MADD LOVE for 50, BUT from what Iâve gathered, there was NO PROBLEM with ratty Baby Moms stayin in that house UNTIL she gotta new man to keep her company! 50 still loves her (to a degree) & OBVIOUSLY wants to control her & has shown us that he gets very upset when he cannot do so. He publicly stated he hasnât had a real girlfriend SINCE her, but suddenly SHE has a man, in his house! Do U REALLY think 50 can handle that well? The man couldnât handle Kanye outselling him! Iâll bet when he first gave her that house it wasnât made clear it was ONLY based on her remaining a single old maid. He just thought (âKNEWâ) she was gonna live that lonely life under his support 4 ever=STRATEGIC GENEROSITY & OPRESSION. (Just like Irv Gotti said to Deb-âAint nobody gonna want youâ¦.â etc) Well, no matter HOW ignorant she is, her side should be heard openly (& filtered) as well. Donât say rich baby daddies/husbands wonât kill thoâ¦..Ray Caruth, Robert Blake, OJ Simpson, Chris Benoitâ¦. So WHO KNOWS??!! Reply 50 didnt do that. Her crazy a** did that. She a gold digger and why didnt she buy her own house when he was giving her $50,000 a month for child support. Then she could have as many men as she want to come live with her.  By the way she act you can tell she a hoodrat. Even before all this happened 50 said she hasnt let him see his son since april. He need to get custody.  And as for her thinking he want her, why would he want her when he could mess with more intelligent women because it is obvious she is low class, look how she carries herself, yelling out in the street, talking about heâs trying to kill her.  Hoe sit down! Reply @WHO AINTâ¦â¦in cases where men are just so crazy over their ex and they canât stand the thought of another man they usually donât have a six month delayed reaction to it. heâs asked the court long ago to evict her once the child support issue was settled, and went back to court on April 3rd and won the right to evict her because she is a squatter, he had won the case end of story. If he loved her so much to the point of obsession he would of married her at some point, or atleast taken her to one event,  and refer to her as his woman as some point, heâs been in the public eye for 5 years now and not once has he said they were together always referred to their relationship as a thing of the past, they may have had their private dealings on and off but if he were truly stressed out about her, wouldnât there have been some signs. In every interview iâve seen he claimed they never really got along and that she is money hungry  also the truth shouldnât change, you say tmz twisted her words by saying she said a break in, well a local reporter for news 12 spoke to a neighbor who arrived shortly after they escaped the fire and he quoted her as saying the same thing, also i notice in one article she said she was woke already because marquise was sick and in another she said she was awakened by the molotav cocktail flying thru the window. so were you up already or were you awakened, did someone break in or did someone throw something threw the window, she is not consistent  and instead of allowing police to investigate she more interested in holding press conferences with no evidence saying her sons father did it, which can be traumatizing for a 10 yr old to hear, and she keeps screaming that for the cameras  even if she as the mother believes 50 to be responsible it is irresponsible to go public with something that can be so devastating with a child she should assist police (in private interviews held at a station not usually in the street with reporters) and hope for a thorough investigation which would lead to an arrest of the guilty parties Reply we all know how babys fathers can get really posessive. Sometimes they think just because you had their child they own you. So her saying if he canât have her noone can have her is really not that far fetched. It has nothing to do with her looks. It has to do with his egocentric, arrogent ways especially because she had moved on and had her boyfriend living with her. Seems to me in his mind he probably feels he is being humiliated. Seems he is the one that needs to move on. Reply 50 cent baby mother is making a lots error in trying to set up 50 cent she didnât  speak to her lawyer before she start talking. part of the plan is to make everyone think itâs 50 cent that why she talking to reporters saying it 50 cent. but the law will catch her Reply Maybe the Game did itâ¦. Reply @dedee.
boyfriends are obsessed with girlfriends all the time doesnât matter he never married her. Itâs about control, he for once since he âmade it bigâ was losing control. And she may win. He said in a video when coming out the courtroom âOf course i won, i always doâ. So someone whoâs known for always winning and being in power.. how do u think they would react?? And different report alway surface.. that was reported she said someone came in at 4am. And going to see about your property, and having reporters stick a mic in your face is not a press conference. Of course she was hot, she thinks the father of her child is trying to kill her.  They both needed to be the bigger person in the past for the sake of their son, now he might loss one of them because they couldnât work past their differences Reply Okay Boyfriends are obsessed with girlfriends all the time right, but 1 fact yâall donât seem to get is  1. Shaniqua does not work.
2.She has 1 son out of wedlock with Fif and another daughter and a live in boyfriend.  Fif ainât responsible for supporting her daughter or boyfriend yet they live in his $1.4Mil mansion. 3. She limits the time 50 spends with his son which would frustrate any father, 50 does international tours e.t.c so he doesnât have enought time as it is to spend with his son. Visitation rights has been a problem right. 4. She knows she canât afford a 1.4 Mill mansion or continue to live the lifestyle she lives without Fif coz her new manâs a bum ya dig? Coz clearly he doesnât own any property heâs on some Kay Fed swag. 5. If someone told you to leave their house? Why would you stay? You ainât his wife so sheâs not entitled to the same rights as a ex-wife The legal system is to blame here, they should have evicted her, finalised the child support entitlement and conclude litigation before things get ugly coz it canât be healthy for the kids. Plus 50 wouldnât harm his son, Iâd be pissed if I had to support someone i donât love or care about. Reply 50 cent greedy baby mother have tried everything to make 50 cent look bad , take away his freedom and ruin his career.
and know she is calling him a bad dad which everyone knows how much 50 cent loves his son.
and the property is not hers as i am aware it belongs to 50 cent so she should have stayed and look after her kids any good mother would do.
and do not think herf bady father want to kill her else she would have report it just like how she report that he push her. Reply IF 50 DONâT STAY AWAY FROM HIS BM HIS LIFE WILL BE OVER BECAUSE SHE IS DOING EVERYTHING TO FINISH HIM OFF. THAT UGLY ASS BM OF  50 CENT REALLY HATES HIM AND SHE IS DISGRACEFUL. Reply Wow this is crazyâ¦  Im so sick and tired to people jumping on the womenâs backs when there is a problemâ¦  This chick is obviously crazyâ¦  @ who aint, y the hell would 50 bother with this womanâ¦  He is like the only man ever to be on the winning side of a child support battleâ¦  that chick is not any of all that and Im pretty sure 50 has knocked off mad celeb chicksâ¦  cut the bs manâ¦  This chick is a gold diggin wh0re and she mad that she cant get her wayâ¦  She has absoultely no evidence of anythingâ¦  and even if she did his lawyers is beastâ¦  a yr of probation for attempted murder, are you people realizing wats going on hereâ¦  Yo 50 is not a dickheadâ¦  And it is very obvious that he loves his son more than he hates that wh0re so cut it outâ¦  some people need to use there brain moreâ¦. Reply This dame is bonkers yo. She ainât got no skills besides gettin into 50âs pockets. And she ainât that good at that either.   How come none of this drama wasnât there before 50âs name came out on Forbes.  You know she be sitting around with her hood rat girlfriends talking about ,âThe man got mills, you carried his child you need to get some of that millions he be flauntin in the videos.â  If she ainât supposed to be living in 50âs house that means 50 can charge her rent and not have to pay child support coz sheâd be in arrears on rent.  50 needs a new legal team coz I dnât need to pass the bar exam to frustrate that crazy woman to vacate the property and give up custody. Reply come on this is common sense he had da house already why would he burn it down and then she quickly implicates himâman this bird has been trying to get in this dudes pockets for months and they all end up at the same place whether itâs on an upper floor or not they knew how to get outâthis shit is really stupid.  she was getting out the house come on man Reply contactmusci is reporting that 2 more house  burn down 1 hour before 50 cent own house burn and there maybe a link but fif son  mother was quick to point finger on him before the investigation finish. all fif cent hoodrat baby mother is cares about is getting her hand on fif money. she is screaming all over the place that fif should call her to speak to his son so that she can tell more lies on him, that him said him going to come finish the job of killing her. fif please stay away  FROM THAT WICK BABY MOTHER OF YOURS we all know that you LOVE YOUR SON very much. you have always take care of your son  her daughter that is not yours plus her and her family too. that ugly bit*h couldnât fif get anyone else OMG she is buck ugly Reply His baby mother is desperate.  50 was already giving her $50,000 a month in child support and paying all the household bills. She didnt have to pay nothing, she had it made, but she got greedy and wanted more money. 50 took her to court to get a set amount he could pay her because she was being overly greedy.  How many men do you know that files child support papers on themselves?  Go ahead Iâll waitâ¦NONE!! It just goes to show what type of man he is. And as far as her living up in his house rent and bill free and she got a dead beat man living up in there, thats disrespectful not only to the man that is taking care of you but also to your son. What kind of example is that to set for the kids?â¦all that is doing is teaching them to be irresponsible and to go live off of other people. I dont know anybody that wants to take care of their exâs boyfriend or girlfriend, that do not make someone âobsessedâ just because he didnt want her boyfriend and his homeboys living there. I agree with Anon, this is out of 50âs character.  I dont think he would risk all this hard work heâs done over the years to lose it all for a hoodrat and especially to hurt his son.  He already said that he started rapping because of his son that basically his son saved his life when he came along. Reply @ all u dumb ass bitches out there like rose, sharon & u r stupid, no way in hell would fif promise that dumb ass hood rat bitch half his fortune. 4 what? did she take half the shots, write half the rhymes? what has this bird really done 2 get half. i am also quite sure if he did promise her that none of this wouldâve happened because she would b 1 happy gold digging bitch.& 4 all u dumb fucks out there if I was in a similar position I wouldnât mind my baby moms having another man but go fuck him @ his house or a hotel not at the place I provide 4 my child & further more fif bought the house so his son can live comfortable & this hood rat bitch only in the picture because she had his son. HALF hahahahaha what a fucking joke. Reply @ u dumb ass super h8 i did not say anything bad about 50 cent so please read what i said ok and i will say it again 50 cent bm is wicked and ugly it seems as if 50 cent could not get any other woman to sleep with than her.
i was just praying she didnât use that  ugly face and crack my tv cause i would have find her and bust her ass.

Reply first off i dont 50 think 50 cent would do that one that was mike tyson old house so he put money in to that..two he son was in the house come now do you really think he would do that be for real..three he already had the house whne the judge awarded him the house..if you ask me his baby mother is angry and want money,,thats all its two it..and what the comment she mad..if he cant have me no one else can.bitch please if he wanted to im pretty sure he would of got back with you along time ago..shes just crazy ass girl..whos greedy for money..how abiut you get a job bitch and stop living on 50â¦she think oh i have hes baby no bitch all hd cares for his son ,,and if yiu ask me 50 need to get custody of his son..she crazy Reply This situation needs to be resolved immediately; I hope know one gets hurt.

 50 Cent Skips Son's High School Graduation, Gets BLASTED on Facebook 50 Cent: Pillow Talk Ain't No Contract 50 Cent Owns Shaniqua Tompkins 50 Cent: Shaniqua Tompkins Kidnapped Marquise 50 Cent Sort of Wins Custody Battle Shaniqua Tompkins Calls Shenanigans on 50 Cent Lawyer 50 Cent to Shaniqua Tompkins: You Got Served! Shaniqua Tompkins Sues Rapper, Wants More Than 50 Cents Follow Shaniqua Tompkins? Shaniqua Tompkins Biography Shaniqua Tompkins is the source of 50 Cent's baby mama drama. She is the mother of his son, Marquise. She also accused him of trying to... 
	The bizarre feud between 50 Cent and his son MarquiseÂ dates back to last year when Father of the Century candidate FiddyÂ unleashed a profane tirade against his then 16-year-old son. 
 Note to Shaniqua Tompkins: If 50 Cent makes you some nice promises after a good lay, don't hold him to it. At least not in a court of law. That's the basic gist of his latest legal action. 50 Cent is firing back at his baby mama after she filed a $50 million breach of contract suit. Did 50 Cent really try to burn down the house where Marquise - his 11-year-old son, resided? Did Marquise's mom kidnap him and hold him against 50's will? These questions remain very much unclear. Continuing to trade barbs, allegations and lawsuits with his estranged baby mama, 50 Cent says Shaniqua Tompkins is holding their son hostage. Fiddy and Shaniqua have been at each other's throats ever since that fire that destroyed the house the rapper bought for her and Marquise. Shaniqua Tompkins, step off! Rapper / human flak jacket 50 Cent got what he wanted in the latest chapter of his baby mama drama - kind of. A Long Island judge has granted him an unrestricted visit from August 3-12 with Marquise, his son with former girlfriend Shaniqua Tompkins. 50 Cent's baby mama Shaniqua Tompkins wants 50's lawyer off their case - because, according to her, that guy knows her legal strategy! According to TMZ, Shaniqua has huddled with 50 Cent's lawyer, Brett Kimmel, in the past - before the custody battle over their son, Marquise, began. 50 Cent's ex-baby mama, Shaniqua Tompkins, got a restraining order this morning against the rapper - then got served with a huge-ass lawsuit. Lawyers for 50 Cent took it to Shaniqua Tompkins, slapping her upside the head with a $20 million defamation suit in Connecticut court. Shaniqua Tomkins, 50 Cent's baby's mama, has filed a new lawsuit against the rapper. According to our bitter rival, Perez Hilton, she's accusing the rapper of "breach of contract and unjust enrichment." He supposedly broke a promise to give Tomkins and their son Marquise a house.

Comments (42) Badge nomination  Related Groups Please sign in Get Help Membership & Newsletters BabyCenter Shortcuts BabyCenter Mobile Our U.S. Sites Our International Sites A lot of people have asked me this question and I want to know your inputs. I'd rather be called "the mother of my child" or by my name. Me and my SD (Elijah's bio dad)Â are not together and we both have moved on so when someone is talking about me or when he refers to me, he always says "my baby mama". I don't get offended because that is what I am to him but I do HATE to be called "a baby mama" because I'm so much more than just a baby mama. I am my son's teacher, friend, provider, nurturer, entertainment at times, and his mother. NowÂ with DF he does NOT call me his BM...he calls me his GF, fiance, son's mother, his boo, his everything. I guess it depends on the relationship between the parents. IDK....some people think it's trashy to be called a baby mama. To me it sounds trashy/ghetto. What do you ladies think? ~*Brittany proud mommy of 2 busy lil men...Elijah (10-28-07) & Bryson (10-9-09)*~ I AM, CHELSEI'S MOTHER or EBONI. To me "baby mama/ baby daddy" is grammatically incorrect, therefore I don't even allow it to slip from my lips. It was coined to degrade people who were not married to other half that helped conceive their child. RIght on Eboni!!!!!!!!!!!!! That is SO true! ~Stephanie - Mama to Noah, Doula, Certified Lactation Counselor, Midwife, Registered Nurse, Childbirth Educator.

 I already said I didn't like the way it sounded, I am just trying to get to the bottom of why the negative connotation is attached to it. I think it applies to some women, and not in a good way, that is why I separate myself from it. I think we here feel that we are more than just an ex-girlfriend, and I know I am not a desparate gold digger. NEW SCREEN NAME: Mochamom9807 proud GO of several BBC groups for mocha mamas like me! proud mama of DS#1(98) and DS#2(07) Jusluvnmyboys- I feel you on that because I'm far from desperate or a gold digger. He don't have no gold ne way. LOL The mother of your child(ren), whom you did not marry and with whom you are not currently involved I think I agree with this one. Me and my Bd had a relationship to say the least but we're not involved now. He calls me his baby mama or ej mama. ~*Brittany proud mommy of 2 busy lil men...Elijah (10-28-07) & Bryson (10-9-09)*~ I don't like the term "baby momma" or "baby daddy".Â  Just cal me by my damn name lol!Â  or call me (insert childs name here)'s mother. I don't play dat s**t at all and he knows it. We are together and we have a soon to be 7 month old. Our first son passed. I told dude long ago dat I don't do that "baby momma" mess. It's derogatory and I don't call him my "baby daddy". That s**t is wack, for real. I agree I think its very disrespectful and I hate when my boyfriend says it. Its ridiculous cuz we go out!! It makes me feel horrible like thats allÂ  am is a baby mama. Guys just make me mad !! I like this board I think i'll join lol. Oh hell no. I don't like that name at all. He tried to call me that and i corrected his behind quick. I said I'm the mother of your child not your baby mama. I'm not your anything. I think the word is disrespectful. When i think about what it means and way BDs use,Â  I does not describe me or what i do. It stereotypes woman. I can't stand the word. Paquita, mommy toÂ my beautiful honeybunny. Have a blessed day!!

		Wednesday 17 February 2016  By Urmee Khan  12:18PM BST 13 Jun 2008  The news network referred to Mr Obama's wife Michelle as "Obama's baby mama", which is considered a derogatory term used for black single mothers.   It has been interpreted as a further racial slur on Mr Obama and the latest instance where the Right-wing network has disparaged the Obamas.   The graphic "Outraged liberals: Stop picking on Obama's baby mama" was flashed during an interview with a conservative columnist, Michelle Malkin, on Wednesday, about whether Mr Obama's wife had been the target of unfair criticism.   Bill Shine, senior vice president of programming at Fox, said in a statement that a producer "exercised poor judgment" during the segment.   In the last few days, E.D. Hill, a Fox anchor, has apologised for referring to an affectionate onstage fist bump shared by the couple as a ''terrorist fist jab,'' and Fox contributor Liz Trotta said she was sorry for joking about an Obama assassination after confusing him with al-Qa'eda leader Osama bin-Laden.  
Fox News presenter taken off air after Barack Obama 'terrorist fist jab' remark
  Ms Trotta said: "I sincerely regret it and apologise to anybody I've offended," she said. "It's a very colourful political season and many of us are making mistakes and saying things that we wish we hadn't said."   Karl Frisch, a spokesman for Media Matters, a liberal watchdog, said: "This is part of a broader problem with Fox: out of bound comments are followed by a half-baked apology. At some point Fox has got to decide if it is a responsible news source."   The Obama campaign have launched a website to dispel rumours about his faith and patriotism and his wife's views on race as he prepares to compete for the White House in November.   The new website denies the allegations Mrs Obama used the racially divisive term "whitey," and tackles false claims that Mr Obama is a secret Muslim, as some blogs and conservative commentators have claimed.

Questions and Answers Don't let drama ruin YOUR life! In our parents' day (assuming you're over the age of 25) couples seemed to have the same game plan: meet someone, date, fall in love, get married, have kids, become retirees and move to Boca Raton. In this day and age, it's not so cut and dried. With split-parent households becoming the norm, the modern gal has new scenarios to deal with: namely how to step into a split parent situation that existed before your new relationship with the father did. 
In many situations seemingly, the mother isn't going to be overly receptive. Nothing you do seems to be good enough, everything that comes out of their mouth seems to be venom that puts such a strain on you and your relationship. Don't let it bring you down!

Lasciate ogne speranza, voi châintrate Breathe a bad word about Michelle Obama and youâll be cast into the fiery bowels of hell, says Reverend Dick Durbin. Hereâs my hell-baiting Fox segment on Michelle earlier this afternoon.  Quick correction: In the segment, I mention Salon as having published criticism of Mrs. O. I meant Slate. Got my left-wing websites mixed up. My apologies and thanks to Alex Koppelman of Salon for pointing out the error.  Iâm sure Salon will make sure everyone knows that they arenât going to burn with the rest of us. *** Update: Salon is in high dudgeon over a caption that Fox ran during my segment referring to Michelle Obama as Obamaâs âbaby mama.â I did not write the caption and I was not aware of it when it ran (the Baltimore studio doesnât have a monitor). I donât know if the caption writer was making a lame attempt to be hip, clueless about the original etymology of the phrase, or both. But I do know that it was Michelle Obama herself who referred to Barack as her âbabyâs daddyâ and has used the phrase âbaby daddyâ to describe Barack while on the stump this year. Hereâs how she introduced him during his Senate victory speech on Nov. 2, 2004: MICHELLE OBAMA, WIFE OF BARACK OBAMA: My babyâs daddy Barack Obama. Yeah! BARACK OBAMA, SENATOR-ELECT, ILLINOIS: Thank you, Illinois. Thank you. Thank you, Illinois. I donât know about you but Iâm still fired up. I am fired up. Look at this crowd. Thank you, Illinois.  Let me begin by thanking all the people who have been involved in this effort from down state to upstate, city, suburb, from every community throughout the state. Let me say how grateful I am to all of you for the extraordinary privilege of standing here this evening. Let me thank, because I will forget later on, itâs a thankless task, let me thank right now the best political staff that has been put together in this state. They are wonderful. You know who you are. You guys have been outstanding. I appreciate all of you. Let me thank my pastor, Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr. (ph) of Trinity United Church of Christ, fellow Trinitarians out there. Let me thank all the elected officials who have stood by me through thick and through thin but most of all let me thank my family. I am so grateful to my nephew Aber (ph), my niece Leslie (ph), my mother-in-law Marian (ph), my brother-in-law Craig Robinson, his wonderful girlfriend Kelly (ph), my sister Maya (ph), my new niece Zuhayla (ph) right there, my brother-in-law Conrad and most of all, most of all, my two precious daughters Malia (ph) Obama and Sasha (ph) Obama and the biggest star in the Obama family until the two girls grow up the love of my life Michelle Obama, give it up for Michelle. Give it up. See here for a 2004 discussion of Obamaâs comments the day after she made them. Sample: Posted on Friday, November 05, 2004 â 03:19 pm:
Youâre right Cynique, he hasnât proved himself. Iâm just going by his demeanor thus far, as well as my intuitive feeling about himâand that is how I feel about his potential at this pointâI could see him as president. His wife has nothing to do with how I feel either, especially after her âmy babyâs daddyâ comment. She is a doll (physically), but that comment turned me off! Posted on Friday, November 05, 2004 â 04:32 pm:
Well, Iâm sure his wifeâs remark didnât turn off Obamaâs black constituency; it was kind of an inside joke. Yes, Obama is very charismatic but you sounded as if you wanted to prove a point by jocking him rather than John Edwards who has, after all, served 6 years in the senate. See, Moonsigns, that how you get in trouble on this sight. LOL Posted on Friday, November 05, 2004 â 04:55 pm:
OH FOR PITYâS SAKE Moonsigns, could you have you lips puckered against cyniques ass any tighter?? Could you be any more OBVIOUS AND DESPERATE to keep her as an ally? What a freakin joke you are. Oh you are so right cynique, oh please donât get mad at me cynique! give it a rest aready!! Posted on Friday, November 05, 2004 â 06:22 pm:
Some blacks may find that âinside jokeâ to be âfunnyâ, however, Iâm sure not all do. To me, itâs a joke that is used only in the company of very, very close friends, not in a public arena with millions of people watching. I have no point to prove to anyone Cynique. There are some people who seem like natural born leaders and others that just donât. Edwards, in my opinion, just seems to lack a certain something that would propel him into being a tremendous leader. Obama on the other hand, he just seems like he has unlimited amounts of potential and the zeal to follow throughâjust a basic difference I feel about the menâ¦.thatâs it. Posted on Friday, November 05, 2004 â 07:36 pm:   	 Youâre entitled to your assessment about Obama, Moonsigns. But, neither you nor I know how many blacks were offended by the comment Obamaâs wife made. And, actually, I donât see why there would be a problem since he is her âbaby Daddy.â And I donât think it is uncommon for black women, no matter what her station in life, to teasingly refer to their childâs father as their âbaby daddy.â This ghetto expression has made it into the mainstream of the black idiom, at least in my part of the country which is where Obama is from. Blacks donât always have to be on their good behavior for fear of making a bad impression on white people. Sometimes they can just âget downâ and show that they havenât lost the common touch. Jesse Jackson does this all the time, as did Chicagoâs first black mayor, Harold Washington who once referred to a failing plan as being in âdeep doo-doo.â Anybody offended by what Obamaâs wife said, should just get over it. Posted on Friday, November 05, 2004 â 08:36 pm:
Though you have pointed out that this âghetto expressionâ has âmade it into the mainstream of the black idiomâ (which I agree), I donât think itâs safe to say that all blacks accept it. You know as well as I do that not all blacks think alike and that is why I know that, while you nor I can give exact numbers as to just how many blacks were offended, Iâm sure there are some out there who were. Again, there are no absolutes. âBlacks donât always have to be on their good behavior for fear of making a bad impression on white people.â-Cynique I agree. Do you feel this applies to all races though? Posted on Friday, November 05, 2004 â 09:05 pm:   	 Iâll be praying for Elizabeth Edwards. As for Michelle Obamaâs âbabyâs daddyâ commentâI was in room with black people from all over the world when she made it. A black American couple owned the home I was in. There was a Somali model and her biracial daughterâtwo Ethiopian couplesâtwo Kenyan menâa black couple from Mississippi, another black couple from Arizona, my black mother from Wash.D.C. and two black couples from Jamaica and one from Aruba, West Indies. WE ALL LAUGHED âinfectiouslyâ when Michelle made the commentâ¦and in that momentâ¦.they became REAL PEOPLE to us. The whole room fell in love with them even more than before. MOONâthe only kind of blacks who take offense at a MARRIED black woman calling her hubby âmy babyâs daddyââ¦.are the INSECURE ones who have something to prove to âwhite peopleââand usually, those type of blacks wish to BE white themselves. I find it hard to believe that anyone with any real intelligence would be offended by a Harvard GraduateâMARRIED to her âbabyâs daddyââ¦.being benevolent enough and politically astute enough to affirm the realities of so many black women who have no education, no men in their lives or their childrensâ lives and who NEEDED that bit of affirmation/recognition from a sista on high. Very rarely are single black mothersâmost of whom MAKE A WAY OUT OF NO WAY every damned day of the weekâ¦.given their props. I know MANY âghetto womenâ who hold down a job, go to school, singlehandedly feed and clothe their babiesâ¦.and BLACK WOMEN in America have been doing this for DECADES. Without much praise. I loved Michelle Obama for having the presence of mind and âcultural caringâ to use HER POSITION to affirm a ghetto saying. And I greatly admire so called âghetto blacksâ FAR MORE than I do the black middle class. I love it that OBAMA is so very âKenyanâ and regal and presents himself as a man of his people. FOR THAT..and because I so love his wifeâs grace and class, I will spend thousands to support him. Posted on Friday, November 05, 2004 â 11:25 pm:
Well, Moonsigns, as far as Iâm concerned this is much ado about nothing since, as we agree, nobody knows how widespread the disapproval was of Michelleâs remark. And who really cares about something this trivial? I think your reference to it says more about you than her. The âbaby daddyâ reference was no more of a faux pas than some of the things that Kerryâs wife said, or what Laura Bush might say if she could ever stop smiling like an idiot and say anything. Posted on Saturday, November 06, 2004 â 06:55 am:
Cynique, Beyond this discussion, Michelleâs âbaby daddyâ comment is not a part of my daily thought pattern. Someone had mentioned it earlier in a thread and that is why I shared my feelings about it. Laura Bush does say too little, which can be both good and bad. Kerryâs wife said too much. I wouldnât have minded her hubby for president, but her as the first ladyâ¦.that would have been something! LOL Posted on Saturday, November 06, 2004 â 07:53 am:
Moonsigns, I agree with your contrast of Edwards and Obama. Though both men are unproven as leaders, Obama appears to have more innate Presidential timber. And, actually, the smarter/better leader in the Edwardsâ household is his wife Elizabeth. That chick is smarter than a MOFO! But really, the âbaby daddyâ thing is just a jokeâ¦between friends. And when I see you (and other you White people) overreact to something as trivial as that, I canât help wondering whether you are building Obama up just so heâll have a higher pedestal from which you can knock him down from. PS: My wife calls me her âbaby daddyâ all the time as a term of endearment. And after I received positive confirmation from the DNA tests, I learned to appreciate that. And more here. *** From âA Brief History of baby-daddiesâ published in Slate Magazine two years ago: Celebrity gossips are not known for their contributions to English letters. In tabloids, the copy is breathless, the headlines are stunningly literal, and the âhand-writtenâ photo captions seem to toggle between âAwww!â and âEw!â But as they zero in on celebrity mating and breeding rituals, the magpies keep breaking new linguistic ground. First they imported the British term bump, a noun used to refer to the protruding abdomen of a pregnant starlet. Then they awarded celebrity couples mash-up nicknames like âBennifer,â âBrangelina,â and âTomKat.â Now theyâve seized upon baby-daddy and baby-mama, two useful terms that have long appeared in hip-hop and R&B lyrics, and are slowly stripping them of their emotional fangs. The Oxford English Dictionary defines baby-daddy as âthe father of a womanâs child, who is not her husband or (in most cases) her current or exclusive partner.â The baby-mama entry follows the same template with the genders reversed. But some gossip writers have been adopting the first part of the definition and ignoring the second. Salon recently called Tom Cruise âKatie Holmesâ baby-daddy,â even though the couple is engaged. And Gawker refers to Keven Federline as âBritney Spearsâ baby-daddy,â even though the couple has been married for more than a year.  â¦These days, the terms no longer seem âchiefly African-Americanââtheyâre everywhere, the latest bits of hip-hop lingo to gain widespread use. Baby-daddy is the new bling. Online, you can buy âJesus is my baby-daddyâ magnets, tote bags, and beer steins. There is a drink called the âbabymama.â Scott Hoffman, the bassist for the glam rock band the Scissors Sisters, goes by the stage name âBabydaddy.â Some of this cultural paraphernalia retains the old, loaded sense of the term: You can, for example, download a âSalty Baby Mamaâ ringtone so that when people call, your phone will jangle and thrum while a womanâs voice says, âBaby, I know you hear this damn phone ringing. Iâm going to beat your ass, as soon as I see you.â But just as often, the connotations are strictly biological. Baby-mama has even made inroads in Japan, where itâs being used on a Web site that appears to sell strollers. Who knows why these terms became catchphrases? Perhaps itâs just that theyâre metrically pleasing: Baby-mama and baby-daddy are undeniably fun to say. But itâs the novelty factor that explains how the words lost their negative connotations. Sure, there are many gossip writers who still use the terms in their original senses (calling dancer Carlos Leon âMadonnaâs baby-daddy,â for example) because theyâre useful, reducing a complex chain of possessivesâMadonnaâs daughterâs fatherâto a nice, comprehensible noun. But it seems there are also plenty of writers who just like the way the words sound and donât care much about the stigma once attached to babydaddyhood. When news came last week that Anna Nicole Smith may be pregnant, it was no surprise that bloggers immediately began speculating about the identity of the âbaby daddy.â It may be a long time before you hear a quaint, old-fashioned âWhoâs the dad?â *** Here comes the knee-jerk avalanche of hate mail: from pearlene_scott@cox.net

It is degrading for a married woman, especially of her stature to be referred to this way, but of course thatâs why you found pleasure in doing it. It also has a racist tone to it, which is also way youâve found pleasure in doing it. For someone who looks like she is in need of racial tolerance, you certainly have a lot of nerve. There are many racist references that I can name when I look at you, many which your so called colleagues at Fox have already uttered behind youâre back, Iâm sure.

Video
 Fresh from its fist bump flap, Fox News is taking new flak for a screen caption that referred to Michelle Obama as her husband's "baby mama." Even conservative commentator Michelle Malkin, who was on camera Wednesday afternoon when the line "OUTRAGED LIBERALS: STOP PICKING ON OBAMA'S BABY MAMA" flashed underneath her, has distanced herself from the phrase. In a posting Wednesday night, Malkin wrote: "I did not write the caption, and I was not aware of it when it ran (the Baltimore studio doesnât have a monitor). I donât know if the caption writer was making a lame attempt to be hip, clueless about the original etymology of the phrase, or both." Still, Malkin goes off on a tangent on how Michelle Obama, in the past, has referred to her mate as her "baby's daddy" (the point being, presumably, that the phrase was thus in play). You can read Malkin's post here; it includes some of the nasty e-mails she received following her Fox appearance. The folks at Fox are developing something of an obsession over Barack Obama's wife. Tonight's Bill O'Reilly show, according to network promos, will include a discussion of her by conservative radio talk show host Laura Ingraham. The other recent brouhaha ...  ... involving the network was sparked by a segment it did on the fist bump the Obamas exchanged on stage last week as he prepared to proclaim that he had secured sufficient delegates to win the Democratic presidential race. A few days later, Fox anchor E.D. Hill, reading words on a teleprompter that someone else had written, wondered whether the gesture might be interpreted as a "terrorist fist jab." Hill later apologized. Perhaps Fox hired a few too many summer interns to handle some of its behind-the-scenes writing chores. -- Don Frederick   Fox Apologizes for Calling Michelle Obama a âBaby Mamaâ Sections Sites Sections Search Plus Popular on NYMag.com Tags: Top Stories Most Viewed Stories Latest News from Daily Intelligencer FOLLOW: 
            Yet the network refuses to apologize for making a bad rhyme.
            Fox News has possibly revealed itself to be sexist, racist, and out of touch, all at the same time! The network has come under fire for referring to Michelle Obama as a âbaby mamaâ during a segment in which anchor Megyn Kelly interviewed conservative pundit Michelle Malkin. The two were discussing a conservative group's planned anti-Obama documentary when a caption popped up on the screen reading: "Outraged liberals: Stop picking on Obama's baby mama!"  First of all, a network shouldnât be allowed to have the word âNewsâ in its title if it goes around saying things like âObamaâs Baby Mama!â This isnât E!, guys. Youâd never see Ryan Seacrest headlining a story about Lindsay Lohanâs Sapphic relationship with Samantha Ronson with âLindsayâs Alliance With Member of the Female Persuasion Called Into Question, Pending Investigation.â These news networks need to stay on their side of the playground. But this is another blog post for another time.  The lamest part is that the network didnât even use the slang correctly! The Obamas were married before their children were born, and a baby mama is supposed to be someone who is the mother of your baby but not your spouse. (This is beginning to remind us of the time we tried to explain to our mother what it means to "get your swerve on.")  Malkin points out that Michelle once referred to Obama as her âbabyâs daddyâ when he won his Senate seat, but the âshe can say it, why canât I say it?â excuse never really holds water, does it? There is a lot of slang out there which suddenly becomes inappropriate when co-opted by another group.  So was it a calculated move intended to demean Michelle Obama or just an ignorant and unfortunate use of rhyming? Fox News issued this statement today from Bill Shine, senior vice-president of programming for Fox News Channel: "A producer on the program exercised poor judgment in using this chyron during the segment." It will be interesting to see how the Obama camp responds to this because Michelle canât really get offended without potentially alienating the baby-mama contingent (a fairly large group considering almost 40 percent of all American children are born out of wedlock). âWhatâs wrong with being a âbaby mamaâ?â they could ask. âWhat are you trying to imply?â And one would be wise not to mess with the baby mamas. They spend a lot of time disciplining children and can be most fierce. âNoelle Hancock Fox News Calls Michelle Obama âObamaâs Baby Mamaâ [Salon] FDA Says âParmesanâ Cheese Might Actually Be Cheddar or Wood Pulp How Hillary Clinton Won Harlem U.S. Marshals Are Arresting People in Texas Who Have Outstanding Student Loans Adele Took Her Son to Disneyland in an Anna Costume and Is the Coolest Mom Ever Crazy Nut Donald Trump Thinks George W.

Whatever Fox News Would Like To Take a Moment To Remind You That the Obamas Are As Black As Satanâs Festering, Baby-EatingÂ Soul Post navigation I'M STUCK WITH A VALUABLE FRIEND 
			336 thoughts on âFox News Would Like To Take a Moment To Remind You That the Obamas Are As Black As Satanâs Festering, Baby-EatingÂ Soulâ		 WHATEVER Whatever Days Whatarchives Administrivia The Big Idea Whatever Everyone Else is Saying Whatwitter Whatever Just Happened  The Name of My Next Band Random Whatever Scalzi Elsewhere on the Internet Share:  Back in the day â you know, when presidential candidates were respectably white â news organizations called potential First Ladies âwives.â But now that black folks are running, we can get all funky fresh with the lingo, yo. So itâs basically fine for Fox News to use âBaby Mamaâ for Michelle Obama, slang that implies a married 44-year-old Princeton-educated lawyer is, to use an Urban Dictionary definition of the term, âsome chick you knocked up on accident during a fling who you canât stand but you have to tolerate cuz she got your baby now.â Because the Obamas are black! And the blacks, theyâre all relaxed about that shit, yo. Word up. And anyway, as the caption clearly indicates, itâs not Fox News thatâs calling Michelle Obama âBaby Mama,â itâs outraged liberals. Fox News is just telling you what those outraged liberals are saying. They didnât want to use the term âBaby Mama.â But clearly they had no choice. Meanwhile, over at her personal site, Michelle âFox Newsâ Ethnic Shieldâ Malkin defends Fox Newsâ use of the âBaby Mamaâ phrase by essentially making two arguments. First, Michelle Obama once called Barack Obama her âbabyâs daddy,â and as we all know, a married woman factually and correctly calling her husband her childâs father is exactly the same as a major news organization calling a potential First Lady some chick what got knocked up on a fling. Second, the term âbaby-daddyâ has gone out into the common culture; heck, even Tom Cruise was called Katie Holmesâ baby-daddy, you know, when he impregnated her and she subsequently gave birth while the two were not married, which is exactly like what happened between Michelle and Barack Obama, who were married in 1992 and whose first child was born six years later. So by Malkinâs reasoning itâs perfectly fine for Fox News to call Michelle Obama the unmarried mother of Barack Obamaâs children because an entirely different phrase has to her mind entered the common culture, and there was this one time that Michelle Obama once uttered something that sounded like that entirely different phrase, which is not the phrase that Fox News used. But wait! Malkin also points to someone in her comment thread saying that one time, Michelle Obama actually used the phrase âbaby daddyâ! No apostrophe! Itâs in a comment thread, so it must be true. Therefore, Michelle Obama apocryphally using a piece of urban slang makes it perfectly okay for Fox News to use an entirely different piece of urban slang. And thatâs why, you see, it wonât be a problem for Bill OâReilly to refer to Barack Obama as âmy niggaâ on the next OâReilly Factor. Itâs shit like this that makes this story on CNN, about whether Barack Obama should be considered black or biracial, an absolute hoot. Hereâs a quick test on whether Obama should be considered fully black: Poof! Barack Obama has been magically transported to a KKK meeting in deepest, whitest Klanistan without his Secret Service detail. Thereâs a rope and a tree nearby. What happens to Obama? If you say, âwhy, Barack Obama walks out of there alive, of courseâ then sure, heâs biracial. Also, youâre a fucking idiot. To everybody who cares about Obamaâs racial identity, either positively or negatively, the man is a black man, married to a black woman, who has black children. Black black black black black black black black. It sure as hell matters to Fox News, which is why itâs dog whistling about Barack so loudly that itâs vibrating the windows. Calling Michelle Obama a âbaby mamaâ isnât just Fox News having a happy casual larf; itâs using urban slang to a) remind you the Obamas are black, b) belittle a woman of considerable personal accomplishment, and c) frame Barack Obamaâs relationship to his wife and children in a way that insults him, minimizes his love for and commitment to his family, and reinforces stereotypes about black men. Someone at Fox News just ought to call Barack Obama âboyâ at some point so we can have all the cards right out there on the table. This will keep happening. Fox News will keep finding ways to remind its viewers that the Obamas are black (and possibly Muslim), Michelle Malkin will continue to make excuses for Fox Newsâ dog-whistling racism that expose the fact that sheâs about as familiar with logical thinking as a rainbow trout is with knitting, and eventually some portion of the Fox News audience will get to the ballot box in November convinced that theyâre not really racists, they just know that thereâs something about that Obama boy they just donât like. This is how it will go. Letâs not pretend itâs not part of equation, this election year. Wow.  Has there been any reaction on the part of the Obamasâ yet?  âCause frankly, if it were me, Iâd be sending my attack-dog PR flacks after Fox news over this. Yâknow, I really have difficulty processing how fscked up it is that it actually, yâknow, seems important to some people that A) Obamaâs black and B) Hillary was a woman.  Maybe itâs because I grew up with Maggie Thatcher in power or something, but itâs just hair-rippingly distressing that such utter, inconsequential non-issues seem to be so vastly important to some people. *sighs* The hell?

http://www.alexwilson.com/projects/journal/foxnews_guide_to_terrorist_gang_signs.php You, sir, are my hero yet again. Also, I predict the Malkinites will descend on this thread by comment number 14. Because, you know, when I think of teh blacks, I think Muslims!  Everyone knows that black people were imported as slaves from Mesopotamia (Eye-rack for you rednecks out there in the audience)!  Of course, how does âbaby mammaâ apply then, if theyâre like the âEye-rackiesâ because we all know that Muslim women canât be seen in public or have sex outside of marriage on account of how they hate freedom! Are there any other bad stereotypes Iâm forgetting to include? The stupid!  It BURNS! And âOutraged liberals: Stop picking on Obamaâs baby mamaâ also sounds like something from Jerry Springer. So they win double points with their audience. Sigh. Oh John, you had me at âWord up.â And the blacks, theyâre all relaxed about that shit, yo. They be all relaxed about that shit.  Dang, donât nobody learn grammar these days? @ Scalzi: Yeah.  Youâre right. Christ on a crackerâ¦ I knew we would see the ugly side of racist twits once Obama got the nod, but that just takes the cake. I hope the Obamaâs do respond, as this is just unacceptable even with what passes for journalism these days. Iâve linked back to you on my WordPress, and I tip my hat to you for this article. âI want you  to get up right now, go the window, open it, stick your head out and yell, âIâm as black as hell and Iâm not going to take this anymoreâ.â Being an Australian, and not really following the US election, US slang or Fox news, I have to say that on a purely aesthetic level, I like the euphonious matching of âObamaâ and âmamaâ. Obamaâs black?!  I had no idea!  Why didnât someone TELL ME?  Here I was just assuming he had a really great tan.  In January. Iâm still so amazed that people actually care whether Obama is black or notâ¦ Iâm more concerned that I think his health policy is crap. Of course, itâs less crap than McCainâs. Iâm over 40 and I donât care about race or sex. I have just registered as a Democrat for the first time in 22 years and at this point, I might vote for a Martian. To be fair, I actually think McCain is pretty moderate. But, he is two Presidential terms too late. Iâm a little concerned about Obamaâs views toward Israel, but not enough to one issue vote the other way. Really, where is this LCD that Fox is aiming at? Do they actually know how to vote? Fox News and other right-wing mouthpieces are getting desperate to stay relevant in this election year.  I donât think Fox will survive the summer if they keep up with this inane and childish bullshit.  I mean, you go from that brainless moppet E.D. Hillâs gibberish about a âterrorist fist jab,â to this, and itâs clear Fox is nothing more than a cult of incompetent, unabashed frauds doing their damnedest to pretend that theyâre journalists. â¦ Michelle Malkin will continue to make excuses for Fox Newsâ dog-whistling racism that expose the fact that sheâs about as familiar with logical thinking as a rainbow trout is with knittingâ¦ Iâm just going to savor that phrase. You are right, of course.  Fox News = Spew-inducing disinformation. Thanks for the brilliant rant.  Iâve recently sworn off all 24-hour ânewsâ networks, and this sort of nonsense (and Chris Matthews in general) is precisely the reason why. âI donât think Fox will survive the summer if they keep up with this inane and childish bullshitâ Why would this summer be any different?  This is the same inane crap theyâve been spewing since the start. You really ought to put warning labels on rants that are this funny.  This entire thing should be labeled as a choking hazard. Iâd also subscribe you your newsletter, but since Iâm already reading your blog, that would be needlessly redundant. In closing, well said, and thank you for this. â¦and yet again the advancement of the human race is stumped by morphological divergence. I want a refund. I canât decide if this outrages me to the point where I should start a letter-writing campaign, or if itâs so inane and transparent it just deserves a head shake and a rueful chuckle. Either way, the logical fallacies in use by Fox News are justâ¦stunning. Richard on 12 Jun 2008 at 12:15 pm Iâd also subscribe you your newsletter, but since Iâm already reading your blog, that would be needlessly redundant. You wouldnât be saying that if the newsletter subscriptions came with free mittens knitted by trout. Well, I must say Fox is certainly making it easy for its detractors to go all foamy. Now if we could just generate this level of outrage when seated politicians call our soldiers murderers and terroristsâ¦ I have to admit I was unfamiliar with the cultural connotations of âbaby mama,â so I had to look it up. Iâve been using ââ¦â to visually indicate me opening and closing my mouth, being unable to come up with something to say.  I seem to be doing it more and more frequently, of late. Do you know the worst thing about all this crap? The fact that youâve still got several MORE months of it to go till itâs over. And by âoverâ I mean till the months upon months of coverage of Floridaâs electoral stuff up starts in the aftermath of the presidential result.
(Come-on, you just know that Florida is gonna screw-the-pooch and mess it up for everyone) sighâ¦MM and Fox news:  Idiots in a handbasket. This really outrages me.  I hate the words Baby Mama.  Itâs stupid and NO ONE SHOULD BE CALLED THEM.  Not Michelle Obama NO ONE.  It implies they canât think for themselves.  That they are incapable.  Itâs not true and insanely degrading. Some one called Nancy Reagan âeye candyâ a few weeks ago.  It makes me just as upset. These woman are brave enough to stand by their husbands while this **** is flung.  They deserve more. Michelle: This is why Krissy has forbidden me from running for President. She wants no part of that sort of nonsense. Dang.  I thought they would attack his experience first.  Good thing I didnât bet on that. Iâm a conservative and Fox News irks the hell out of me a lot of the time.  âFair and balancedâ is a load of crap â I really wish that media outlets (and not just Fox, btw) would actually recognize and present their biases.  That way, those folks that donât scrounge around for news would at least be aware that, in fast, the news theyâre watching has an angle to it. To my mind, there is no such thing as an unbiased, neutral opinion.  The best we can hope for as consumers of information is to understand the biases of our sources for that information, and then synthesize conclusions from multiple sources representing a broad spectrum of bias. As to the âBaby Mamaâ thingâ¦ perhaps they thought they were making a fluffy joke, or perhaps notâ¦ either way, without a direct quote from one of the âoutraged liberalsâ, that choice of terminology is pretty tasteless & unprofessional. Back to my TV motto: âEvery time I watch television I remember why I donât watch television.â Anny Mouse: Well, see. He can explain away his lack of experience. But he canât explain away being black. Brian: âTo my mind, there is no such thing as an unbiased, neutral opinion.â Indeed not. What one does hope for is a bit of common sense. Fox News isnât the only news org that flubs up, but they do seem to continue to flub up consistently in the same direction. I hope Senator Obama says this:  âIf the Right Wing Propaganda Machine wants to engage in a debate over the candidates personal Family Values and devotion to the sanctity of marriageâ¦ well, thatâs a debate Iâm happy to have with John McCain!â Iâm just picturing the mayhem Krissy would visit upon Fox News.  Oh, the smiting!  Oh, the (sorta) humanity! Did anyone read Thomas Friedmanâs oped yesterday?

Other people in the world think we have gotten past this type of stuff, because Mr Obama is the presumptive nominee.  I guess thatâs wishful thinking on their part. Fox, The Washington Times, and other such âunbiased mediaâ remind me why my primary news sources are the BBC and NPR. Fox âNewsâ doesnât make mistakes.  Itâs all done intentionally.  Itâs the new racism by which conservatives hide their racism behind being âfairâ and then they claim they are being persecuted when their racism is called out. Iâve been wondering of late whether we should re-institute preconditions for democratic participation.  Rather than the plutocratic or just plain discriminatory prerequisites of race or land-holding, we should introduce some test for 1) appreciation of uncertainty; and 2) ability to make oneâs own mind up.  That is to say, you ask someone: 1) have you ever been wrong? and 2) did hearing two sides of an argument sway you from a previous belief to a new one?  (I am totally not serious about this, but bear with me) Fox News frequently panders to folks who believe â strongly â in one particular set of values, and the use of baby mama simply reinforces some deeply held, uncontested beliefs of a subset of the viewership of the channel.  Telling that group that baby mama is demeaning and inappropriate would be like telling the national enquirer to use a little more tact in their reporting.  Plus, you might get a knee-jerk âI hate PCâ response. The lack of critical thinking is an epidemic that has swept America over the last several years, and we need to bring people together who are good critical thinkers to really hash out issues and work on raising everybody up, rather than lowering us down.  Iâd like to work my reptilian brain into submission, rather than submitting to it. I should note that this issue exists on the left, right, up and down perspectives.  Even the objectivists get frothy about a few things :) Personally I hope that Fox should should go even further.
Perhaps by refering to Obama from now on as âDa Pimpâ. And Michelle as âHis Hoâ.
PLEASE FOX. SHOW THE US AND THE WORLD YOUR RIGHT WING RACIST REPORTING TACTICS!
It will *ONLY* put the Republican party to deeper shame and when âDa Pimpâ and âHis Hoâ become the President of the US in November it will be these STUPID ASS Fox News reporters who will be swinging from the trees by a noose.
Hopefully by suicideâ¦
/end rant. GOD I HATE IGNORANCE! John, thanks.  Iâm really, really busy at work today, youâre a better writer than I, and this is excellent.  Now I can just link to you and not stress about my own blog entry on the subject. Actually one of the things I like about Senator Obama is that he usually doesnât get all excited about these issues and takes the time to make a calm, deliberate and pointed response. John, an excellent political post, as usual.  What is so enjoyable about the Obama / McCain race is watching the wheels come off Fox.  Fox was clearly pushing for a Clinton/Gulianni match up and they are still spluttering about in shock that the people (even the conservative people) did not hove to.  It has reduced them to base instincts like this and the equally classic âterroist fist bumpâ comment from last week.  Equally fun to see Oberman beat OâRileys rating for the first time.  Maybe people are waking upâ¦. Whoa, Obama has a black child? No way! Sometimes I wonder if Stephen Colbert is moonlighting as a writer for Fox News.  Nothing else makes sense.  People canât be that dumb, right?  And still feed themselves and remember to breathe? Gee, Thanks, Fox News! Lovely bit of ironyâ¦I just flipped over to CNN.com for no good reason and what do I see? The first headline in the Latest News section: âMichelle Obama may face jabs in election fightâ No, really? You think? Now, in the interests of fairness and balance Faux should adopt my pet name for Cindy McCain â Crackhead Barbie. OK, she wasnât addicted to crack, she was addicted to pain pills.  That she stole from a childrenâs charity.  But she did rehab instead of jail time becauseâ¦ becauseâ¦ sheâs Cindy McCain. I love you. Deeply. In a transitory, thank goodness someone has a clue way, but no less sincere for that. I think itâs just suppossed to be a catchy phrase. Say it out loud. It rhymes. I agree that it should never have been said but really arenât there bigger fish to fry? The media is trying to dumb down politics to fit within the writing style of People or Us Magazines. Itâs a good thing his last name is Obama and not Obigger. I can see the cover stories now How old does McCain look in this picture? See Rachel Rayâs new fashion donât! Exclusive interview with Obamaâs Baby Mama! Here is my philosophy. If you are intelligent to realize how offensive, biased, and ridiculous 24 hour news stations are (both CNN and Fox News) donât watch themâ¦ Iâm just disappointed that they settled for the phrase âpicking onâ when they could have used the more euphonius âhating on.â My head just exploded. No, really. It did.
After working in a newsroom and having my heart broken during the last election, Iâve been avoiding most of the election coverage this time around. At least until, yanno, weâre within sniffing distance of the actual day. What I think pisses most of us off is that crap like this happens, and then no one gets called on itâas if the powers that be (in either camp) think that ignoring the problem will make it go away, or that acknowleging it gives it power. Like in 2000: McCain had a black baby!? Well, you know, that was just all in good fun/part of the election process (heh heh). And Johnnie boy rolled over and let the Republican party rub his belly and make nice. And *that* is exactly why I lost all respect for the man. The best thing for Obama to do? Call them on this bullshit. Calling people on their crap freaks bullies out. And if there is one thing this country needs, itâs some honesty and for the bullies to be spanked for being such asshats. Rant over. âIf you are intelligent to realize how offensive, biased, and ridiculous 24 hour news stations are (both CNN and Fox News) donât watch themâ¦â Well, yes, but where to go after them?  I stopped reading MSNBC.com a while ago and was using the New York Times homepage for Firefox start, but then thereâs: âBrian:
âTo my mind, there is no such thing as an unbiased, neutral opinion.â Indeed not. What one does hope for is a bit of common sense. Fox News isnât the only news org that flubs up, but they do seem to continue to flub up consistently in the same direction.'â (John, up above) I generally agree that thereâs no such thing as unbiased, neutral opinion, no matter how objective a news story might read (because one must also consider that story choice itself reveals biases), but then, what now?  Fox is awful, CNN not much better, MSNBC amateurish at best, Olbermannâs jumped the shark . . . I mean it comes a point you have to look up and notice that the best news show out there is The Daily Show, and where does that leave journalism? Iâve heard the BBC is a good news source. Great rant. Worthy of Lewis Black (heh). And so, it beginsâ¦â¦â¦.. If weâre (when I say we, I mean you, as Iâm a Brit, but as your current Prez took his lapdog Tony and our country into a war, I feel the love) lucky, theyâll keep this level of ordure up, and drive any undecided middle-of-the-road voters into the baby-daddyâs arms. Hereâs hoping. Krissy is one smart woman.  You should make sure you thank her again after this.  :) I dunno, Krissy has a baseball bat and isnât afraid to use it.  Maybe she should send it to Michelle Obama. Iâd love to say Iâm surprised by this but Iâm not and truthfully, the Obamaâs probably arenât either. Really, for a whole lot of Black folks who made it into institutes of higher learning and beyond, this is just one more round of âhow dare you be up in here with us?â  The slings and arrows are just that but itâs not the first time that these things will be said, nor will it be the last. The words are hurtful and if you confronted most of these folks with their stupid head on, all theyâll do is fall back on âwell, Black people (i.e. rappers) say this stuff all the time, so why canât we?â  At which point, Iâll roll my eyes and point them to the door because you canât fight that kind of stupid with logic. Rainbow trout and knitting?  Nope.  But perch are widely regarded not only for their knitting skills, as well as crocheting.  They make the cutest tea cozies. *gives standing ovation* I can understand in the arena of 24 hour news that the demand for quantity trumps quality. I can also understand the surge of extremely biased reporting when your network counts on branded headline repetition in boosting advertising revenue. I choose not to watch Fox because of these facts. Likewise, I could have thrown my shoe at a CNN anchor who was extremely excited about fresh flood footage. He was grinning from ear to ear as he described the total annihilation of a house being thrown into a river. What incenses me the most about this particular case is the pure lack of respect for another member of the human race. This has nothing to do with being âpolitically correct.â This is a violation of basic human courtesy. The minute something directly linked or representative with negative connotation becomes socially acceptable as a label or generalization, is the moment the social fabric of our civilization starts to unravel. Rudeness begets rude as idiocy breeds idiots. Fox has proven themselves as a serious contender of both. Faux News strikes again . . . Scalzi for TEH WIN!i!i!i You are once again proven the master of insight in the Blogosphere.  You are, sir, my hero for your takedown of the âOMFG heâs BLACK! BLACKITY-BLACK-BLACK-BLACK!!!â conservative meme. God, thatâs just disgusting. Itâs obviously intended to push as many âliberalâ buttons as possibleâ¦ and Malkinâs just going to keep digging that hole for them. Fair and balanced, my ass. Whereâs their coverage insulting Mrs. McCain? I guess nothing to cover, since sheâs boring and unremarkable and not black. Fucking disingenous bigoted muppets. When I saw that screenshot, I thought it just HAD to be Photoshopped. It couldnât be real. But it looks like I just underestimated Fox Newsâ capacity for crassness. Even if the brain-damaged chimpanzees playing editors at Fox News honestly had no idea just how much of an insult it is to refer to an accomplished and MARRIED woman as anyoneâs âbaby mama,â youâd think they would have some inkling that the phrase has no place on a news program, except maybe a satirical one. (That said, Iâm hoping to see some reference to this fiasco in the next issue of The Onion, because that will make me feel much better.) I am really pissed. Barack Obama is the first black man in history to become an American presidential candidate, and for that he gets a pack of yahoos throwing ghetto slang at his wife. Hail, F*cking hail! Holy crap!  O_o  How do hey get away with this shit these days??? Iâm going to copy this whole thing to my LiveJournal (giving proper credit for awesome blogging and linking back here.) if you donât mind.  I missed this â and it should be put out there. â¦had someone sent this to Jon Stewart?  ::evil grin:: Youâre my freakinâ hero, John. Oh, and Fox issued a statement saying that the programâs producer used âpoor judgementâ. REALLY!?  YA THINK!? *rollseyes* D.Paul on 12 Jun 2008 at 3:16 pm Rainbow trout and knitting? Nope. But perch are widely regarded not only for their knitting skills, as well as crocheting. They make the cutest tea cozies. And, letâs not overlook the many contributions of the Walleye population to the world of auto-mechanics and gardening (though, the carp were the ones who started the whole topiary craze). Really, man.  Freshwater fish just donât get the credit they deserve.  And, itâs unfortunate that John would judge all fish merely on the actions of a few god damned lazy trout. Dilemma: Should I continue to watch The Colbert Reportâ¦ or switch to Fox âNewsâ? Which is the biggest parody?
:-S Fox News Channel isnât news at all. Itâs a propaganda outlet with very specific goals in mind. One word, everyone: Truthiness. These tactics âthe baby mamaâ and âthe terrorist fist jabâ are all part of a smoke screen to get us on the subject of race and away from talking about the economy, the war, energy, and health care. Once that discussion begins- game over! Thanks for the great rant. It wasnât Fox, but Obamaâs already been called boy. This is just a distraction!
Iâve never known Fox News to do anything like this before!
This is not the Fox News I knew! Reason #umpteen why I havenât watched television news in two years. But I wrote an email to News Corp anyway, what the heck. Itâs Fox News â whaddya âspect? Donât âspect no R-E-S-P-E-C-T from the disrespectable. Iâm trying to decide whether this or the âterrorist fist jabâ is better. Iâm leaning toward this just because it came out of a PoCâs mouth. John Scalzi: This is why Krissy has forbidden me from running for President. She wants no part of that sort of nonsense. This is why Iâd vote Krissy for President.  If she were running.  You want to be First Dude? You could shave your head again. Plus, she has a baseball bat and knows what to do with one. #41:  âSometimes I wonder if Stephen Colbert is moonlighting as a writer for Fox News. Nothing else makes sense. People canât be that dumb, right? And still feed themselves and remember to breathe?â Oh my goodness.  That has to be it!! How could I have missed that itâs just a news spoof?? #63:  âFreshwater fish just donât get the credit they deserve. â And salt water fish do?  LOL Ryan on 12 Jun 2008 at 5:22 pm Iâve never known Fox News to do anything like this before!
This is not the Fox News I knew! Youâre kidding, right? Itâs so hard to tell these days. today, youâre the angry black woman, John, because i canât even begin to approach this bullshit without killing a puppy. Thatâs a lot of black. Aunty Beeb has some inherent problems of itâs own, and not just with itâs news coverage if Iâm honest.  Iâll watch it, but I tend to prefer our (the UK that is) Channel 4 News. For a start, itâs an hour long, not 30 minutes, so instead of a 5 minute piece by some bloke sat in a studio the other side of the planet, you get quite a fair bit of information about a subject, not just a 5 minute precis about what some journalist learnt while he was buying a scotch in the airport bar.  Also, they do appear to try and not take sides, but this may just be me wishing that on it. Having said that, if any news channel broadcast a strap-line like that in this country, theyâd immediately have about 1,000 complaints to Ofcom, who actually have the teeth to do something about it.  From what I understand, the US communications watchdog appears to only be interested in the odd flash of boob during a âFootballâ (commas used, âcos itâs not real football ;-) match, or other stuff seen by anyone whoâs ever been breastfed, or had sex for that matter. I donât think of Obama as black.  More like The Mocha Messiah. Bets on which Faux talking head is the first to use the N-word? I think there is a bigger question here we are all missing. Does Michelle Malkin have a serious self-hatred thing going on? Todd Stull: No. Itâs entirely possible the amount of racism sheâs encountered in her life is minimal, especially as the rare bird she is: an attractive, reasonably articulate conservative woman of color, which makes her valuable to the conservative cause and has undoubtedly smoothed her way professionally. Why should she have self-hatred? Being an attractive conservative woman of color has opened lots of doors for her, I suspect. Oh crap there go the Simpsons.  The only Fox network show allowed in this house has been the Simpsons, but I canât, in good conscience, provide that network with anything resembling support.  Since I use digital cable they are monitoring use; so bye by Margeâ¦sob. I hope that this will be a topic on CNNâs Sunday âReliable Sourcesâ. It will be quite humorous to see someone try to defend the use of âBaby Mamaâ. George The whole tired âMichelle Obama once said babyâs daddyâ defense that Michelle Malkin is trying to use is ridiculous. I mean, Michelle Obama might have called her husband âhoneyâ at some point, does that mean Fox News will start calling him that to? Hey, Skar #24 â can you give me an example of when that happened?  I must have missed it. Was it one of those cases where one of our soldiers was was up on charges for murder?  âCause, mainly, Iâd be okay with people who were murderers who happened to ALSO be soldiers to be called murderers. Fox News is always the perfect recipe if I want indigestion and seething rage.  And CNN hired Glenn Beck.  People are stupid. But how cool and amazing it would be if Obama could win, with fucktards like these.  I want to hope, but I donât want to be dashed again.. It took me a couple of paragraphs to realize how angry you were about this (and then properly chastised myself  for this lapse in cognitive awareness as a Whatever veteran). And I loved how you proceeded to call Fox News out on their total absolute BS. Thank You! John Scalzi wrote: âIt sure as hell matters to Fox News, which is why itâs dog whistling about Barack so loudly that itâs vibrating the windows.â Yeah, but Fox is whistling out itâs @$$. Which is why I stopped being a broadcast reporter in 1990, and have never looked back. Well, thank the gods that Michelle Obama wasnât wearing a frilly scarf at the time they took that file footage. Michelle Malkinâs head might have spun right off. I mean, it is detachable and all. She seems to leave it at home all the time. I really like the pure sarcasm employed in your writing. Obama has the Fight the Smears web site. And thereâs the Michelle Obama Watch site people can contribute to as well. They canât very well talk about ISSUES now because they donât have a leg to stand on. I hope the Obamas ban Fixed Noise from here on out. That had to be one of the most hateful rants Iâve read yet this election year.  I shouldnât be surprised though that you secular-progressive socialists, borderline communists, smear tacticians continue to defame everything about Fox News.  You complain that Fox News is the right-wing news channelâ¦blah blah blah.  Okay, so the conservatives have one tv channel that leans their way.  Liberals control the rest of them.  I am willing to bet the majority of the people commenting on this blog have never even watched Fox News long enough to form their own opinion (not one derived from someone else you heard talking about Fox News) about their reporting.  Iâve watched them all, even Obamaâs HQ over there at MSNBC and from what Iâve seen, Fox News may lean a little right, but they are closer to being fair than any of the rest Iâve seen this election year.  So, I encourage all of you liberals and conservatives (I doubt there is many on this site) to mix it up a bit and watch Fox News for a few days to see a different perspective.  There must be an awful lot of truth reported on Fox News for you to hate them so much, John.  I bet youâre not too good at poker are you? Oh, and John, we donât need Fox News to subliminally suggest Obama is black by reporting on outraged liberals crying that Michelle Obama is being picked on.  I can see with my own eyes that he is black and guess what, I donât care.  Iâm not going to not vote for Obama because heâs black.  Iâm not going to vote for him because his answer to fixing the economy is to raise taxes.  Iâm not going to vote for him because he wants to disarm America.  Iâm not going to vote for him because he wants to ration our food and energy consumption.  Iâm not going to vote for him because he wants to subject us to taxation by the U.N.  Iâm not going to vote for him because he wants to surrender Iraq to Al Qaeda and Iran.  Iâm not going to vote for him because he demonstrated very poor judgment for a politician with aspirations of running for President by associating himself with known communists, racists and terrorists.  But I say again, Iâm not going to not vote for Obama because he is black. Token conservative done ranting now. Charles: âThat had to be one of the most hateful rants Iâve read yet this election year.â Get out more, Charles. Also, re: âtoken conservative,â there are lots of conservatives who visit and comment here, and rather more substantively and with fewer rote talking point cliches than you just have, so please get over yourself. Your problem is not that youâre conservative, itâs that your comment is unoriginal, boring and lame. Other conservatives here do better in their arguments. Strive to emulate them. John, You call it cliche, I call it truth.  Very typical of a liberal to sling insults to attempt to make a point.  What is unoriginal, boring and lame is the secular-progressive agenda Obama is attempting to push this election year.  Itâs all been done before and failed miserably.  I know, that was cliche according to you isnât it?  Of course it is.  Anything that is too close to the truth you will just dismiss it as cliche.  The more Obama defines his âChangeâ message, the more of the old school socialist agenda will be revealed.  Iâm sorry, did I say socialist?  I meant to say progressive.  That is what you liberals call it these days right?  No need to respond, I know the answer already. Charles: âYou call it cliche, I call it truth.â Of course you do, Charles. Thatâs the pity of it. Run along now, Charles, and let people who can actually think without the help of pre-printed index cards do what they were doing before you got here. Charles @ #92: Ok, if that was meant to be sarcasm, you need to kick it up a notch, âcause it really didnât come across that way. Of course, it is wasnât meant to be sarcasm, then you have just scared the f*ck out of me, âcause it terrifies me that someone presumably intelligent can actually believe lines like Okay, so the conservatives have one tv channel that leans their way. Liberals control the rest of them. and âve watched them all, even Obamaâs HQ over there at MSNBC and from what Iâve seen, Fox News may lean a little right, but they are closer to being fair than any of the rest Iâve seen this election year. A little right!?! And they say that the Brits are masters of understatement. *boggles* Iâm also deeply curious just how a government is supposed to supply all the services it is supposed to, like, say, Defense, law enforcement, and roads, without collecting taxes? But then, Iâm an Australian, and somewhat left-leaning even by Aussie standards, so by your lights, I guess that makes me as good as a communist. Charles @ 94, and the âcompassionate conservativeâ agenda has done SO MUCH for our countryâ¦.. two wars, record oil prices, failing schools, the housing crisis, the health care crisis (yes, it is a crisis when so many uninsured are using the emergency rooms for basic care) and the shredding of the constitution (torture, loss of privacyâ¦..) Yeah, we really need four more years of that. Donât feed the troll, Fiona. ;-) Butâ¦but the troll missed the âI bet you wonât let this comment out of moderationâ that is the hallmark of the true wingnut rant! Damn, John, you need to work on your quality control around here. Why should she have self-hatred? Being an attractive conservative woman of color has opened lots of doors for her, I suspect. Itâs also a very comfortable niche to be a conservative ârare birdâ who craps on all the other birds. The list of conservative women who have made their fortune being âthe only girl in the roomâ is a fairly long one. Malkin adds being a minority, and the cachet that gives her to crap on other minorities, to her resume. The powers-that-be are very good to their pets who donât let anyone else into the kennel. Canât say Iâm surprised, it being FoxNews and all. Anyway, brilliantly written. Great breakdown of the inherent absurdity in the various attempts to âexplained awayâ FoxNewsâ little stunt thus far. Well done. Ha!    John â posts like this arenât likely to net you one of those Instalanches. I think Jaydog has it rightâ¦ See, I always thought Baby Mama meant teenage mother.  That would be a little weird if his wife was a teenager.  In fact, that would probably bother me some. @ 94, Charles who is not in Charge, sez: â Iâm not going to vote for him because he wants to surrender Iraq to Al Qaeda and Iran.â Oh Charles, canât you do better than parroting Glen Beck?  (Oh wait, heâs a LIBERAL because heâs not on Fox, right?) Youâre apparently too clueless to understand that your own Republican ditto-masters have already handed Iraq on a platter to Iran.  But OâReilly-wannabes like yourself donât know a damned thing about the region â as long as you keep getting American soldiers killed there, youâre satisfied. See, to Republicans it really doesnât matter if a foreign occupation actually benefits the security of the U.S.A.  If it was actual security we wanted, there were hundreds of better ways to attain that for HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. But you like death.  You like seeing our soldiers killed. All of you Republicans, most of you cowardly chickenhawks yourselves, love seeing our soldiers die. As long as our soldiers are getting killed and wounded there, and a TRILLION of our hard-earned tax dollars are get wasted to prop up an Iran-friendly government, you and your chickenhawk buttboys are happy as clams. Traitor. Your ability to stick to Fox News more than makes up for your terrible abilities at Fantasy Football. I think Obama should announce that he is âcutting tiesâ with Fox News (a la Jim Johnson earlier this week)â¦He canât be associated with a news organization like thatâ¦ DavisDem: Thereâs a reason my fantasy football team was called âThe Mediocre Walloons,â you know. Scalzi, youâve been picked up by the progressive blogosphere! Oh, noes!!! Your conservative cover has been blownâ¦. http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/6/13/02320/2993/821/535140 Iâve been whispering to my friends that hey, did you know that Barack Obama had TWO children by a â¦ BLACK woman? â¦ for months, to good effect.  And here Michelle frigging MALKIN has to go and screw up the joke forever. I swear, what theyâre really trying to do is destroy satire as a form of humor. Alex: Heh. This should be fun. Itâs shit like this that makes this story on CNN, about whether Barack Obama should be considered black or biracial, an absolute hoot. Hereâs a quick test on whether Obama should be considered fully black: Poof! Barack Obama has been magically transported to a KKK meeting in deepest, whitest Klanistan without his Secret Service detail. Thereâs a rope and a tree nearby. What happens to Obama? If you say, âwhy, Barack Obama walks out of there alive, of courseâ then sure, heâs biracial. Also, youâre a fucking idiot. To everybody who cares about Obamaâs racial identity, either positively or negatively, the man is a black man, married to a black woman, who has black children. Black black black black black black black black. scalzi, you say a lot of ignorant things about race, but this really takes the cake. what makes you think that YOU, or anyone else for that matter, gets to decide what obamaâs race is? thatâs for obama to decide. period. and heâs not telling. you may THINK heâs telling, but heâs actually CAMPAIGNING. heâs not telling because of people like you, who donât get the whole multiracial thing, and would be suspicious of a person who insisted on his multiraciality, the way everybody was suspicious of tiger woods until he started winning everything in sight. everybody forgives a winner. and maybe once obama has won his second presidential race heâll start talking about himself as a multiracial. until then, stop thinking you know everything about race. you donât. and try googling âhypodescentâ and âcode switching.â oh yeah, and the KKK? what THEY think of obamaâs race doesnât count, either, if they actually still exist and arenât just a scare tactic used to bury the common ignorance and everyday racism that obama ACTUALLY faces. oh, by the way, that was me with the angry comment above. i wasnât trolling, just forgetful. claire: âscalzi, you say a lot of ignorant things about race, but this really takes the cake. what makes you think that YOU, or anyone else for that matter, gets to decide what obamaâs race is?â Well, let me flip that around to you, claire: If I or anyone else for that matter, decide that Obama is black (or biracial, or white) for the purposes of how I respond to him, how are you or anyone else going to stop me (or them)? âstop thinking you know everything about race.â I invite you, claire, to point to where I have suggested I know everything about race. Iâm not aware of making such a statement. I also invite you, claire, to kiss my ass, as far as telling me what I can or canât do, either in my thoughts or how I choose to express them on my own site. Imagine what would happen if Michelle Obama wore a paisley scarf! not much of an argument there, scalzi. hereâs some homework for you, for the next time you try to be intelligent about obama: http://www.racialicious.com/ claire: ânot much of an argument there, scalzi.â Well, claire, I work with what Iâm given. Thanks for dropping by, claire. As ever, your condescension to me on racial matters makes you an absolute delight to have in these quarters. Dang, I guess now that I know heâs black I canât vote for him, I was sorta hoping no one would mention it, but itâs out in the open nowâ¦  Sad thing is I donât even watch Foxâ¦.  Mr. Scalzi, youâve got furthered Foxâs agenda:  Had you not mentioned this, I might have been saved! Well, I can say this much.  Miss Malkin, on at least two occasions, has eaten items at a restaurant which were definitely not on the menu, as it were. Honestly, I have no idea what that means. Iâm not sure I want to know. Her food took a little longer to, uh, prepare than normal. Michelle Malkinâs a fussy eater? That explains everything. She is, actually. Fond of the BÃ©chamel, is she? @123: Superb. Skar: Now if we could just generate this level of outrage when seated politicians call our soldiers murderers and terroristsâ¦ Indeed, it is well known that itâs a violation of physical law for American soldiers to murder or terrorize.  Americans are good. We know this because we learned it in kindergarten. That guy with the white hair who said that nationalism is an infantile disease was a real dummy. Charles: Token conservative done ranting now. I bet you go out with your wife wearing a T-shirt that says âsheâs with stupidâ. claire: scalzi, you say a lot of ignorant things about race, but this really takes the cake. what makes you think that YOU, or anyone else for that matter, gets to decide what obamaâs race is? I sadly must inform you that a) you didnât understand his argument and b) you have demonstrated yourself to be a morally corrupt individual by launching an ad hominem attack instead of a rebuttal. Well said, Mr. Scalzi. Well said, indeed! Well written, John. Whatâs more interestingâand puzzlingâto me is that they apologized for itâthe 3rd time in 3 weeks (heartening, because it means theyâre *really* going off the rails). First it was Liz Trotta saying sheâd like to see Obama assassinated, then E.D. Hill with the âterrorist fist jab, and now this. But this is FOX, and FOX, like any good conservative, *never* apologizes (c.f. Jesse Helms, 1993, calling for President Clintonâs assassination). I dunno. The best I can figure is that the people who advertise on Fox got afraid. (I was going to write âgot spooked,â without realizing that, in this context, it might not be the best word choice.) And, yes, while I know Iâm not supposed to feed the troll, I will note that nowhere in his talking points did Charlie actually attempt to defend the use of the phrase. Apostroph or no apostroph â wow! I know we here in Germany have problems with apostrophes (we call it ânew spellingâ and itâs the greatest cultural paradigm shift since Martin Luther), but FOX actually takes it to a higher level.
And I will not utter something more political in this thread â¦ Looking at the screen grab, Iâd say Malkin is blacker than Michelle Obama. BEST. HEADLINE. IN THE WORLD. claire-
He should address the fact heâs biracial! Just about EVERYBODY on the damn planet knows Obamaâs half white and half Kenyan. I know this because a lieutenant in the Cambodian police force knows this. I want to thank your side for handing us the election. You make it easier every day. Your desperation is a thing of beauty and will provide months of hilarity. Hannah:âIâm hoping to see some reference to this fiasco in the next issue of The Onion, because that will make me feel much better.â I suspect that the people at The Onion are sadly shaking their heads at this and frustratedly muttering to each other, âChrist, how do we parody this? Weâre gonna be out of jobs soonâ¦.â . Charles:
You complain that Fox News is the right-wing news channelâ¦blah blah blah. Okay, so the conservatives have one tv channel that leans their way. Liberals control the rest of them. Funny, I must have missed MSNBC the day Laura was called âBushâs Baby Mamaâ, or âBushâs Bitchâ. Or was it âBushâs Bushâ. I guess I also missed the day CNN brought in a body language expert to critique âBushâs Terrorist Finger Jabâ. Fox News may lean a little right, but they are closer to being fair than any of the rest [â¦] Iâm not going to not vote for Obama because heâs black. Iâm not going to vote for him because his answer to fixing the economy is to raise taxes. Iâm not going to vote for him because he wants to disarm America. Iâm not going to vote for him because he wants to ration our food and energy consumption. Iâm not going to vote for him because he wants to subject us to taxation by the U.N. Iâm not going to vote for him because he wants to surrender Iraq to Al Qaeda and Iran. Iâm not going to vote for him because he demonstrated very poor judgment for a politician with aspirations of running for President by associating himself with known communists, racists and terrorists. Oh, yeah, definitely a Fox News viewer. We can tell by the facts you get wrong, i.e. all of them. . Sorry, John, responded before reading the âDonât feed the trollâ warning at #98. Will try to be more careful in the future. . Mythago:
The list of conservative women who have made their fortune being âthe only girl in the roomâ is a fairly long one. Somewhere in heaven, Yogi Berra is smiling â âNobody goes there anymore, itâs too crowded.â . You know, I also read National Review. I try to listen to several sides of an argumentâ¦ And it strikes me that Fox âNewsâ gives conservatism a really bad name. It certainly wouldnât hurt conservatives (or Republicans) to denounce the worst behavior of Fox âNews.â (And some do. Itâs not just Andrew Sullivan.) There are conservatives who like Barack Obama, who donât automatically think in Campaign Mode (i.e. âHillary Clinton is the ideal opponent to mobilize our base againstâ or âLetâs spread racist rumors in order to winâ). Those of you who consider yourselves conservative, look into your hearts and ask yourselves: Is this right? Can I support this sort of behavior? Thatâs the only question you need to ask: Is this right? (Or, if youâre Christians: Would Jesus approve?) Well, as a 62 year old white male who grew up in Alabama in the middle of the Civil Rights movement, I have to tell you now have a new reader for your commentary. This is absolutely the most incisive body blow take down of the incredible racist propaganda of Faux Noise network on this particular instance I think I have read. You made front page of dailykos.com, which led me here. I would give you a thumbs up, but you might, of course, think I was a terrorist infiltrator. Itâs gotten to the point where my brain has developed some sort of pattern recognition ability when it comes to Internet posts. If the post contains the initials âU.N.â, I instantly stop reading and file the entire thing under âTinfoil Brigadeâ. I think the post is hilarious and spot on, but I disagree with the writerâs argument that Obama isnât biracial or multiracial or part black and part white or whatever the term is for someone who has one parent of European heritage and another of African heritage. The example of Obama being transported to Klanistan is idiotic because even if Obama were able to prove to the folks about to lynch him that one of his parents was white, theyâd hang him anyway for being miscegenated, a word I stole from Homer Stokes in âO Brother, Where Art Thou?â If the correct term for people of African descent who live in America is African American, than Obama is African European American or European African American. That doesnât change the fact that his candidacy is historic or that bigots will consider him as African as Nelson Mandela; itâs just an accurate description of his heritage. I think a lot of people would howl, both in laughter and outrage, if Obama tried to deny his African heritage. (Not that he would.) Ignoring his European heritage doesnât carry the same symbolic weight, to say the least, but itâs still wrong. You are a total asshole. JGabriel @136: Somewhere in heaven, Yogi Berra is smiling â âNobody goes there anymore, itâs too crowded.â Actually, that should read âSomewhere in New Jersey.â Yogi is still very much alive. John,  I think heâs saying Michelle Malkin is a vampire.  I think she ate a bus boy. Iâm a conservative. Love The Whatever. Donât watch Fox News as much as I used to because, hey, Iâd rather like a little less yellow spittle-fleck with my news, please. And Fox News deserves all the flak they get for the classlessness of the âbaby mamaâ bit. The masks are already starting to come off the bigots, this one in Houston. http://www.khou.com/topstories/stories/khou080612_tnt_racistobamasign.27bc45a6.html Down here in Texas, Iâm not surprised by such stupidity.  Iâve already heard one guy drop such pearls of wisdom in conversation as âThat âboyâ [charming Southern word, that âboyâ] better not come to Texas,â and âHeâll take the side of the Muslims in a holy war!â  My girlfriendâs landlord has said âThat nââ will get shot if he wins.â  Itâs just going to get so much worse, the closer we get to the election, especially if Obama holds on to his leads in the polls against McCain. You realize, of course, that from the day Obama takes office to the day he leaves, no Faux employee will be allowed within 500 feet of the White House fence, much less in the press room.  Iâm still hoping for hate crime charges, if not incitement to riot. This is beautifully writtenâ¦If I had Fox News ethics Iâd steal it and use it on my own showâ¦ Hey, some rainbow trout are really excellent knitters! It would be really great if Obama showed up at a rally and said âNow let me introduce you to my Baby Mama.â While I donât watch TV news, how much sway does FOX NEWS really have?  Isnât it really just bias conformation?  How many independents watch FOX because the truly believe itâs âFair and Balanceâ? Maybe it is an elaborate ruse to distract people from any really issues. I canât help wondering what the foxes think of this. Then againâ¦ iâm with janiece. canât decide whether to firebomb something or brush it off. the professional scholars group, the association of genocide scholars, years ago recommended not debating with genocide deniers. just sharing a venue with deniers â simply arguing with them â gives them the academic standing they lack and which they crave. there is a good point in that. what if we all stopped watching, and talking about, the video gasbags? do you really think they believe any of this and theyâre not just hyping their ratings with scurrilities? On the whole âblack/biracialâ aspect â itâs that tension between self-identification and ascription that got Claire going, or so it seems to me. Of course the KKK would treat him as black.  And for political purposes, heâs going to be considered black.  Just like Iâm considered white or Hispanic, even though Iâm multiracial (Rosebud Sioux and Scottish). But that doesnât negate the complexity of his racial identification.  Heâs already acknowledged that heâs multiracial â but thatâs not going to get him very far in the simplistic American world of racial categorization.  So, yeah, heâs black â but remember thatâs a not-very-accurate label for who he is, necessitated by immediate circumstance. Donât get me wrong â I think the rest of your commentary is dead on, for reasons we already get â and those same reasons also support what Iâm trying to point out, here.  Fox News has always been at war with the truth, and weâve always been at war with Eastasia. Victor: âSo, yeah, heâs black â but remember thatâs a not-very-accurate label for who he is, necessitated by immediate circumstance.â I think your assessment is pretty accurate, actually. The crazy thing isnât whatâs happening on Foxnews. The crazy thing is that they are people who defend Foxnews. Fighting for a huge company who donât care about youâ¦ Itâs like these people defending McDonald against Morgan Spurlock! Isnât that a little bit retarded? Anything better to do with your life? If you want to fight for a cause, there are tons of them, just pick something.  For the rest, I donât like Foxnews so I donât watch it. Re: Dave Bell @#150: Wow, a Tank Vixens reference. Who woulda thunk? in the immortal words of Gypsy the Robot: âYikesâ¦just yikes.â Who thinks thatâs okay? I mean, seriously? And you know thereâd be a mass uproar if CNN referred to Cindy McCain as Johnâs âhoe,â which is basically what Fox news has done to Michelle Obama. David Harmon @ 146,
âday Obama takes office to the day he leaves, no Faux employee will be allowed within 500 feet of the White House fence, much less in the press roomâ I donât think you give Mr. Obama enough credit for the amount of class he has, or how intelligent he is.  He WILL let Faux News in, and will be able to give as good as he gets from them. I nominate Mr. Scalzi as his press secretary. Iâll bet Mr .Obama would let him conduct the press briefings from Ohio. In spite of the right-wing campaign smears, I think Mr. Obama will be the president of the whole countryâeven the red states.  So unlike our current idiot-in-chief. Fiona: âI nominate Mr. Scalzi as his press secretary. Iâll bet Mr .Obama would let him conduct the press briefings from Ohio.â Yeah, like I want a bunch of press vultures on my lawn. I love the sound of liberals wailing in the morning. Yes. It sounds like victory, it does. Although, I suspect, not for McCain. Scalzi: Yeah, like I want a bunch of press vultures on my lawn. If the press wants someone to tell them to get of his lawn, theyâll go cover McCain. Mr. Scalzi, You nailed it. This is the best commentary Iâve seen on the sorry little fiasco. Iâm the father of three, soon to be four, biracial children, and this kind of race baiting is an attempt to push us towards a future where they are _still_ viewed with suspicion and pigeonholed because of race. It can be subtle, like six-year-old white girls telling us sadly that they think our beautiful daughter would be prettier if her skin was a little lighter or her hair a little less curly. Thanks for spelling it out so clearly. John @ 158, I MEANT via video conferencing. Kodi would keep the media vultures well away, Iâm sure. Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein FOX NEWS. Das Offical Newstation of the Homeland! Would you like cheese with that whine? You didnât seem to have a problem when Bob Beckel called Tennessee Republicans âracist crackersâ on Fox News.  Did you write a whole column on that?  Somehow, I donât think so.
And Beckel remains a frequent pundit on Fox.  Did you voice your objection to his remarks? Or maybe you would like to show past columns where you slammed the left wing cartoonists for portraying Michale Steele as a lawn jockey or Condi Rice as Prissy from the movie, Gone With The Wind? It seems that you are only insensed when it is Obama who is slammed.  Not when a black Republican is slandered. Your hypocracy knows no bounds. SKar âNow if we could just generate this level of outrage when seated politicians call our soldiers murderers and terroristsâ¦â Citation please?  I seriously doubt that any politician not wearing a tin foil hat actually said that. Dear Mr. Scalzi, Where have you been all my life, or at least the past 7.5 years? Sincerely, A New Fan Shorter retire05: âYou donât complain about the things I think you should complain about, therefore youâre a hypocrite.â Well, you go with that, retire05. In the meantime, when I need your opinion about what I should write about, Iâll be sure to let you know. Donât wait up. âYour hypocracy knows no bounds.â â retire05 #165 Youâre spell-checker, on the other hand, doesâ¦. John in Chicago: Criticizing peopleâs spell-checking is fraught with danger and irony. I would like to think that Obama would have a bit more class once heâs in the Oval Office and will grant an occasional interview with FOX News. Nothing numbs the opposition further than being nice to them. Part of me wants them to bring out all the hateful racist stuff they can muster, turn the sky black with it, then LOSE. ThunderMonkey: Reminds me of the saying, âForgive your enemies; nothing annoys them more.â John, retire05 has a good point. If you really are upset about the racial aspects of this, you should be able to point to some past posted outrage at the blatantly racist treatment of Steele or Rice by liberals. Just sayâin. That still frame is bullshit. If that was for real, post a link  to an actual video of it. ANY 10 year old could photoshop some crap like that. Hell, why stop thereâ¦ Why not claim that fox called the Obamas âniggersâ and back it up with another photoshopped still frame from a broadcast that didnât happen? Bottom lineâ¦ Barack Obama is not a bad man, but he is NOT qualified to run a small business much less this country. Michelle Obama is the typical angry black woman. Read her college thesis. I read 25 pages of her racist rant against white people. Sheâs never been proud of America? How about during the civil rights movement? Black people all over the country are going to vote for him JUST BECAUSE HEâS BLACK!!!  No one even knows what this guy stands for. Just that heâs \black and that heâs a democratâ¦ but I guess thatâs all some of you need to know. Nevermind the fact that he has no experience and IS NOT QUALIFIED. But who caresâ¦ heâs blackâ¦ letâs go vote for him. Itâs like when I was a kidâ¦ some black kid would start shit with me, so I would proceed to kick his assâ¦ THEN EVERY OTHER BLACK GUY IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA WOULD JUMP IN THE FIGHT EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON. That is the perfect analogy to this presidential race. As for Fox Newsâ¦ Liberals only hate fox news because they tell both sides of the stories instead of YOUR side. How dare they tell people both sides of the story. Bullshit: âThat still frame is bullshit. If that was for real, post a link to an actual video of it.â Here you go. Donât you feel like the dumbass now. Now, please, remove your ignorant, sexist, racist jackassed self from my site. That still frame is bullshit. If that was for real, post a link to an actual video of it. ANY 10 year old could photoshop some crap like that.  Um, dude, Fox News apologized for it.  They wouldnât have apologized for something they didnât do, given how seldom they apologize anyway. As for the rest of your rant, I leave your racism to Mr. Scalzi to address, since this is his space. Love the commentary, Johnâ Iâll definitely be coming back to read more of your stuff.  Some of the comments here are truly disturbing, thoughâ¦.How come if you object to a news station calling the potential first lady a âbaby mama,â youâre automatically a tax-raisinâ gun banninâ baby killinâ atheistic socialistic red and green commie liberal?  How about youâre just, I donât know, not a complete idiot? Woops, sorry for feeding the troll, John. Hahaâ¦ that is awesome. I thought for sure that was some bullshit. Now that I know itâs for real I do apologizeâ¦ but it is funny as hell. As for ignorant, no I am not. I am well educated. My views may be different than yours, but âignoranceâ is not a word that anyone could even use to describe me. Sexistâ¦ maybe a little. [additional sexist commentary deleted â JS] Racist? Hardly. [additional racist discussion deleted. Hey, Bullshit, what part of âtake a hikeâ did you not understand? â JS] No worries, Cofax. But yes, in general when you see someone feculating in his own ignorance here, best just to avert your eyes and keep going. Save the responses for the people of good will and intelligence, on all sides of the discussion, who come here. [deleted because now Iâm bored with this jerk â JS] Well hey, at least his name was appropriate. Gretchen: Yes. The irony was he was using it to describe something else. Since weâre now attracting sexist, racist fucktards, this might be a good time to link to the comment policy. [deleted because this guyâs a boring asshole â JS] I feel that this an opportune time to remind people that according to the Program on International Policy Attitudes, Fox News viewers had a higher rate of misperceptions about the Iraq War than consumers of other media, and in general, Bush supporters were less likely than Kerry supporters to understand their own candidateâs policies. Gee, I wonder what Fux Noiseâs attitude would be if Obama was married to â I donât know â letâs say a Chinese woman.  Would it be OK to refer to her as a Chinkie? Maybe Rupert could give us his slant on that. Thank you for this.  Iâm e-mailing it to my friends.  The right will slander everything and everyone they do not understand, which is just about everything and everyone. This is the first time Iâve been on your blog.  I love your writing style. Thanks for keeping it real, dog.  ;-) Peace,
Brian Brian # 189 If you like his blog, read his books. Go pick up a copy of âOld Manâs Warâ you wonât be disappointed! âIn the meantime, when I need your opinion about what I should write about, Iâll be sure to let you know.â Whatever, and not covering all aspects of a subject makes you no more than the polical hack you are. But then, being objective doesnât seem to be part of your m.o., does it? Yes, it is your blog, and you are free under our Constitution to write whatever tripe you chose.  And readers are free to believe that you are what you are; non-objective, biased and not worth the time. Two Things: 1) John, that was brilliant so brilliant that I would be willing to be your baby mama if it werenât for that damned âYâ chromosome Iâve got. 2) Why is it that no one has called Michelle Malkin and Ann Coulter on what they really are: eye-candy for conservatives. Seriously, the only reason why either one of them has any following is because there are a lot of Republicans out there married to women who make Phyllis Schlafly look like Angelina Jolie. These guys arenât interested in what Malkin and Coulter have to say, theyâre just interested in fucking them. Seriously, if Michelle Malkin came over to their houses they wouldnât want to discuss immigration policy with her, theyâd just want her to put on a bar girl outfit and say âMe so horny G.I. Three holes, 20 dolla, happy ending! Bang! Bang!â. Really, is there anything else that explains why Ann Coulter, little miss conservative dresses like a high end call-girl on all of her book covers?    And this one from Coulterâs website, because you know that this is how conservative Republican women really dress.  retire05: âBut then, being objective doesnât seem to be part of your m.o., does it?â Nope. Never was. Youâll want to read that link, by the way, so you know why Iâm wholly unconcerned by your criticism. As a taster, and to quote myself: But I doubt that many of the people who want me to be âfairâ are actually asking for actual fairness, anyway. What they want is some sort of murmured polite dissent to whatever beef-witted thing they want to promulgate, something that implicitly suggests that their ideas have legitimacy and should be discussed reasonably among reasonable people. To which my response is: Well, no. Your opinion that whatever it is you want to foist on the world is reasonable does not mean that I have to agree, or treat it with the âfairnessâ you think it deserves. Rest assured that I am âfairâ to the extent that I give every idea I encounter the respect I think it rates. Hope that helps, retire05. And if you donât like it, you know where the door is. For those that think âFair and Balancedâ is remotely accurate please take a look at âManufacturing Consentâ. If however that takes too much energy, watch instead âWag the Dogâ. And pay particular attention to the fate of Dustin Hoffmanâs character. John, I guess I never really thought about all the benefits a person could get by being a minority attack dog like Malkin. Itâs justâ¦itâs hard for me to wrap my mind around for some reason. Maybe itâs because where I grew up, if a minority kid starting talking like Malkin does, the other minority kids wouldâve kicked her ass. I do think it is telling that the recent fucktard who posted here didnât let his admitted ignorance of facts affect his racist, sexist, fucktardist views. We arenât really dealing in logic here with some of these Fox fans. Jay53:
If you really are upset about the racial aspects of this, you should be able to point to some past posted outrage at the blatantly racist treatment of Steele or Rice by liberals. No, Jay, thatâs *not* a good point. The proper point of comparison for Fox News would be other major news networks â like ABC, CNN, MSNBC, etc. Find an equally racist comment regarding Steele or Rice on one of those networks. You canât? Maybe that would be because there isnât any. And thatâs one of the reasons why Fox is targetted here. Not only is the racism here blatant and revolting, itâs also unique in terms of the size of Foxâs audience and the scope of its national broadcast license/charter. . John the upside to having reporters in you front yard; you would save a bundle on fertilizer. I say Shame on Fox News! They are a disgrace to good journalism. Maybe itâs because where I grew up, if a minority kid starting talking like Malkin does, the other minority kids wouldâve kicked her ass. In your analogy, the minority kid is surrounded by a protective ring of really big, well-armed white kids. In return for shouting at the other minority kids, she is being allowed to tag along with them. Mythago: Aha. That is a very descriptive analogy, and I think it clears some stuff up for me. Thanks. Bravo Mr. Scalzi, bravo. That part where you dealt so harshly with that bullshit fellow?  You know, the ignorant, sexist, racist fucktard? That was cool. I shall have to buy Zoeâs Tale in hardback, it seems. Bravo, sir, bravo. Sickening. I heard about this secondhand, and hoped I was misunderstanding. I guess I wasnât. How the hell can that woman get away with that? How can FOX get away with that? They zapped the âterrorist fist bumpâ woman but they donât chastise Malkin for this outrageous, racist, sexist remark? It would be a better world if FOX News was swallowed up a la Poltergeist and none of us ever had to hear or see their pathetic âreportingâ again. I applaud you for your words, Mr. Scalzi! The enormity of ignorance displayed by Fox News, and not for the first time, is mind-boggling. They need to be called on it, and on a much higher level. I DO think that Mr. Obama, or perhaps Mrs. Obama, should look straight into the camera and ask Fox to defend their use of such volatileâ¦.umâ¦crap! Perhaps, as one poster suggested, it should be prefaced by introducing her as the âbaby mamaâ to kickstart the actual trashing of Foxâs much-less-than-professional journalism. Sure, it was supposedly a term used by âoutraged liberals,â in that screenshot, and as such is somehow easier to disown by Fox. But they know their viewership, and even if they werenât their words, they (as a âprofessional news organization), could have, and should have quoted some other pissed off liberal who ALSO wants people to get off Michelle Obamaâs back, in not so incendiary words. Having said that, I just donât understand people at all. You wrote a whole section of your post expaining why heâs black. Although he could be biracial. And all that. I never understood (and thus may be completely naive, but I hope not), why people are judged/viewed/denigrated based on the amount of melanin in their skin. (Uh oh â cliche coming, but heartfelt) Black, brown, white, red, yellow etc. Are we all not people? I will vote for Barack Obama in November because I feel he is the best candidate for the job, and have felt that way once all had thrown their hats into the ring. Thereâs just something about him that makes me think he could be the best President weâve had in many years. And donât we deserve that?? Oh!! To add to that. I think it is a GOOD thing that he hasnât been a career high-level politician! Heâs not as beholden to special interests that have consistently contributed. Heâs not as beholden to other Senators that might have traded this or that vote on the floor for a vote yet to be taken, or an on-going tit-for-tat while oneâs conviction slowly crumbles and one begins to acquiesce to the way the âsystemâ really works, and just becomes like the rest. Jaded and cynical? Who, me? I thought you might want to link to this site which was started by âwhat about our daughtersâ Itâs so clearly needed right now.
http://michelleobamawatch.com brilliant.  absolutely brilliant. How the hell can that woman get away with that? One of the few downsides of the rule of law is that itâs considered a no-no to tar, feather, horsewhip and run certain people out of town on a rail, no matter how much they deserve it. Well, John, youâve just gone from being my favorite new (relatively) science fiction writer to being one of my favorite people. Period. I liked it better when Malkin was organizing a boycott against the financial interest of the right-wing Carlyle Group over Rachel Rayâs wardrobe in a Dunkin Donuts commercial. I actually am at day 14 of the boycott. Thanks MM! Watch BigoTV.. @JGabriel # 136 fact check Yogi may or may not be smiling, but it isnât in Heaven. Heâs still alive. Tell it like it is! Fox sucks! Josh @145 I think my favorite part of the story was the end of the video where the anchor says (paraphrasing) âWe canât tell you the address of the field where the hateful, racist sign is, but we will tell you the intersection it is at. Since the guy who made it isnât going to take it down, you know what to do. *wink*â Youâre all Barking Moonbats. My ârespectâ for Mr. Scalzi has decreased dramatically over this rant. Iâll take the opinions of Michelle Malkin over any of your opinions. And I need to care what you think about me why? It always amuses me that people seem to think Iâm going to look at a comment like this and go âoh noes! I am not universally loved!â and, like, fall into a heap or something. Apparently lots of people donât realize that âkiss my assâ is one of my favorite expressions. If you want to value Malkinâs opinions over mine, fine by me. You have my pity, but hey, your life, man. Loser. Thatâs it. Iâm getting a T-Shirt that says âMoonbatâ. Iâm tired of this Neo-Con bigotry, so Iâm taking the word BACK people! Moonbats UNITE! (If, of course, by Moonbat, you mean âPerson who thinks differently than me since I get all my info from Rush Limbaugh and other Right-Wing Talking Point Pez Dispensers. Liberal hate! Traitors!â) You canât have the word back. We refuse to give it back. Ceroth: Youâre still not getting the whole âwho cares what you think?â concept, are you. Shall I use hand puppets to explain it? well said. Hand puppets?!  Now that is a video Iâd like to seeâ¦ :-).  Can you use the plastic dinos from the Creation Museum film? kw: Only if, during some point in the presentation, he uses the phrase âMine is an evil laugh!â Nicely done, as always. For the record, I would love for Bill OâReilly to refer to him as âmy nigga.â Not only would it end OâReillyâs unwarrantedly long run on Fox News, but it would potentially hand Obama millions of votes as he inevitably would laugh it off for a few moments before calmly and pleasantly delivering a verbal dismantling of OâReilly the likes of which we havenât seen since Lloyd Bentsenâs âYouâre No Jack Kennedy.â And I donât think even Bill O himself would dare cut off the mic of a presidential candidate. Wait, who am I kidding?  Of course he would.  It would be his last performanceâhe wouldnât go out with a bang, but with the bump sound of a mic going off live. Yep. Itâs part of this election and would have been regardless but it was a pity to first see it come from Democrats. I expect it from Fux and the GOP. Wile E Quixote@192: Your disgusting racist, sexist fantasies say a lot more about you than they do about conservative fans of Malkin and Coulter. If you disagree with M&C, and I hope that you do, engage with their ideas or ignore them. Donât describe them in abusive sexualized and racialized terms. Even if you think it doesnât count because youâre just projecting what conservatives âobviouslyâ think of them. Youâre still not getting the whole âwho cares what you think?â concept, are you. Shall I use hand puppets to explain it? âMy spleen! My liver!â Boss Scalzi around, get eaten by Elder Gods. Itâs just not worth it. Trackback: Odds and Sods (June 14) â Baltar is my prophet edition Oops, screwed that up. Ya know, if Blogger would do this automatically, I wouldnât have to do this the OLD FASHIONED WAY! Once more, with feeling: Odds and Sods â (June 14)- Baltar is my prophet edition PS:  GREAT POST. Epitomization of Asininity: Fox âNewsâ When will the dillweeds wise up and unplug from this crap? Excellent post John. As a Filipino, I would like to echo Natalie Maines and say that I am deeply ashamed that Ms. Malkin is Filipino. In the late 1990s I used to watch Fox Noise because of its novelty factor and because it was great way to watch a breaking news story live. But then its tabloid approach plus its incessant Clinton bashing turned me off them for good and blatant neocon propaganda turned me off them permanently. I think this brouhaha was some sort of comeback by someone at Fox Noise for what he/she thinks of as the martyrdom of E.D. Hillâs show by the forces of the âLiberal Mass Mediaâ. WORD! I really see no issue with this at all.  Its part of the lingo.  Seems to me everyone is being thin-skinned about this.  Its just politics.  Obama and Michelle are not off limits to this.  Both of them need to butch up and understand that its going to get much worse over the coming 5 months.  This wide-eyed, psuedo-innocent, selective outrage of Obama and his witless supporters is already silly.  And Iâm sure there is more silliness to come. Yup. Here we goâ¦. Criticize an Obamaâ¦ and you are a dirty racist!! At least FOX is speaking a language you sheep can understand. Getting the racial angle out of this, I also have to wonder if Malkin would lose her shit â as only Malkin can â if she was constantly referred to as âbabyâ or âgirlâ.  Where I come from, conservatives donât talk to, or about, grown women like theyâre children.  Not if they want to keep all their teeth. Itâs really sad that republicans actually agree with this crap on Fox News. Itâs quite sad really. Wow, it did take kind of a lot of comments for the racists to come slithering in, didnât it? Well, I did trim out some comments before, mythago. And as far as the ones at 233 and 234 are concerned, you can actually see their lips move as they read off their âyou liberals are so easily offendedâ note cards, so itâs hard to take them very seriously. MarkHB@2: Thatcher was black?!?!? Actually, if rainbow trout know something about knitting it would explain a lot about trout flies â¦ they sure go for some funny looking doodads. As for âBaby Mamaâ â¦ sheesh! Hmm.  All I can say is that from the posts I have read, everyone seems to be struck retarded.  As stupid as it was for Fox News to use that phrase (less likely as a racial epitaph than an attempt to be socially relevant) it is also moronic for the left to attack this as racist (since it is a term that is widely used by people both white and black).  The facts of the matter are, that Obamaâs presidency (for I believe that [barring some scandal] he will be the next president) is going to be defined by race even though his supposed goal was not to be so.  Anyone who disagrees with his policies will be tagged as a racist, while anyone who jumps on board without heavy backup for their position will be tagged as a racial panderer.  No issue will be truely addressed, but then again I suppose that we will have to have at least one racially motivated election/presidency before any legitimate candidate can be effective, and that is for either side. MarkHB@2: Thatcher was black?!?!? Ho ho ho, sharks.  But some of us whose memories last longer than 3.2 seconds remember when the conventional wisdom that âBritian isnât readyâ for a female leader of the opposition, let alone becoming Prime Minister.  Especially one whose gender and background was hardly that of the stereotypically upper class, Eton-Oxford educated Tory toff. Yo! Fox news just being down with it! Keepinâ it real! Showinâ off deys street cred wit da hip hop lingo. Afta all, Obama did da same with the rightous Rev Wright for tweny years bro! Sheeeeet! Fox News must be like da the furst white boys to say âbaby mamaâ after like a millon bruthers n sisters. Dem crazy blue eyed devilsâ¦dey always rippinâ off hip hop stylinâ. Nex thang u know, Fox News be callinâ Obamaâs baby mamaâs weddinâ ring, bling!
Fight da power! Where be ma 40 acres an mule? Aaron@240: Not only have you completely missed the reason why this was a racist insult, you seem to have some odd ideas about what makes a phrase racist.  Iâll give you an example of how silly your arguments sound, using the word âboyâ: it is âwidely used by people both white and black,â and âObamaâs presidency â¦ is going to be defined by race,â so if a major television news outlet referred to Mr. Obama as âthat boy,â it would be moronic to attack that as racist.  Never mind that, as a grown man, Mr. Obama is obviously not a âboyâ in the usual sense of âvery young male,â and there is a well-known usage of the word by racists to belittle black men. Along the same lines, âXâs baby mamaâ is typically used to describe a woman who has had a child by X without marrying him.  This meaning plainly doesnât fit Mrs. Obama, so why use it?  Mr. Scalzi explained this quite clearly, and Iâm not sure how you missed it. Ah, wait, I see it now.  Iâve noticed your use of âhis supposed goal,â and â[a]nyone who disagrees with his policies will be tagged as a racist, while anyone who jumps on board without heavy backup for their position will be tagged as a racial panderer.â  Perhaps you are one of those people who are so tired of all this racism, so weary of the inevitable use of the ârace card,â that you simply cannot stomach any talk of race, even when it is to decry legitimate instances of racist nonsense.  If that is the case, save the wear and tear on your keyboard and go have a nice lie down. LOL!  Iâm not sure if someone has commented on this already, but Obama would tell folks in southern Illinois that his named rhymed with âyo mamaâ (recent WaPo article). Obviously, he was trying to say he was black as Satan to anger Scalzi. What a load of rubbish.  Why donât you just admit you have a crush on Obama and make a YouTube video with you running around in high-heels and underwear? JB, yet another subscriber to the âObama once said this one thing about himself, so itâs perfectly okay for Fox News to say this completely other, racist thing about his wifeâ line of thinking. Did a site filled with especially unthinking conservatives just link in? They do seem to be a bit thicker on the ground here in the last day. Get over your obsession with race. Fox News first. John, Iâm not a conservative, but is it racist for Obama to say that or for his wife to describe him as her babyâs daddy? Maybe Iâm missing something, but the Obamas seem to want to embrace African-American culture when it suits them (think Trinity) and then distance themselves from it when it doesnât (think Trinity again). If Fox was running this continuously for weeks, it would be a bit ridiculous, but for a day?  Itâs mirthful and does riff on the rhyme with âmamaâ and âObamaâ.  People will never be comfortable in their own skin (whatever pigment it is) if they canât learn to laugh at the little things.  Thatâs one area where the gay community has excelled.  Instead of getting offended by every stereotype and comment, they embrace them and turn them into comedy. For what itâs worth, people who get easily offended, offend me.  There are plenty of real things to be upset about.  This is making a mountain out of a molehill. JB: âIf Fox was running this continuously for weeks, it would be a bit ridiculous, but for a day?â Well, and there was the thing right before that, with the âterrorist fist jab.â And the thing before that, where the Fox  News commentator openly hoped for Obama to get assassinated. And then thereâs the whole âBarack Hussein Obamaâ mantra. So, yeah, actually, Fox has been doing this sort of crap for weeks, JB. And sure, they apologize for it all after it happens, but by then the dog whistle has been blown and all right ears have been perked up. Itâs possible, of course, that a news organization with an open and obvious bias toward the GOP just keeps doing these sort of things unintentionally â that their folks are so completely clueless that it doesnât occur to them what fuck-ups they are until after the fact. But after a certain point it begins to be reasonable to wonder how many clueless fuck-ups Fox News should get to have before you can point to a legitimate campaign to discredit a Democratic candidate through innuendo, fear-mongering and racism. But if you want to think itâs just a one-time thing, JB, you go right ahead. There are a lot of people who seem to think all of these things are just a âone timeâ sort of thing, if only because Fox News and its fellow travelers are generally smart enough to avoid going for the same smear twice, and because a lot of people either donât want to connect the dots, or arenât capable of doing so. John great post. I think the right wing wackos are linking through Kos. The trolls from there will filter down to a few less well known blogs to try the rush/malkin talking points to a new audience. LOL pitiful Maybe Iâm missing something No, I donât think youâre missing anything; youâre just choosing to portray yourself as Mr. Easygoing, which requires you to brush aside Fox Newsâs use of a racist insult to, essentially, call Michelle Obama a whore.  If youâd find it âmirthfulâ to hear somebody call your wife names on public television, I guess thatâd be your problem. Me, Iâm offended at people who think itâs their business to go around telling others to STFU and grab their ankles whenever a bigotâs lips start flapping. Do try to learn the difference between laughing at oneself, and laughing at insults directed at oneself by others. Iâm not even going to get into the irony of your paying homage to the mythically un-offendable gay community after your suggestion that John go around in high heels and underwear on a YouTube video. Mixed feelings much? See, I canât see the point in being outraged. Or upset or anything. This is AMERICAN politics, the childrens playland of politics, its how it is. Politically, this country sucks as much as it is possible to suck. Its downright SHAMEFUL. Yes, FoxNews said something they should not have  said and blah blah blah. But theyâre just acting as a voice for one part of the American people and behaving the way most American people do. No use being upset at them, if they say something bad, heres an asinine idea, ignore them. Jesus Christ, people. Grow the fuck up. Donât you have better things to do, like raise kids, expand your mind and own horizons? (Iâm not aiming at the people at this site or anything, but people who make way too big a deal about things in general.) BTW, I donât pay attention to FoxNews or any other news organization because they fail to actually report any news. I have no bias against any particular one, just all of them. :P Did anyone else find it funny (in a how can they be so stupid way) that the clip that John linked to in #176 has Michelle Malkin saying that criticism of Michelle Obama is OK as long as it is relevant and not just an insult (which is something I agree with BTW) seconds after the offensive message appeared on screen. John, as Iâm sure you are aware, you really nailed it this time. First of all: PROUD to be a Barking Moonbatâ¦ Want the T-Shirtâ¦ Second: John, your commentary on how Obamaâs racial makeup will be seen by anyone who cares in EITHER direction was the most insightful part of the piece. What you said was not an opinion but a logical conclusion based on actual observation of the racial issues that exist in the real world. So add a bravo from meâ¦ Third: (From upstream) Of course President Obama will allow Fux News into the briefing room. In fact, he would be smart to give them a reserved seat in the front row, and call on them every time they raise a handâ¦ After all, they will provide PERFECT opportunities for the Press Secretary to make whatever points they are trying for that day, since the Fux questions will provide excellent jump-off points for logical rebuttals to any inane neo-Con-fucktard  objections. With Fux playing straight man, the Administration wonât be able to loseâ¦ PS: John, will you please reconsider your rejection of the position of Press Secretary? Since Jon Stewart is going to be VP, that means itâs either you or we have to recruit the ghost of Tim Russert (RIP Timmy!!!)â¦ John, âDog whistleâ?  Are you the one now calling people animals? So all those are part of some grand conspiracy to tell people what exactly?  Obama is black, Hussein is his middle name, and that his supporters like to cry a lot?.  I have news for youâ¦things are going to get a lot rougher.  If that is too tough for Obama, then he should not be running for president. mythago, Have you ever heard of Obama girl?  Are you really that ignorant to not get that reference? So Michelle was calling Barak a âwhoreâ (your word) when she referred to him as her âbabyâs daddyâ? Please go buy a clue or steal one from somebody who has one. Ummmâ¦ JB? Look up the meanings of bothâ¦ they are not the sameâ¦ Baby Mama is much more derogatory and âwhoreâ is one of the connotationsâ¦ Mythago has a huge clueâ¦ let me snip off one tiny corner of it for youâ¦ Skipping all of the comments to simply say:  I love you. Why, thank you, Reba! Johnâs pretty cool tooâ¦ What a load of rubbish. Why donât you just admit you have a crush on Obama and make a YouTube video with you running around in high-heels and underwear? And more:
Have you ever heard of Obama girl? Are you really that ignorant to not get that reference? I got the reference, JB, but itâs funny that when you wanted to insult Scalzi thatâs where your mind went.  (Personally, I wouldnât mind seeing Mr Scalzi in hooker drag twirling around a pole, but Iâm just perverted that way.)  Johnâs not a real man now â heâs some silly little fluff-head with a man-crush? Where I come from, we have a saying â when youâre in a hole, the first thing to do is stop digging. But I am going to disagree with our host on one thing:
Itâs possible, of course, that a news organization with an open and obvious bias toward the GOPâ¦ Really, and when did Senator Clinton flip parties? The likes of Coulter, OâReilly and Sean Innanity donât seem to be terribly keen on the presumptive GOP nominee. :) Craig, My mind went to the empty-headed girl who puts her Obama crush video on YouTube where she prances around not wearing much while telling us all that she thinks Obama is great.  Iâm insulting Scalzi because of his knee-jerk defense of Obama and getting so holier-than-thou offended  at minor things.  Scalzi like Obama girl and countless others seem to project their fantasies on Obama like he is the second-coming.  It would be amusing if it wasnât so sad. JB: Yes, Iâve been nothing but a slavering Obama fanboy from day one. JB, weâve established that you think that the snarky racism of a major news organization is kicky innocent fun, and weâve also established you havenât the first clue about anything about me, and between the two of these, I think weâve also established youâre a bit of an asshole. I think youâve accomplished all you came for in this thread, donât you? Time to wrap things up, which is to say, youâre done here now. Move along. To ensure you do move along, youâre in the moderation queue, so anything you try to post will have to go through me first. If you try to post in this thread again, youâll just be wasting your time. WowâI was linked to this via a bb. Great pithy and scathing rant about poor excuse for information that is Fox News. I confess I am confounded by Ms Malkinâhow does she sleep at night? As for Obama, I was a Hillary supporter and have some regrets that the nom is not her. But Obama is a more than adequate candidate (their positions were fairly similar). I am proud to have the junior senator from my state be the nominee and will be voting for him in November. I am thinking of starting a poolâwhat stereotype will Fox pull an âoops!â about next? Will Obama be found to fear cats? Will he be seen in footage eating watermelon? Will Michelle start to wear bling? Iâm breathless with anticipation! Is it this blog or do the conservatives who have posted here just not make much sense? The dearth of critical thinking skills is a bit dismayingâ¦. Yâknow, I really, really, really resent the appendage of the noun âNewsâ after the network name âFox.â  It is as demeaning to news as Fox is to blacks. And, JB, like John Iâm hardly one of those âObama cultistsâ you hear so much about â but FFSâ¦  Iâm slightly to the right of Orson Scott Card and Larry Niven, and Fox is just turned into some embarrasing vision of what would happen if Judd Apatow was put in charge of a cable news network.  Then again, Iâm being unfair to Mr. Apatow â he doesnât pretend his salacious frat-boy drivel is hard news. But, being a glass half-full kind of guy, at least weâve been spared the degraded and degrading spectacle of Clinton facing off against Mitt Romney or Mike Huckabee. Eleanor: âIs it this blog or do the conservatives who have posted here just not make much sense?â This blog has a number of conservative commentators who make excellent and challenging comments when I post about politics, actually, and Iâm happy about that. This thread has a bit more noise than most comment threads because itâs been so widely linked. and getting so holier-than-thou offended at minor things That is the LAST time I am bringing my irony detector onto the Internet. Damn thing keeps overloading. JB, if you can hear us down there in the moderation queue: See, this is a written medium. Itâs a little hard to pretend you misheard, or deliberately misspeak and hope nobody caught it. So when you pretend that you thought the Fox News headline was âbabyâs mamaâ rather than âbaby mamaâ, you get your pick of whether youâre confessing to be sloppy or a bad liar. Or both, if youâre feeling robust. re Fox News, I guess Iâm disappointed that the dogwhistle is so, well, amateurish. Lee Atwater must be rolling in his grave. I like the term âFox pasâ
adj â describing an action or statement stupid enough to be worthy of Fox News, as in âWow, what a Fox pas the âbaby mamaâ comment was!â Eleanor @ 263: I am thinking of starting a poolâwhat stereotype will Fox pull an âoops!â about next? Will Obama be found to fear cats? Will he be seen in footage eating watermelon? Will Michelle start to wear bling? Iâm breathless with anticipation! Well, the 4th of July is right around the corner, so there is a good chance they might catch him eating fried chicken AND watermelon on the same day! Oh, but wait, I forgot â he hates America (as evidenced by the lack of a flag pin on his lapel) so he probably wonât be celebrating her birthday. </snark> As for FAUX News and the idiots who try to defend them, I would simply point out the sage comment of Ron White: âYou canât fix stupid!â BTW, John â great post! What does Fox News really stand for? Fascist, Outragous, Xenophoia news. They were the cheerleaders of the war on Iraq and attacked anyone who disagreed with the administration. The comments on âbaby mamaâ falls under the outragous area. This is a way of changing the topic by being outragous and diverting the publicâs attention away from real issues. While F.O.X. says Iâm sorry it wonât happen again until the next time, and so it goes on and on and on. The issue with FOX is a global problem that modern democracy still hasnât cracked: what to do when a major â4th estateâ, unaccountable news organization decides to pull out all the stops in pursuing a political agenda. Itâs the same in Italy (dominated for almost 15 years by a media magnate), in UK (where Murdoch and the tabloids pretty much set the agenda) and to a certain extent even in Spain and France. You canât match Fox and its ilk on a outrage-by-outrage basis: thatâs exactly what they want. In pointing out the âscandalâ, you are publicizing their views even better than they could on their own. By reporting or criticizing their message, you are amplifying their dog-whistling. By pointing out their racism, youâre bringing back racism as the topic of this campaign, which it really shouldnât be at this time in history (unless you enjoy living in a country that in less than a decade has lost any international credibility whatsoever and is quickly losing all its economic power as well, bringing its long-time allies down with it). At the same time you canât really ignore them, because theyâll go on building their popularity unchallenged, brainwashing the âfaithfulâ like poor Charles above. If you try imposing fairness through legislation, they will scream censorship (and I agree itâs a slippery slope). If you build independent state-run media, they will be âoccupiedâ after the first electoral victory.
In a way, these ânewsâ outlets are the worst type of internet trolls: they took over the board (more than 20 years ago), there is no moderator, and you canât move to a new forum. Up to now, Obama has been good in keeping these factors out of the race, but his audience was naturally limited. Now he has to deal with the full power of the meme-machines, and Iâm curious about how heâll choose to respond, mainly because I wouldnât know how to respond either. Up to now his tactic seems to be to let media storms settle on their own, while addressing the points of merit a bit later; it seems to work, albeit not perfectly (especially when even âfriendsâ are determined to exploit their 15 minutes of exposure).
In a way, he tries to  starve the noise-machine; you, John, are feeding it. A clarification I canât help offering (though I know Iâve missed my moment), especially re 111, 140: Black and biracial are not mutually exclusive categories. The same person can quite easily identify as both. While there *are* many people identifying as âbiracial but not blackâ and refusing to be identified as black or to check the âAfrican-Americanâ box on census forms, etc, this approach is not the only way to embrace a biracial identity. And of course, the use of biracial to mean only black/white is sloppy and inaccurate, if clear enough in this context. Many commenters seemed confused on this point (John Scalzi, I suspect you arenât, but the post did set it up as an either/or question). Dance: Indeed, I do think people do see it as either/or. Fox News was wrong to use that sort of language, which I take was the producers decision, and not some vast right wing conspiracy there. Michelle Malkin, didnât have anything to do with what was displayed on the screen, so taking this out on her is sort of misplaced.  She constantly gets hate mail calling her far worse than âbaby mama.â Now, personally, like just about every commentator out there, sometimes MM and AC are on and get it right. Sometimes they are way in right field and their rhetoric is a hindrance to the point they are making. And itâs interesting that many of the same people who are decrying this particular kerfluffle, donât have any problem spouting bigoted rhetoric about conservatives, republicans, or Christians. Giacomo @ 272: âIf you try imposing fairness through legislation,â And how do you define fairness when most issues have more than 2 sides to it.  Something that to many people seem to forget. I have to wonder what everyone thinks of the Mark Steyn trial up in Canada.  How many people are in favor of anti-hate speech laws? Yawn. People who comment just write something like âyawnâ: Yawn. Keith Indy @ 275: Anti-hate speech laws? I live in Sweden (donât klick my name unless you speak Swedish) and we have them. Itâs forbidden to say bad things about Jews, homosexuals and a few other groups. I think the whole group idea is stupid. Why would it be more illegal to claim that all homosexuals will burn in hell, than to claim that all heterosexuals will burn in hell? Iâd much prefer a system where the basis for whether a comment is illegal or not is if it harmed the targeted individual. Wait â weâre afraid of CATS now??? (I swear, this year I have learned more anti-black stereotypes than I ever heard of in nearly 35 years of actually being black.  Also new to me: we canât swim and are addicted to grape soda??!  Butâ¦ why is this black?  Grape soda is mediocre after age eight, and swimming is good times.) At first I thought the cat thing was supposed to be a Hitler joke. :-/ Say, Macâ¦ If youâre not going to finish that Nehi, would you toss it across the pool to me? Keith @275: note that I said that, at this point, is basically impossible to legislateâ¦ but if one had to try, he should consider this: âfairâ is not âequidistantâ nor âbalancedâ. Fairness should be as close to truth as possible, which is difficult to do, but not impossible. Note that the US indeed used to have legislation pushing in that direction, and it was abolished by âprogressiveâ representatives, which in the long run resulted in a worse standard of reporting. The way to hell is paved by good intentionsâ¦ @edward, #280 â  I would be pleased as punch to share my Nehi with your bad moonbat self. ;-)   (I will be over here in my floaty chair, sipping my icy-cool homemade sorrel drink.  Try it!) i say carry on! THANK YOU, THANK YOU & THANK YOU!!!!  For giving me a laugh from this sad BS commentary that we all must sit through day after day.  I know its been gettinâ on my last nerve too.  And you summed it up nicely when you said it was all an attempt to remind folks that heâs black.  They are screaming loud and clear = Stop!!  Stop reacting to him as an intelligent and educated man!  Stop!!  Stop reacting to him as a family man that loves his wife and cares for his children!!  Stop!!  Stop reacting to him as a man that has proven his passion for serving the community and ALL people!!  No, no, no!!  Remember that heâs a BLACK man so that trumps all that âtreat and respect him like the human being he isâ crap!!  Sheeesh!! My two cents, The Sauda Voice
http://www.thesaudavoice.com He, and she, are exactly as they portray them. Osama hates whites, America, freedom, prosperity, and free will. He is a communist, along with Nancy Pepsi cola, and all the other great thinkers on their so called dream team. Do you like being told what to do, how to heat, and cool your home, what to drive, what light bulbs to use, even if they are unsafe, what, if any health care you will get, and how much YOU will pay for it, oh, and Osama sayâs we are to stupid to do our own taxâs, so he will send us a pre paid tax, or, um, prepared return? Is this what you want, or would you rather make some decisions on your own, like the adults you are supposed to be. I donât like anyone telling me what to do, or how to live my life, most people donât, just the weak like it, it makes them feel safe, and cuddly. Gee, John, are you trolling your own boards now, calling yourself âWarriorâ and showing just how ridiculous actual right-wing arguments are? Donât you get enough posters? Mac: When I was in the Navy, we had plenty of black men with us in basic training. On Swim Day, the first thing most (not all) said was âBrothers donât swim!â Iâd never heard such a thing before. Sure enough â I donât remember many of them swimming well, or really much at all. (Full disclosure, I donât swim so well either â but I was not part of a group who stereotyped themselves as not swimming and then proved it.) Ever since then, whenever I see black men involved in some activity where they are immersed in water somehow, I immediately flash back to that âBrothers donât swim.â moment, and to my great chagrin, I rarely see many that do. I donât know if Iâm just noticing it because of my past experience, or if indeed many black men prefer not to swim. Keep in mind Iâve never thought black men âcouldnâtâ swim, just that they seem to prefer not to, generally speaking. (Swimming is not the same as cooling off in the pool. Iâm not sure if Iâve ever met anyone who does not enjoy that.) @287âEnlisted basic training?  Swimming is a class marker, and it perpetuates, because parents teach children how to swim. The reviews for this book suggest that municipal pools in some neighborhoods were closed rather than integrate. There are a number of socio-economic factors that add up to âbrothers donât swim!â I think the fact that my dad was born and grew up two seconds from a beach in the West Indies is probably a factor. :-)  Not swimming was never even entertained as an option. I was tossed in at age three. (This is why I like to draw distinctions between âblackâ  and âAfrican American,â âCaribbean,â and all those other diaspora subgroups, sometimes.  As well as âAfrican From Africa,â as itâs coming to be called, ha ha.  In terms of culture at least.) Hmmm â another factor being just how landlocked a person is.  I suppose the odds are pretty high, considering our geography, that these guys werenât on a coast and HAD to rely on a public pool. (But I still love my kitty and grape soda is yucky. Give me tea, Earl Grey, hot. ;-D) Corby Kennard, You attack me for my view, and say Iâm a ridiculous right-wing nut. What in the hell does your racist comment about blacks canât swim have to do with this topic. You are like all the other Libâs. Shoot off your mouth for 10 minutes, and say nothing. You, a Dem, Lib of all people, should not be talking racist. You are the first people to bring up race, and attack anyone else that speaks about Osamaâs color. I didnât say anything about his color, and could care less if he were purple. HEâS STILL A RED COMMUNIST, AND AN IDIOT, MORON, just like you. Warrior, calm yourself or youâll be calmed involuntarily. Likewise, and again, everyone should try to avoid personal attacks. Donât make me get out the stick. And from here on out the stick will be applied without warning. AAaauummm, AAaauumm, AAaauumm. Meditation is good to calm ones self. I feel better already. Yoga works also. Excellent. Thank you. Ya know I saw this almost word for word on the daily show last week. Iâll have to return with a link from hulu. Iâll admit that the headline made me cringe, but donât miss the irony: Itâs the liberals that want to treat Michelle like BHOâs âbaby mama.â Because, you know, if thatâs all she was, she WOULD be irrelevant  to the campaign, and not newsworthy at all. âLeave her alone! Thatâs not nice! Sheâs just his baby mama after all!â But (and this point has already been well made) as it stands, she is his wife of many years, and an active campaigner and speaker on his behalf. Warrior: Do you truly believe Obama is Communist? If so, why? Warrior, without cogent arguments to support your thesis re: Obamaâs status as a communist, racist and hater of all things American, you wonât be taken seriously by any thinking person, whether that person be conservative or liberal.  Hence the perception that you are a âridiculous right-wing nut.â Evidence to support your arguments would also be nice. Hehe. Warrior â I donât believe I was talking to you about the swimming thing. I also donât believe it is racist to acknowledge race. I think most âminoritiesâ would rather you acknowledge whatever makes them a minority rather than ignore it, and appreciate those differences. As to the content of my comment â I believe I was remarking on the stereotype and how, sometimes, no matter how much one hates it, it seems to be, if not wholly true, to have the absurd ring of truth, at least in one personâs experience. This is not to say that I believe, for example, that black men (to accede to Mac, of any persuasion: Caribbean, African, etc) are unable to swim, and indeed are afraid of the water. I believe my whole point was that I have had the odd experience of seeing this specific stereotype in action. I believe we all have at one point or another experienced a stereotype come to life â and if you are any kind of human you probably think two things at once: 1) Holy crap, what a stereotype! and 2) Oh crap â a stereotype. I think those reactions are completely human. What WOULD have been racist, Warrior, was if I would have said something along the lines of âStupid (racial epithet) canât (some action) cause they are (some color/sexual orientation/gender)â and then laughed at them. Perhaps that is what you heard from my comment â but the person I was speaking to â again, Mac â apparently understood my point and was even informative and interesting when he did so. Iâm sorry you didnât get that. Iâve heard some people comment that theyâd love to see Michelle Obama make a bid for the White House at some point. A part of me snickers at the thought of what Fox âNewsâ and other like-minded people think of THAT idea. Another part of me cringes at the thought of a repeat of this past Democratic race- with all the horrible sexist comments thrown at Hiliary, and racist comments about Obama- only this time, all those racist/sexist comments are thrown in conjunction, at the same candidate. Iâd love to see the US progress to the point where nobody thinks twice about electing a president, without race, sex, gender, orientation, religion, and all those other prejudicial issues getting in the way of the issues that matter. Politics isnât about politics as much as itâs about the politician, and thatâs disheartening. When I read the postâs portion on racial identity, I read his comments to mean that no matter what one chooses to identify oneself as, society will always see you primarily as the race your phenotype most resembles. My ancestry includes Lumbee Native American along with latino, but when people see me they see me as black and treat me as a black woman. I think that is the point. Yeah, we know Obama is biracial, but as to the way he is treated by the media and society, he is a black man.
I know that many african americans who are multiracial can understand thisâhow you can fully aware of your diverse heritage but still primarily identify yourself as black and grow up within the identity of a black person. Anyway, loved the rant and I passed it onto many of my friends. It was really spot on. How I loathe Fox News and their self-hating minority hand puppets. Lets find a media outlet that isnât biased one way or another.  Oh wait, there isnât one. Anonymous and Carol Elaine, Sorry, Iâve been busy, but to answer your question, first, anyone who wants more goverment control, in what ever sector, is on the communist side of thinking. Read Maoâs little Red book if you want to know the truth, and how they, The Demâs, are using this propaganda. My wife grew up under Maoâs rule, and knows first hand, and told me how it was during Moa, and after Mao. Obama says more taxâs, what will you do about it. He sayâs national health, and you will be paying 50% to 70% tax, what will you do about it. He sayâs you canât heat your home at 72, what will you do about it. He sayâs you canât drive your SUVâS, what will you do about it. He sayâs illeagal immagrants will have free school, medical, meals, etc., and your taxâs will pay for it, what will you do about it. I could go on, and on. The only people that like him, are, just like in China, with Mao, the ones that have nothing, and donât want to work for anything, and want the other people trying to improve, to be on the same level, and get no more than they. I donât want anyone telling me how, or what, or when to live my life, let alone be taxed for it. As for Carol Elaine, again, I say read Maoâs little Red book, and you will be educated. It is the base for the government as it is becoming under Dem control, and the New change under the Dem, Obama, and his gang. I think, as a rational, real life, normal person, not one of your Lib thinkers, that I am adult enough to decide what is good for me, and donât need some power hungry morons to run my life, and make me pay for them to protect me, because I am not able to. My God, the things they have said, and done in the last 6 or so months, makes me sick. You have to admit, they have some new idea almost every week, on how to control us, and everything else in America, from big business, to what light bulbs you will be able to use. You are probably not old enough to know what it was like growing up in the 60âs and 70âs, to have anything to compare today with, but I did, and see that as the rest of the world has become more free, America has become more communistic. The Demâs, and all in government here in America, if the truth be known, really want communisum, and total control, but the trick is doing it, without the rest of the world catching on. Oh, America the free wants communisum, it canât be, but in fact, thatâs what the Dem, Lib, Obama, and Nancy, and Teddy, and Kerry, and Gore, and all the rest of your thinkers want, total CONTROL, and you are all being fed this crap propaganda, and being manipulated into their little plan. They start with, oh the poor need health care, the polar bear is going to vanish, and on, and on, and make one new law after another, until you have, COMMUNISUM!!!!! Wake up, before you are equal, and have no reason to improve your lives, and you walk around in a daze bumping into walls, because you are unable to think for yourself anymore. Sorry if shocked anyone, but Iâm sure you can get some free treatment from some government shrink if you need to heal. Obama, and his gang could save alot of time, by just printing Maoâs little red book in english, and calling it My guide to change, and hope for America, and giving it to every American, and demanding they follow its rules. GOVERNMENT CONTROL = COMMUNISUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!

GOVERNMENT CONTROL = COMMUNISUM!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sorry, I hit submit befor I listed a name. Its me, Iâm Baacckk.. Corby Kennard, I donât really care what you said, and might not think you are being racist, but if you ask a black person what they think about it, well, they would say you are a white racist. I think most blacks are more racist, than whites. They can say what ever they want, but you better not say anything in reply, or you are a racist. Opra is one of the biggest racist I have seen, but she is put up on her soap box every day to tell us how to live. I work with blacks, and mexicans, and asians, and whites, and we say what we want to one another, and bash each others race in fun, and no one gets offended, but go out on the street, and you will be arrested for the same thing. All races have been wronged over time, and no one is owed anything because of it. It is past, way past, and people should get on with their lives. John Scalzi, after your comment #249, I think you should have the stick taken to you. You should be ashamed, and go stand in the corner. FREEDOM is what its all about. What made this country great, and why everyone wants to come here. Donât try to change it, take it away, or destroy it, or all you thinkers will be in for a great shock, and wake up, and it will be to late. Warrior, anyone who was actually married to a victim of Maoâs tyranny would not be stupid enough to compare that horror to Obama. Câmon, man, Scalzi picks more convincing trolls out of his dryer lint trap. A part of me snickers at the thought of what Fox âNewsâ and other like-minded people think of THAT idea.  Did you know that sheâs had two childrenâ¦.with a BLACK MAN?!?! mythago, You know nothing about it, just what you have heard through propaganda. I am married to a victim, as you put it, and have been told many stories, and have been to China many times.  I am not saying Obama is as horrific, but is wanting to take us there one step at a time. They will do it in stages so that we might not catch on before it is to late. As for day in, and day out normal life while in China, I felt I had more freedom in Shanghai, than I do here. Sad, isnât it. As I said before, read Maoâs little red book, and maybe go to China, then talk as if you know something about the subjet of communisum. We are headed that way, and being sold out for greed, and power. I canât understand how educated people can fall for the crap being spread around. Can you not see your freedom being taken away, or in the works to be taken away? Thatâs all that matters, not who, or what party is doing it, just that it be stopped, before it is to late. So if some one wants to call me a âridiculous right-wing nut.â, so be it, but I am right about the above statement no matter what side you are on. âAll races have been wronged over time, and no one is owed anything because of it. It is past, way past, and people should get on with their lives.â Yes, I remember my gramps telling me about the days when whites were considered property, or the days when they couldnât vote, routinely got hanged from trees for looking at black women the wrong way, or when blacks made them ride in the back of the bus and use separate bathrooms. âThatâs all that matters, not who, or what party is doing it, just that it be stopped, before it is to late.â I donât get it.  Are we supposed to vote Canadian? I like that the news is making this election about talking about NOT talking about the candidatesâ wives.  I guess weâre either supposed to vote for the one whose wife didnât say the dumbest thing or the one who didnât bring it up repeatedly that the wife said dumb things. Marko â Blacks were not the first and only enslaved race, just the most recent.  And by comparison to ethnic cleansing, they didnât have it that bad. Warrior: âJohn Scalzi, after your comment #249, I think you should have the stick taken to you. You should be ashamed, and go stand in the corner.â What makes you think I care what you think, Warrior? Also, please aggregate multiple responses in a single post, if you please. Too many posts in sequence from the same person annoys me. Marko, I suppose we owe you for what happened in the past. No one is alive today that had anything to do with slavery, just as no one is alive that had anything to do with the Jewâs, and the Japanese being put into camps. The Chinese slave trade, and prostitution here in America. What about the treatment of the Indian;s here in America. The Irish, the Italianâs being treated as scum when they immigrated here, and they were white. Shall I go back to when the Romans raped, killed, and enslaved WHITES back in the past. How much time must pass before people move on. No other race continues to act as if they are owed for this, and no other race continues to cry about it. Why not show that they were wrong, and make something of yourself, instead of crying poor me all the time. I would say if anyone, the Indianaâs should have been given more help, seeing as we invaded their land, an took it all from them. And John Scalzi, I think I hit a nerve with you also. And  Baffled, what I mean, is, it doesnât matter who you vote for, just vote for the party that is Pro American, not communist, like the Dem,s are. I would vote for Bob Barr if I thought he could win, he is what we need, less government, and less taxâs, how can you argue for the side that wants government control of your lives. I am not here just to bash Dem,s. I would bash anyone for government control of my life, and trying to destroy America from the inside. Warrior: âAnd John Scalzi, I think I hit a nerve with you also.â Aside from annoying me with multiple serial comments, no, not really. @ 298  Hehe. Warrior â I donât believe I was talking to you about the swimming thing. I also donât believe it is racist to acknowledge race. I think most âminoritiesâ would rather you acknowledge whatever makes them a minority rather than ignore it, and appreciate those differences. Yes, that! (FYI, Iâve always found âI donât think of you as blackâ to be one of the more terribly hurtful things people have said to me. Like, what do you think âblackâ means that you donât want to associate it with me? Why are you ignoring a major part of who I am?  Why is âblackâ a negative thing that must be Not Spoken Of?) I found Corby Kennardâs statement to be a simple anecdote of facts that took place, and things he was told, not a racist statement. In fact, Iâm rather baffled at how they could be interpreted as such.  He reported what happened â he didnât even draw conclusions, just analyzed his own attitudes. (I also enjoy speaking for myself, thenk yew, as opposed to being represented by generalized assumptions, or speaking for others.) Making race a taboo topic feeds into ignorance, and it makes people resentful when their legitimate questions and curiosity are silenced and they are made to feel guilty for things that should not cause guilt.  Differences exist, in physicality and in experience â noticing this isnât evil. Treating others as inferior based on the difference is whatâs evil.  In my humble opinion. ;-) I thought Iâd be going back to a post way dead by now but apparently this post lives on. I was just playing on wordle.net and decided to put in your post on the Obamas (it was beautiful by the way) and it was so perfect I had to show it off. Itâs like a poster Fox might show while reporting.
 Thought I just posted this but itâs possible there was a glitch. Just put your post on wordle.net and came up with this beautiful image. It cracked me up. Just in case people didnât understand Fox will be glad to show them:  Also have you watched the Daily Show from 16 Jun 08? I think youâd like it.
http://www.thedailyshow.com/full-episodes/index.jhtml?episodeId=173519 Yo, race is a social construct, remember? What you be talking about? John Scalzion ,  Hit a nerve,  annoy, one and the same.
Demâs donât like it when the truth slaps them in the face.  Mac, Why are you still going on about blacks, and swimming, and race. The Demâs are always the ones to bring up race, or sex, but try to say it is the Republicans that do it. Look, Obama is just a pawn. No one ever heard of him before, he did nothing in the senate, and wasnât even good at that. Are you going to tell me he is the best the Demâs have of all the people in their party, come on. He is a puppet to dance to their song. Do you really think his CHANGE, is, or can be, any different than all the others before him. If he does not follow the Dem rule, he will vanish from the party, and they will turn on him quickly.  He canât be the best they could offer. What ever happened to the JFKâS, or the Reganâs. Wouldnât it be exciting to have someone such as JFK running against Regan? What do we have, Obama, and McCain, geez. Is there no one better? Everyone love JFK, blacksâ whites, rich, and poor. Obama? True story. Today at work, I work in a factory by the way, We are on break, 2 white guyâs, one myself, and a mexican, and a black. I start out bringing up Obama just to get some one stirred up. It works. Then the other white guy says,no one will vote for a nâer, Iâll edit myself. Then, gasp, fâk you, kkk, and so on, then he says we are getting rid of all of them anyway. I say, yeah, and the mexicanâs are next, more gasp,fâk you, and racist, then they say, what about your wife, sheâs chinese, nah, they can stay, we like their restaurants, and their laundryâs, fâk you, so on, and so on. The bell rings, we go back in laughing it up, and continue to work together, and bash each other through out the night. They didnât care, black, and mexican, and us whites didnât care what they said in return. Its the ones that cry about everything all the time that are the true racist. Thank you, Mac. Warrior, please keep posting. This is awesome stuff. And stay off the medication â the posts are just that much better. Thanks. Thank you, entertaining, isnât it. you guys canât help but love me. Iâm just a big cuddly Lib basher. The only medâs I take is anti reds. Warrior: âJohn Scalzion , Hit a nerve, annoy, one and the same.
Demâs donât like it when the truth slaps them in the face.â Iâm not a Democrat, for one thing (registered independent since I could vote because I think political parties are not a good idea). And whatâs annoyed me is not your political views but the fact that you donât aggregate your posts (and are still not doing so, which means either you didnât understand what I asked you to do, or youâre just a bit of a dick). So youâre wrong on both counts. Mac, Why are you still going on about blacks, and swimming, and race. Because I disagree with what you said about blacks, swimming, race, and about Corby Kennard.  I thought that was clear? John Scalzi,    â Iâm not a Democrat, for one thing registered independent â But who did you vote for? Iâd say it was a Democrat by how you take offense so easy, and by your replyâs. You argue like a Lib also, calling names,  I guess because I hit a nerve, or annoyed you so. Anyone that would vote for a Republican would support me, so you must be brand X. Or is it brand RED. I have voted both ways, but havenât found a Dem worth voting for, for along time, and after seeing the NEW breed, I probably will never vote Dem again, unless you can find another JFK. Just your big penis. See, Iâm polite. Warrior, I would suggest you head over to Baenâs Bar where you will find lots of people who hold the same opinion that you do over the stuff that you have railed about here. You can sign up for the Bar at http://bar.baen.com/ Warrior: âBut who did you vote for?â Last election, I voted for a mix of each. Lately Iâve trended more toward Democrats, but lots of people could say that, which is part of the problem the GOP has these days. As for nerve-hitting: Not really. You argue poorly, read off a conservative talk radio check list, insult people like youâre Newt Gingrichâs mentally-challenged younger brother and make more than the number of typos that can be chalked up to random error. You donât rate access to my nerves. You donât think or write well enough for that. My major concerns with you are that you donât offend my other guests and that you donât post multiple sequential comments. Now, I understand youâre very impressed with yourself, and thatâs fine; good for you. But you should know this is does not oblige me to feel the same. But Iâll tell you what, Warrior. Since you seem to feel that you rate some special access to my attention, Iâll offer you this challenge. Iâve just stuck you into my moderation queue. Your challenge is to write something I actually think is worth responding to, on the merits of its argument. If you do, Iâll let it out. If you donât, I wonât. As extra incentive, each time you attempt to post and I find your argument wanting, Iâll remove one of your previous posts. Iâll start on the ones Iâve found most egregiously stupid and spiral out from there. Since apparently you know how to get on my nerves, you should know how not to do it, too. So, go on, Warrior: Impress me. Patrick V: Why would you wish this dude on Baenâs Bar? I pointed Warrior to Baenâs Bar because as I said in my post he echoes what a lot of the regular high volume posters say over there. There are people over asking if Barack really is a US citizen. It has since been definitively answered that he is, but that doesnât stop them from fervently wishing that the âObaminationâ that is somehow proven that he is not. One poster even started a thread that since he thinks Obama is virtually certain to win the White House and that the âDemoncratsâ will have significant gains in both House and Senate, that they will a) raise taxes, b) nationalize healthcare, c) implement serious restrictions on gun ownership, etc. The poster then asks for odds on how long it would take for there to be enough of a groundswell that open rebellion would break out and a new civil war will take place. (Beyond the initial post I did not read the thread.) Maybe on Baenâs Bar he can find some people who will be impressed with him as you said. @319 Yo, race is a social construct, remember? What you be talking about? So is finance. And we have WHOLE NEWSPAPERS about it. University degrees even.  :-) Warrior, you claim youâre not racist, and yet you find it acceptable to make racist jokes? Racist jokes about your own wife?! Hate to break it to you, but you are racist. Hell, if my boyfriend was privy to  conversation like that and someone made a crack at my ethnicity (or sex, or gender, etc), and he didnât defend me? Heâd consider himself lucky if all he got was an earful from me about it. Jenna: âHate to break it to you, but you are racist.â And a bit of an ass. That said, Warriorâs in the penalty box at the moment, and wonât be coming out unless/until he writes something I find intellectually acceptable, so addressing questions to him right now is probably a bit of a loss. Warrior writes, in a post thatâs not getting out of moderation: âYou can argue, that I donât argue well, like the rest of your bloggers do, but none of you have agrued any better than I.â Well, thatâs not true, as I have argued better than you have, for one. You are free to disagree, but inasmuch as your arguments to this point have been filled with implication, assumption, bad facts and hackneyed rhetoric, youâll understand if I privilege my own estimation above yours. As an example of your poor arguing skills, Iâll pull another quote out of not-to-be-released-from-moderation post, in which you ask me, apropos to a possible President Obama: âCan you tell me do you want to be taxed more?â The implication being that if Obama becomes president, my taxes will go up. Well, in fact, under Obamaâs proposed tax plan, my taxes wouldnât go up, nor would the taxes of the vast majority of Americans. Indeed, under Obamaâs proposed plan, they would go down just a bit. Go me.  So asking me if I want to taxed more doesnât apply; I wonât be. Chances are very good, Warrior, given the general distribution of income here in the US, that you wouldnât be paying more either. Mind you, I donât think youâre actually interested in whether I personally will be paying more in taxes; I suspect youâve just plopped the statement out there to offer up the implication that taxes for the average person generally will go up under Obama, which in fact they wouldnât. So either youâre ignorant of Obamaâs actual tax plan, in which case youâre arguing poorly (arguing from ignorance is not good arguing), or you know the details of the Obama tax plan, and youâre choosing to dishonestly frame the question, in which case youâre arguing poorly, and youâre being offensive about it, since youâre making the assumption I donât know the details of the plan, i.e., that Iâm ignorant. Which I donât appreciate. Beyond that one example, the rest of your entry is likewise filled with the sort of bad logic and unsupported assertions that just compound my opinion that you simply donât know how to argue, and that itâs not worth my time to try to correct each example of your ignorance and/or dishonesty, and your further arguments donât rate to appear on this site. So there it is. However, you are welcome to try again. Allow me to make the following recommendations. 1. Try to focus on the subject at hand, the subject being the one that the original entry was on. 2. Try not to ramble for nearly a thousand words, as you did in the entry Iâm not letting out of moderation. If you must ramble on that long, please learn about the subtle joys of paragraphs. 3. Iâm generally not a fascist when it comes to correct spelling and grammar in comments, since most of them are written quickly. But come on, sir. If you have the time to write a thousand words, you have time to clean up your writing afterward. Your arguments are poor enough without, as an example, having to have the word âboardersâ stand in for âborders.â Now, I understand you believe that your being in moderation is an example of how I only want like-minded folks here, but if you visit other threads here, youâll find lots of folks who disagree with me politically have nice, long, complex and interesting discussions with people who disagree with them. Itâs not your politics that dropped you in the moderation queue; itâs your inability to argue well combined with your puffed-up misapprehension that my unwillingness to engage your bad arguments somehow meant you were winning. Try again. Try better. Warrior: Nope, your latest attempt was no better. Youâre a bit of a loss, Iâm afraid. Since weâve come to the point where all thatâs happening on this thread is a vaguely trollish character trying to get past moderation, Iâll go ahead and close the comments. Warrior, because Iâm closing this thread, youâre out of the moderation queue, but do try better on other threads. I donât want to have to moderate your ass all over my site. If I have to do it too much, Iâll just blacklist you and have done with it. Comments are closed.

Fox addresses baby mama drama: Producer used "poor judgment" Since Salon's Alex Koppelman caught Fox News characterizing Michelle Obama as "Obama's Baby Mama," there's been an uproar over use of such an offensive term.

ORIGINAL REPORT:
As if implicating her as one half of a "terrorist fist jab" wasn't enough, Fox News has gone on to label Michelle Obama "Obama's baby mama." Salon's Alex Koppelman writes:  An alert reader wrote in just a little while ago to let us know about something he'd spotted on Fox News Wednesday afternoon. During a segment discussing conservative attacks against Michelle Obama, the wife of presumptive Democratic nominee Barack Obama, the network described the former as "Obama's baby mama." I checked, and sure enough, as you can see below, our e-mailer was right. In fact, that description was displayed on screen several times during the segment, which featured anchor Megyn Kelly and conservative blogger Michelle Malkin, an FNC contributor.  Koppelman has the video here, and you can see the stills below.   To be fair, Michelle Obama referred to Barack as her "baby's daddy" on the night he won his Senate seat in 2004.

 Fox addresses baby mama drama: Producer used 'poor judgment' - : Fox addresses baby mama drama: Producer used 'poor judgment' Reader Comments (139) Archives Categories Contact   Navigate:  Share this Article Multimedia   Find stories by: June 12, 2008 Categories: Pages Pages News Tip Sheets Policy More Info  Since Salon's Alex Koppelman caught Fox News characterizing Michelle Obama as "Obama's Baby Mama," there's been an uproar over use of such an offensive term. 

âA producer on the program exercised poor judgment in using this chyron during the segment,â Fox's Senior Vice President of Programming Bill ShineÂ saidÂ in a statement to Politico. 

In addition to being insulting, the phrase "baby mama" is also inaccurate. The Urban Dictionary defines "baby mama" as"the mother of your child(ren), whom you did not marry and with whom you are not currently involved."

Although Shine doesn't name anyone responsible, the show's producer is Jessica Herzberg. A Fox staffer said that others internally were bothered by describing the potential first lady and very accomplished womenÂ â as the senator's "baby mama."

Unfortunately for the network, this comes just days after Fox's E.D. Hill addressed her use of the phrase "terrorist fist jab" on-air in reference to the famous Michelle-Barack fist bump (or pound) made just before his celebratory speech in St. Paul. (Screenshot from Koppelman's piece) Does anyone seriously consider FOX a legitimate news station?  Come on they are nothing more than
sleezy tabloid entertainment.  The WWF is more credible. Never mind that Michelle Obama called Barack her "baby daddy". McCain's campaign should have to file a supplemental report with the FEC and acknowledge it's been receiving political advertising from FOX.

And FOX "News" should be forced to label these broadcasts as the advertisements that they are. Come on...first the "terrorist fist jab" and now this? FOX News, this is truly getting ridiculous.  The Obama's are a hardworking, AMERICAN couple who have worked towards the AMERICAN dream, just as all of us try to do.  Stop this shameful ingnorant Obama bashing. Let me clearly understand this...Fox News want us to believe that they are "fair and balanced." Well did they call Cindy the McCain's baby mama. Clearly his first wife could be called that. Unfortunately, no mention (negative) have been highlighted on their broadcast...curious how they repeat things about Obama that is unfair and clearly unbalanced. Personally, I would like to watch a Fox broadcasst that leans towards accurate and honest. Is that a slogan they can get their heads around? Is that asking too much...Accurate and honest...? I expected dirty politics as usual not this level of stupidity. FOX network should be embarrassed. Because I am embarrassed for them. Uh, no. Michelle Obama described her husband as "her baby's daddy." There is a big difference - there is nothing perjorative in that. Regarding the posting above by Roger Stone, Michelle Obama introduced her husband at a campaign event as my BABY'S daddy, not as you incorrectly stated. The 's makes a big difference that you conviently ommitted. What a blatant race baiting ploy. Fox News is really stupid if they think that this kind of racism will attract many people to John McCain. It'll only serve to push away viewers who don't want to be associated with such racist idiocy - including many McCain supporters. america is racist, these people have achieved so much and still have to listen this sht. shame, shame. Would anyone know fox existed if their stupidity wasn't reported? In the history of broadcast and cable journalism, has anyone ever heard a U.S. Senator's wife and possible First Lady referred to as a "Baby Mama"? Fox News preaches "family values" conservatism, even often gets on a high moral horse, and lectures the "black community" about taking "responsibility." Well, black America gives them Barack and Michelle Obama - married, apparently faithful, two beautiful children. What does Fox News give in return: a sexist, racist slur calling Michelle Barack's "Baby Mama." These people have no shame. Fox and its right-wing radio contingent have been doing this I-dare-you-to-accuse-us-of-being-racist dance ever since Obama annouced as a candidate. It obviously plays well with a large segment of their demographic or they wouldn't dare. O'Reilly & Hannity virtually froth at the mouth over Obama - leading with false and inaccurate stories about Obama for months and months - this is nothing new - it's very disappointing but we expect it from Fox!
Oh and this is clearly SEXIST & RACIST for all you Clinton "fans"! I'll live with the comment as long as they refer to Cindy McCain as "Sugar Mama" Discipline?  Anyone see anything Faux Noise's comments about ANY repurcussions for this b.s.?  Of course not.  Mistakes happen.  Repeated mistakes (of the same kind) + no accountability = intentional. Michelle Obama introduced her husband as "my babies' daddy". 

They have two beautiful daughters and she was referring to both of them. Faux News, like the GOP, is a stinking, rotting corpse. Okay, time for a mouth breather to exclaim, "but Faux has the highest ratings in the entire world" in 5...4...3...2....1 Keep it up Fox Noise.  Really, do not stop.  Give your target audience of old white men, all the red meat they want, without any of the filler. I THINK SINCE M.O. INTRODUCED HIM AS BABY DADDY THEN WHY THE OUT CRY?
WHAT ABOUT THE " BRO'S before HO'S" SHIRTS THAT OBAMA SUPPORTERS WERE WEARING? SAYING HILLARY IS A WHORE! THAT'S ACCEPTABLE TO HIS FOLLOWERS. what if everyone boycotted all companies that advertise on fox? Fox news is a disgrace. They are the GOP racist mouthpiece. This channel needs to be fined for its outrage. I own air space, correct? A stiff fine might remind FOX that there are people who care about the truth...and are fair and balanced. She said he was her "babies' daddy." It's different. There's a disturbing pattern emerging here. I (through Google News) saw a report on Wisconsin and Obama from Fox Business News.  It's "headline" was critical of Obama for Wisconsin business.  When I looked at the article I saw it was a press release made and "paid for" by the GOP.  Fox put it out as a news story.  Since it said it was paid for by the GOP, I think Fox should disclose how much they were paid to put it out and explain to readers how they can consider it a "news" story instead of the blatant propaganda it really is! Fox is a tabloid station For those who are defending this nonsense by reminding us all that Michelle Obama has used the term before, I would like to point out one thing. Michelle Obama is NOT a nationally televised news outlet. You are neglecting key elements in this issue: context and intent. I may affectionately refer to my well-to-do friends jokingly as "corporate pimps." I would be outraged to see that term used by a news outlet to describe them while reporting on their chosen professions. "There's a disturbing pattern emerging here."  There is no emerging pattern.  "Fair and Balanced" Fox is blatantly playing the race card.  How very white of them.... Boycott Fox...and its sponsors!  I stopped watching months ago and am glad I did!  Haven't missed it at all!  FOX....worst news in the world!  As Keith would say! The sun rises in the east, sets in the west, and Fox programs are a crock. How long will be required to take "poor judgment" as the excuse to allow the racist demagogues at FOX to continue spouting off?

Where is the accountability?  Here's how this works: ED Hill was going to get bumped, so why not let her make the "terrorist fist jab" comment when they were going to take her off the air anyway?

How about the prior assassination comment?  How about O'Reilly's "lynching party" comment toward Michelle?

This is beyond repeated poor judgment, it is a pattern of intentional race baiting scripted and condoned at the very highest levels of the network.

Free Speech?  What's next? Obviously that was inappropriate and unprofessional. BUT, what's with the double standard? It's acceptable for Obama to make sexist and racist remarks and for Michelle to make un-american comments? Oh, I get it, Obama's different, he's for change. He's not accountable for anything. Has anyone compiled a list of Fox advertisers?  That would come in really handy just about now.... You guys need to lightent up. I'm sure Fox will call Cindy John McCain's "Sugar Mama," given how fair and balanced they are. Ol' Lefty, this Fox Busines News story you saw was a word-for-word repetition of a GOP press release?  Did they disclose that at any point?  Can you post the link for the story? Despicable comes to mind.  It is part  of an emerging pattern from FOX of the basest racist slurs against the Obamas.  This is intolerable from a organization that thinks of itself of  as a news group.  They should make apologies and corrections hourly for a month, and fire anyone who was connected with this filth. Please don't ask Fox to stop.  I love Keith Olbermann's Countdown and watch it faithfully.  So what Fox does is just make it easier for Keith to do his show.  A good GOP friend keeps recommending Faux Noise to me, but all I need to do is watch Countdown, Jon Stewart's The Daily Show, Steve Colbert's The Colbert Report, and I'll get to see all of the really idiotic things that Faux seems to come up with every day.  

Aging Reader The producer needs to be fired right now.  No more questions asked. Just because Obama's BLACK, he gets a free ride. AMERICA is supposed to elect a man as president of the U.S., who refers to Wright (a crazy racist nutcase),
as his uncle, and his white grandmother as a typical white woman. What would you jerks do on this website, if a republican called Obama, a typical black man??
You would scream RACIST RIGHT_WING JERK!!  America will go into the booths on November 4th., and vote for John McCain.  Why?  Because, they are scared ****less of the unknown stranger, who has lots of shadey friends, and took weeks to get rid of his psycho racist pastor, who he hid in the basement
to pray.  Why is it that everyone is fair game to CRITISIZE, except Mr. Barack Obama?????????????????
WHY???????????????????????????????
MSNBC, and CNN have always been in the tank for Obama.  Mathews and Olberman are Radical Liberals. No one cares.  They have the lowest ratings on cable news.

Who really cares what Mrs. Obama has to say?  If FOX news is so wicked, then why is it the highest rated cable news station, year after year??

Because everyone watches it. But why? Are you calling the majority of the American people STUPID???


I am a Hillary supporter, who is defecting to the republicans. There are 17 million of us, plus the independents, and republicans who WILL vote for McCain.

Wake up, we don't trust Barack, and we don't like him.  That is our perogative.  The PEOPLE will decide, and you represent very little, and don't even know it. If someone at Fox is not fired over this, the apology means nothing. Really....does anybody watch FOX Noise anymore? They are just the worst cable news show ever! That is why Keith Olberman is knocking O'Reilley off out of the park in the ratings!! Just horrible journalists (if you can call them that)....Hannity, O'Reilley, The Beltway Boys, Carl Rove is on there every night. What a flippin nightmare channel. Just laughable! I cannot believe this was a mistake! This is why we continue to have some people acting in this manner because of antics like such.
Fox news should be more than ashame for putting that nonsense out there. It shows no matter how professional you are people want to think of you in a bad light based on their ignorance. Once again Fox news makes the list for stupidity! Great job....not! That's becuase Fox is a bunch of jerks.  They use their t.v. channel to spew right wing, racist, anti-gay, crap all the time.  A bunch of air head blondes, white old men, you've got fox.  I don't even add the word news next to Fox.  It's not news. Does anyone seriously consider FOX a legitimate news station? Come on they are nothing more than sleezy tabloid entertainment. The WWF is more credible. 

Posted By: Nadine | June 12, 2008 at 01:29 PM ********************************* Who are you trying to kid? FOX is the number one cable news outlet. Hi. I'm Michelle. Barack is my husband. These are my daughters, and he's my daughters'(babies) daddy. (THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS SAYING.) O'Reilly has never "foamed at the mouth" over Obama.  He has been more than fair to him. "Never mind that Michelle Obama called Barack her "baby daddy"."

Yes indeed, nevermind it, because what she said was that he was her "baby's daddy" which, while still something of a slang, is neither grammatically incorrect nor implying that her children are illegitimate.

But please, do continue living in Michelle Malkin's echo chamber.  I'm sure it's far more comfortable in there for you than out here, where this sort of thing is despicable. Agenda driven news will always be vunerable to this sort of thing. It's just too tempting to try and be cute. Mrs Obama, or Michele Obama, or the Senators wife were all ways to describe her that would be good enough. Oh, but no, they need to give their viewers some red meat. They end up looking like meatheads. There really won't be too much fallout from this.  Fake Noise gets to say, oops, our bad, huh huh, nothing to see here, and that's that.

Now, if CNN called John Mccain an impotent old *******, the avalanche of right wing outrage would be too large to catalog.  

But since it's Fake Noise that did it, we expect them to sink to the lowest levels imaginable on a daily basis.

First it was a 'terrorist fist jab' now this.  It just goes to show how scared the right wing noise machine is of Obama; they have to result to name calling as they cannot take him down on his record or his character.  How long before they call him a ************ or ni$$er because you know that's coming too. Do you think we'd ever see this:

OUTRAGED CONSERVATIVES: STOP PICKING ON MCCAIN'S DRUG HO! Thank you Politico for calling Fox News on their slanderous coverage of Michelle Obama. The program producer should be suspended immediately and Megyn Kelly needs to make a public apology to the Obama family. This was completely unacceptable, both sexist and racist. And to think that some people, my Republican mother included, continue to insist that Fox is a dispassionate source of hard news. There is a big difference between Michelle using the term "baby daddy" in jest, and a major new network using it to quantitfy someone. FAUX News or FOX Noise, as I like to call them, are really having a hard time with the idea that someone other than a  older white male, could possibly be president. In their attempt to try to diminish the character of the Obama's they are losing their viability as a credible new source. It is bad enough that they have two hacks in Sean Hannity and  Bill O'Reily disguised as journalists. In essence they are Rupert Murdoch's attack dogs, and this "baby mama" FAUX pas, is yet another attempt to make Obama seem to urban to middle "white America". A both rmp and hajo correctly stated:

Michelle Obama said "here's my BABY'S daddy Clearly this is another case of the scrutiny that Obama and unfortunately his wife have to deal with. I'm curious to see what McCain and his supporters have geared up for. I feel that the prejudice and discrimination that Obama would be percieved to be attacked with hasn't surfaced. While this is a pessimistic view, i feel that attacks on Obama's race or religion haven't reached what i would be assumed they be. I am an Obama supporter and to be quite honest, I'm looking for a little bit of this racism to head Obama's way. I think him running for president with a more than 50% chance of winning will be even more slighted his way with McCain or any of his supporters to slip and say something directly to Obama. Soon americans on the average will realize what the system and what people across the nation deal with. I'll finish from earlier, In short what i'm saying is that if Obama's opponents slip up, i think the people of america will shy away from that sort of stupidity and irrogance and cast their vote for obama, not as a sympathy vote but simply because they are tired of the country going that way.

Also, Fox News is a terrible media outlet, i completely agree with the WWF comment and i'll add that the Daily Show and the Colbert Report, which are comedy news shows are more accurate than Fox News.

Obama. This is exactly the type of stuff that will be coming from the Right this whole election, no matter how hard they try to keep it bottled up.

There's no way that certain people on the right will be able to hide the fact that they're focused on Obama's race and want to talk about it.

Watching closet bigots struggle to stay in the closet the next five months (and four, eight years) will be hilarious.

Can we just start calling this type of gaffe a "Ferraro"? OOPS!

Punctuation correction to my previous post.

I wrote that Michelle Obama introduced her husband as "my BABY'S daddy".

It should have read:  "my BABIES' daddy" --

-- in the plural form of the word "baby" since the Obamas have *2* kids. to FOX - "Stop this shameful ingnorant Obama bashing."

But they are democrats so FOX thinks it is okay.  

The fact that the Obama's combined IQ's probably exceed the total on the FOX executive floor is irrelevant It seems to me that Fox's MO for this campaign is to make these kind of comments and then apologize for it.  Meanwhile, the damage is done because no one remembers the apology. This was bad, no doubt, but can I bring up, say, MSNBC? Fox is watched more than all other cable news networks combinded! They do make mistakes, but they generally cover both sides of the argument, which is more than any of the other so-called newtworks can say. Will someone please tell White people we don't call White people, 'whitey'.  That's what caricatured 60's Black Panthers called White people.  NO Black person under 60 would use the term Whitey or Cracker or Ofay. It is a term that some White people ( over 50) think we use in private.  The very fact that it is used shows just how false it is. Oh goodness, you people are so hurt! Bleed, bleed... And yes, "babies' daddy" is SO completely different. The two are totally unrelated. Get a grip. Fox will have all its broadcast licenses challenged after 2008's elections are over. A wonderful thing indeed. I find it hilarious that nobody talks about McCain's Sugar Mama. Nadine, does anyone consider Fox a legitimate news stattion?  Why yes I do. Do you liberals consider MSNBC/NBC legitimate?  When Matthews starts reporting new without referencing the thrills up his leg and Olby stops calling our soldiers and the President "murders" at the same time they are anchoring election coverage then you can talk.  You Foc news bashers are hypocrites or as Michelle Obama would say Goddam American hypocrite. Not that I like even coming to this junkyard, but this is more like an apology and an "explanation" here than any kind of perspective.

Trashy behavior excused on a trashy website. WAAAAAAAAAAAAA, WAAAAAAAAAAAA Fox honchos are: 

Troubled by: a bunch of dumba**es who tried to cop the hip lingo and failed miserably.

Not troubled by: Commentary by discredited bigot and stalker of chronically ill eleven-year-olds, Michelle Malkin. Is FOX the only channel you zombies receive? If not, haven't you figured out how to change the channel. What a group of loosers on this thread, get a life! Michelle Obama called Barack Obama her "Baby's Daddy".  Just a TINY bit different, but what to ethics and standards and integrity matter to FOX and Republicans.  Hey,  we're getting our ass kicked...time to start scraping the bottom of the barrel as usual.  Wonder why only 25% of the country will even admit to being Republicans....If you want something new, a President that will not lie to you and lie to go to war, go visit www.barackobama.com and read his views, read the blogs and see what people who know him think.  He is a very good human being, and it is time we had one in the White House.    It has been WAY too long. TRUE BLUE:  Referred to on this blog as Cindy McCain being John McCain's "DRUG HO".

Where is the outrage.  Not one comment, but mine, condemning this
discusting sexist slur against McCain's wife.  I hope she sues the
pants off of you, TRUE BLUE, for 
defemation of character, and slander, etc.

If the tables were turned, and anyone called Michelle Obama a "HO", we would have WW111, race riots, and America would be burned to the ground in defense of her.

This is ourageous.  Say something against this kind of hateful remarks!!!  

What are you all hypocrytical COWARDS on this blog, with yellow streaks running down your back???

Say something against this, my fellow Americans!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fox Senior Vice President, BILL SHINE said in a statement to Politico...

"Bill Shine"?  You have got to be kidding me. FOX is a disgrace. I am an African American female college professor from a well-off suburban background who nevertheless has white students who assume I'm from the "hood." Being from an inner-city or impoverished environment is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of; however, racists will constantly "ghettoize" successful African Americans regardless of what we achieve in order to diminish our accomplishments. This kind of commentary merely exacerbates that tendency. So what's gonna happen to that ho Jessica Herzberg (who no doubt wouldn't take offense at the adjective, cool and hip as she be)? I was outraged about this until I read the CNN transcript of election night 2004, when Michelle Obama introduced her husband, the senator-elect of Illinois as "Barack Obama, my babies' daddy."

I figure if it's cool for Michelle then it's cool for Fox. Look, Michelle Obama could have introduced her husband, the new senator, as "the father of my children." But she consciously chose a variant of the more lower socioeconomic, AA, "my baby daddy" construction. Fine. Then let's not take Fox to task for doing the same thing.

And if people look at that transcript of CNN's election night coverage in 2004, they'll see that after talking about how "fired up" he was, among the first people he thanked was his pastor, Jeremiah Wright. CAN WE MOVE 'FOGS NOOZE' OFF-SHORE...? Fox news, what a sewer. I'm waiting for Geraldine Ferraro to denounce this misogynist slur against a hard-working and accomplished female. Uh, Geraldine...?? First Liz Trotta, a contributor of Fox News, makes an assassination joke about Sen. Obama and now we have to put up with Fox News assassinating Michelle Obama's character! They are a disgusting example of a news station. It doesn't matter what Michelle Obama calls her husband, FOX shouldn't be using those terms. Senator McCain has called his wife something I won't even dare print here...would that make it OK for FOX to use? gree with Oliver Willis.  Faux should just call it as they would prefer and call her the N word and call it a day. How many of you people complained when Hillary was called a "whore", or "f*in whore" "lesbian" "dyke" etc?
not too many I bet. I am sooo sick of reading all of these racist comments and ignorant half wits who continue to defend Hillary Clinton.  In case you haven't gotten the press release, Barack Obama is the presumptive nominee and his wife does deserve respect!  To say that Obama has gotten a free ride??? You CANNOT be serious!  Only a trained monkey with the I.Q. of a plastic doorknob would make such an idiotic assertion.  I'm so sick of the racism.  You think that we as a supposedly progressive country, would be beyond such ignorance and stupidity. FOX News is a DISGRACE!!!  For the record, I would NEVER, EVER vote for John McCain . . . not even if my brain was extracted forcefully!!!!!!! Nadine:
Better than CNN, MSNBC and all 3 networks combined.  They are all shills for Obama.
I dont see you cry'n about the continual stream of mouth diarrhea
from "newsman" keith olbermann. Wait, stop?how can this be racist?  I watched when Obama won his Senate seat and was amazed when his wife introduced him as your new Senator from Illinois, ?My baby Daddy, Barack Obama!?

Is this another instance where some can say it but others can?t?  Was she just reassuring us in case us racists white folk had any doubt? 

Check the meaning of Baby Daddy on the Urban Dictionary!

There is video of this if anyone wants to find it -- probably at Fox!
David Nadine, you probably watch "legitimate" news stations like MSNBC and CNN...  Well, at least they have 1 viewer. This is part of a despicable pattern from GOP TV.

They're only fooling the stupid. May we ask Obama on Father's Day  "Who's your Daddy?" Fred Stone, read Critical Thinker below.

As CT said one might in jest refer to a beloved spouse out of name or with some slang term.  But a supposed news organization treating a high achieving, decent hard-working, person like Michelle, our future First Lady, God willing, in this disrespectful manner is asinine and highly insulting.  And if you had sense, you'd recognize the difference. Poor judgment ?you think? more like the same old racist stereotyping. Someone need to be fired!
I am fed up with this type of broadcasting.  ?Terrorist fist jab? now ?Baby mama? what?s next? Nevertheless  these remarks speaks volume of Fox?s News. My baby Daddy, = my baby's Daddy.  (we just got through another one of these idiotic misquote kerfuffles).

Faux News is both stupid and vicious; two sides of the same political coin. Funny how none of the other networks seem to make these kind of gaffs weekly - and Fox only seems to make them when talking about Obama. Wishing him assassinated, "confusing" his name with Osama (repeatedly), The terrorist fist jab, and now this? Fair and Balanced? Please. Faux News is controlled by the Republican Party. The network is an embarrassment.

What other outlet would employ Karl Rove, a man who should be in prison for crimes against the United States, as a political commentator? Ok... seriously.  Let me be the first to say that I believe the position of president deserves respect for the person holding that position and their family.  
Obama has not reached that position yet, but I do believe that some respect is owed to him and his family.  Fox news crossed a line here, but I DO think they were attempting to bring back attention to the comment that Michelle made about her "babies' daddy".  

Someone said to look at the transcript and prove that she said baby's and not baby.  First, the transcript does in fact say "baby's".  Are we to assume, then, using the transcript as the end all be all that Michelle intended to imply that her husband was only the father to ONE of her children since she used a singular form?  Of course not.  So, let's not rely 100% on a transcript.  Michelle WAS referring to this low-class slang term when she said it.  She usually carries herself much higher than that.

She could very easily have chosen different words if her goal were simply to reference her children.  Please don't insult us with trying THAT argument.

It was disgusting for Fox to use the term and it was disgusting for the potential first lady to use that term.  Both should be ashamed. "The WWF is more credible."
Awesome! If "Fred Stone" cant see the racism dripping from the inaccurate use of a race-freighted term to demean Michelle Obama, he is naive.  My guess is that anyone defending Fox on this or the 'terrorist fist bump' are in the tank for right wing lunacy.  Sad Why aren't women furious over this comment? Isn't this sexist? I think that this is pretty low class and race-baiting by Fox News.

But I think that those that make a distinction between baby's daddy and baby daddy are being ridiculous.  It is exactly the same thing.  

I do think that there is a difference between Michelle Obama making that statement than Fox News putting doing it. One of the comments says that she has read the transcript of CNN and it says that Michelle Obama said my baby's daddy not my babies daddy. That is used as proof that she was using slang.  Tell me, how could CNN know whether Michelle was saying baby's or babies' daddy.  Can they read her mind since the two words sound exactly the same?  Maybe the CNN transcript is a mistake.  Either way there is no excuse for a newstation to call any woman baby momma, much less one who is educated, successful, and accomplished.  Fox calls themselves a news station and for those of you who want to defend them, there is nothing to defend.  This is just blatant racist and sexist propoganda.  I don't agree with this type of journalism no matter who the target is.  For those of you who think you are watching news, you really need to realize that you are watching something that more closely resembles the National Enquirer. Just because Barry "Punished her with a Baby!" Oh drat. Not only is Fox the number one CHOICE in cable news, but now they're reporting that America might just be WINNING THE TERROR WAR IN IRAQ. It's enough to make you wish for the old days when you had Nancy Reagan arround to make fun of.

Barack Obama's half brother Malik said Thursday that if elected his brother will be a good president for the Jewish people, despite his Muslim background. 

In an interview with Army Radio he expressed a special salutation from the Obamas of Kenya. 

Is this another dastardly Fox trick? I wouldn't mind "baby mama" as much if they also referred to McCain's wife as "trophy babe" Fox News:
Long a  tool of the Republican message
is once again trying to "Swift Boat"
the Democratic candidate with offensive 
and untruthful slogans. Words matter!
Lets have some truth come out of the media!
And SPIN, SOUND BITES THAT ARE LIES Why is Michell Makin still on the air.  This "racist" needs to be yanked from broadcasting, immediately. "Tell me, how could CNN know whether Michelle was saying baby's or babies' daddy. Can they read her mind since the two words sound exactly the same? Maybe the CNN transcript is a mistake. "

I guess I still don't get the distinction between baby daddy, baby's daddy, and babies' daddy.  To me they are all derived from the same slang.

I guess in my mind when a lot of people say they are not racist, this is true in a lot of ways, but I think they are still uncomfortable with black culture.  I think that's why only someone like Barack, who doesn't "act black" or "talk black" is in the position to run for president.

And I think this type of stuff does hurt him, whether it's Michelle Obama saying "baby's daddy", or him brushing the dirt off his shoulders etc. When this type of crap comes out of a preacher it's ok.  It's even ok to listen to him preach for 20 years.  But a news organization should be above reproach.  You want a Obama love fest then go to MSNBC. Ahhh, isn't the Liberal mentality refreshing.

Posted By: Dr. Marti Hunsucker yes, people do take Fox seriously. They are called Republicans and a lot of them live in Texas. Evan:

I can't speak to the majority of Americans being stupid, but if you really were a Hillary supporter, and you really are planning to vote for McCain, then that would certainly put you in that category. I supported Hillary, and I'm still seething at how she was treated (although admittedly she could have run a better campaign), but I'm sure not going to vote for 4 more years of Bush lite. Latte-drinking liberals claim that Obama and his wife were married for six years before they had their first child.  They also claim that Michelle Obama is a "Princeton educated lawyer".  Conservatives insinuate that Michelle Obama is a crack ho that had illegitimate children with Barack.

Both sides of the debate are on equal footing.  Conservatives are entitled to their opinions because they are conservatives, not because they are supported by so-called "facts".  It's fine to make up news items as long as they conform to racist Republican stereotypes.

Why don't liberals like fair and balanced news coverage? This is the network that our illustrious vice president demands to have preset on his hotel room TV when he is traveling.  Nuff said. To rip off a great line from Dennis Miller, the color of the Obama's skin isn't an issue but the thinness of their skin is a worry. Some people go out of their way to be "outraged" because it is to their advantage to do so. I expected more than a tired, cynical ploy from the liberal messiah who is supposed to be all about change and hope. This is really sad.  A network that claims to be a "news" network has to resort to inaccurate name calling to try to scare the American public about an upstanding citizen and his family.  If the person at Fox who called Michelle Obama's baby mama did it out of ignorance, she should be fired.  Obviously she is not qualified for her job.  This is unacceptable and should result in severe punishment of the person responsible for the false label. 'poor judgment' is not an apology, it's a commendation. I understand 'poor judgment' is a required qualification found in every job announcement for fox nuwz.  Just say'n. It's out there you know. Now maybe some of Obama's supporters see how Hillary supporters feel when CNN,NBC AND MSNBC bashed Hillary and bill thru the primaries,now Obama's camp wants them to help him by campaining,I hope they let him ;lose on his own,poor canditate,the best one is out,now no substance to listen too.MCCain is sounding better every day.Fox is best and everyone know's that. Fox News MUST be full of IDIOTS! Fire the ******* and apologize to Barack and Michelle Obama. Is it not rascit for Obama to refer to a rumor that he is Muslim as a "smear." 

What does that say about Obama's thoughts on another religion? 

The race card works both ways. You have probably never listened once to a broadcast.  You think the networks are not shills for BO. Ha Ha I think people are overreacting. Yeah, this is more like something that Jerry Springer would say, but, within the black community, you hear people jokingly refer to their spouse as their baby daddy or baby mama all the time. And, didn't Michelle introduce Barack, who could be the future president of the United States, as her baby daddy.  Plus, they're the ones doing pumping fists, and brushing dirt off their shoulders, and other things to try to seem cool and hip. If it were BET referring to Michelle as Barack's baby mama, no one would have had a problem with it. Fox is a racist tv station and has racists reporting the news....They are unprofessional, and it really makes the journalisim proffession look unproffesional....The FCC needs to yank them off the air....and how come Cindy McInsane can't be a baby's momma?.....Oh yeah, thats right.....She is Trailor Trash!!!! Um... Typical liberal comments about a news agency that call's 'BOTH' sides on their crap.

Last I checked, Michelle called her husband "My baby Daddy". Wow those racist idiots strike again...How Long?...Not Long! @Dave in NC

(And by the way, in response to a couple of comments above, Michelle called Barack her "babys' daddy" NOT "baby daddy", and in any case is very different from calling a woman a "baby mama".  Just ask around!) I'm not sure how old and/or outside of pop culture some folks seem to be here, but let's run through it one more time.  My babies' daddy does NOT = Baby Daddy.  My husband also happens to be my babies' daddy.  Another woman's boyfriend might be her babies' daddy.  But a woman's Baby Daddy (while being her babies' daddy,) is a man whose only relationship with her is that of father of her children.  So "Baby Mama" is a term used to describe the relationship of a person who is not your wife, generally not even your ex-wife, not your girlfriend, simply the mother of your children.  You babies' mama on the other hand may well be your wife or girlfriend - or Baby Mama.  While the wording may be similar, the kind of relationship described by Baby Mama or Daddy is a meaningful nuance. exasperated, So, when you introduce your husband, you often refer to him as your babies' daddy?  I know that every time I introduce mine, I certainly don't.  I introduce him as my husband.  When Michelle Obama... the woman hoping to be our country's First Lady, introduced her husband, the speech was dignified and high-class until she made ONE comment:  "My babies' daddy!" 

Now WHY would she choose those words?  Because she was INTENTIONALLY drawing on the same slang nature in use with the term "baby daddy".  It was done purposefully.

Yes, Fox was wrong... but SO was she.  She made herself look bad. ENM - I agree.  I think she was drawing on the slang, and it was a poor word choice that I feel ghettoized her a bit.  Heck, the couple being accused of not being "black" enough, maybe that's what she was going for, who knows.  But the point that there is an important difference in meaning there still stands in any circumstances. My we must be so careful of what we say about the Obama's, yet we can let it rip with the Bush's and the Cheney's.  WHY IS THAT? fox news is a joke!
The comments are ridiculous and show how they are not a credible source for any news. They are just a right wing propaganda machine. Every self respecting person, no matter what side they are on, BOYCOTT fox news and let the dice fall where they may. People like me help make FOX News the highest rated.  I could watch FOX 24 hours if not for other responsibilities.  I love their presenters, commentators and most of their guests. Not only are they trying to associate Obama with street slang and trigger racial stereotyping (or worse) in the minds of their white audience, they are attributing the language to "Outraged Liberals" which is a label designed to characterize anyone who supports Obama or anyone who happens to dislike attacks on his wife.

It's one thing to let bias creep into the delivery of a story, but it's quite another to construct so carefully a message intended to deceive.  There are no outraged liberals calling out, "Stop picking on Obama's baby mama."  This kind of willful distortion can be found only in tabloid journalism.  National Inquirer and Fox News.

The rest of the irony is that the Fox story in its entirety is about whether there will be a backlash if Republicans go after Michele Obama.  While I happen to agree that Michele?s comments are fair game, the program only interviewed one person on this ?issue.?  Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin not only makes the fair game claim, she goes on to characterize Republicans and conservatives as victims of a reverse distortion that attributes all bad publicity about Michele as having originated with them.  Malkin says that only ?gratuitous and cheap shots? having ?nothing to do with what she?s saying? would be out of bounds.  And yet there it is on a banner right below the interview ~ one big fat Cheap Shot.  Astounding really.

The other intriguing element in this story is that Fox presents this coverage as a story about media behavior and political strategy.  Meanwhile they are really just making use of opportunities within the story to repeat the quote from Michele that frankly is no longer news.  This is how to make news out of something from the past, how to keep dredging up the one thing you want everyone to remember.

http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/2008/06/11/fox_obama/index.html?source=refresh I wish to hell I had never heard of Barrack Obama! All this racist garbage on here makes me want to puke! Get over it! He is the sole reason and nothing good can come from this! That's all we are going to hear until he is gone from the stage.
I don't blame him. He's not the one doing this. In fact he's the opposite. But his presence brings out the worst in some people. People just love to hate and this racism crap does nothing but bring out hate and anger. I'm sick of it. I think you guys are crazy.

The "baby momma" comment was totally out of line and I hope Fox makes a more public apology about it. Yes, there may be racists in the organization; I have no idea.

But watch the actual news segments. There may be analysts who disagree with Obama's views, but the vast majority of the comments are hugely complimentary toward him. I disagree with a lot of his policies too, but man, you can't saw he isn't an amazing speaker or that he isn't accomplished. I get excited watching his speeches too, and I'm a libertarian! But I don't see any systematic racist element in the Fox presentations.

And to the commenter who mocked Fox and likes Keith Olbermann... are you kidding? Olbermann is *exactly* the same as the Fox analyts, just with a liberal perspective.  Facebook logo  boyfriend is going to visit baby mama soon  Advertisements  Advertisements

   Jon Scalzi: Back in the day â you know, when presidential candidates were respectably white â news organizations called potential First Ladies âwives.â But now that black folks are running, we can get all funky fresh with the lingo, yo. So itâs basically fine for Fox News to use âBaby Mamaâ for Michelle Obama, slang that implies a married 44-year-old Princeton-educated lawyer is, to use an Urban Dictionary definition of the term, âsome chick you knocked up on accident during a fling who you canât stand but you have to tolerate cuz she got your baby now.â Because the Obamas are black! And the blacks, theyâre all relaxed about that shit, yo. Word up. And anyway, as the caption clearly indicates, itâs not Fox News thatâs calling Michelle Obama âBaby Mama,â itâs outraged liberals. Fox News is just telling you what those outraged liberals are saying. They didnât want to use the term âBaby Mama.â But clearly they had no choice. Meanwhile, over at her personal site, Michelle âFox Newsâ Ethnic Shieldâ Malkin defends Fox Newsâ use of the âBaby Mamaâ phrase by essentially making two arguments. First, Michelle Obama once called Barack Obama her âbabyâs daddy,â and as we all know, a married woman factually and correctly calling her husband her childâs father is exactly the same as a major news organization calling a potential First Lady some chick what got knocked up on a fling. Second, the term âbaby-daddyâ has gone out into the common culture; heck, even Tom Cruise was called Katie Holmesâ baby-daddy, you know, when he impregnated her and she subsequently gave birth while the two were not married, which is exactly like what happened between Michelle and Barack Obama, who were married in 1992 and whose first child was born six years later. So by Malkinâs reasoning itâs perfectly fine for Fox News to call Michelle Obama the unmarried mother of Barack Obamaâs children because an entirely different phrase has to her mind entered the common culture, and there was this one time that Michelle Obama once uttered something that sounded like that entirely different phrase, which is not the phrase that Fox News used. But wait! Malkin also points to someone in her comment thread saying that one time, Michelle Obama actually used the phrase âbaby daddyâ! No apostrophe! Itâs in a comment thread, so it must be true. Therefore, Michelle Obama apocryphally using a piece of urban slang makes it perfectly okay for Fox News to use an entirely different piece of urban slang. And thatâs why, you see, it wonât be a problem for Bill OâReilly to refer to Barack Obama as âmy niggaâ on the next OâReilly Factor.
 I doubt this ridiculousness could've been mocked any better.   Free Daily Email

  Sign #1 your relationship might not be guaranteed eternal wedded bliss: Youâre a professional athlete and sheâs a cheerleader. Sign #2: She files a paternity suit, and you demand a DNA test before youâll pay any child support. And sign #3: Youâre accused of pulling out her hair, and slamming her head against a marble floor.  Thatâs the charge brought against Larry Fitzgerald by the mother of his child, former Raiderette Angela Nazario. Nazario claims she brought their 11-month-old son to Fitzgeraldâs Phoenix home for a visit, they started arguing. Letâs see how the plaintiff describes how a multimillionaire athlete calmly and maturely handles a disagreement, after the jump.  Via TMZ, Nazario admits she swung at him first in a play fight, and âmay have hit his face.â Fitzgerald then turned from playful to enraged, allegedly pushing Nazario down to her knees. She claims he âgrabbed me by my hair with both hands on the back of my head very very hard and tossed me across the room.â Later, when she tried to leave with her son, Nazario says Fitzgerald âgrabbed the back of my neck and slammed me down on the marble floor â¦ [I] was disoriented for awhile and could not get up, I remember he mumbled something about âthatâs what happens when you try taking my son away from me.ââ As she got in the car to leave she realized she had lost âchunksâ of hair. This sounds pretty serious, but Fitzgerald did allegedly suggest she get an abortion. Maybe heâs unclear on how human pregnancies work, and is trying to take care of it himself. Whatever. Itâs not like itâs this distraction thatâll cause the Cardinals to lose Saturday. For the curious, some photos of Nazario from her cheerleading days:

                 6 13 0 ok so.. We baby mama moved out of baby daddy's house she took all the pictures and didn't leave him with anything. We have pictures of my SD up around the house but it's pics that we took. Mind you I have been in my daughter's life since she was 2. So I only have pictures that we took from then until now. Well my daughter had a time line project to do and it was about her life. My SD started to ask questions on howcome we don't have any baby pictures of her. Well I had asked baby mama a couple of years ago for some pictures. At first she was said sure and that she would give me some. Well time has passed and she still hasn't. When I ask for them again she said that I said I don't need them anymore. It's annoying because my SD knows how her mother is and asks all kinds of questions. Seeing her face when we explain things to her hurts because no child should go through that. UGHH... If she only knew how much she is hurting her child.

                 205 9 8 Honey, first of all the only reason shes insulting you is becasue of jelousy. Actually it sounds like everything she has done is becasue of jelousy. Just tell your SD hat it is not very nice the way her mommy talks about you, please keep things that are not nice to herself. Its sad but when your SD grows up she will know the truth. good luck!

                 6 13 0 well that kicking and not listening could just be a taste of her biomom's own medicine.  Hate to say it but what comes around goes around.. Just let the biomom talk her mess. I know I should listen to what I preach but sometimes it is hard cause we are caught in the situation.  The thing you guys can say is well she knows how to calm herself down here at our house and then apologizes for what she did. hehe.. Wait that may be wrong too.. lol.. Cause it's like you will throwing in her face how disciplined she is at your house. hehe

                 12 65 0 oh no do you think the mom is just saying that to him now bc she wants my bf to get upset with me.....(even though the biomom has called him way before he confronted her about the mommy said quotes. ) i mean she had called before bc she was acting up, but she never used the line "ever since she has been back from your place..." until after she was confronted.....do you think she was trying to imply that I was making the child kick, like i said hey sd, go home and kick mommy and dont listen to her......lol...i know that probably seems odd to some but you should see proir emails from her, they would explain everything... Â  I agree with the stuff you said my sd tries to get away with the things both me and my bf have witnessed at her moms house at our house it takes a couple hrs for her to realize that we have rules here....and then she is good but up until a few weeks ago, when her mom said that she dont have to listen to me oh no do you think the mom is just saying that to him now bc she wants my bf to get upset with me.....(even though the biomom has called him way before he confronted her about the mommy said quotes. ) i mean she had called before bc she was acting up, but she never used the line "ever since she has been back from your place..." until after she was confronted.....do you think she was trying to imply that I was making the child kick, like i said hey sd, go home and kick mommy and dont listen to her......lol...i know that probably seems odd to some but you should see proir emails from her, they would explain everything...

                 6 13 0 Krystal, It's hard to read what the stepkids are thinking.  Your sd may be trying to see what she can get away with from both sides. Or it could be she is just wanting to get attention.. It's hard. My sd would come back to us with an attitude from hell, because that is how her bio-mom is. But she would be quick to realize that at our house we don't act like that. She also tries to play both sides to see what she can get. However the other side, the biomom, alls into the trap. For example, my sd came up to be almost 3 years ago and asked to call me mommy. I told her that is fine with me. So she has been calling me mommy. However, her biomom states that we are the ones that forced her into calling me mom because that is what the child stated. SHe has a really big problem with that. I think she, the biomom is just upset that her step-dad ( her new hubby) is not as involved in her life as I am. Well, that was until they had a baby together. Now he is just rude to her, but I am still in the wrong for taking care of her. Anyway.. back to you, The child can just be going through some things and just testing you guys. Keep an eye on how she acts when she comes back and see.

                 30 32 2 the best advice I can give you after 14 years of dealing with my husband's ex wife is to ignore as much as possible b/c most times they're just trying to get a rise out of you so they can say... see I told you she was a trouble maker.Â  Most of our problems through the years have had to do with her wanting money & more $$ & more $$, but there was def a time that she tried (& actually still does from time to time I think) to make my stepson think that I was this great, evil force in the world... & for awhile he bought into it.Â  You can try to be friendly with her, but you will never (I repeat never) have a normal relationship with her.Â  The best you can do is do what is best for you & your husband & children (including your stepchild).Â  Treat her as you would your own, love her just the same no matter what & in the end, it will turn out ok.Â  Your relationship with your stepdaughter is what counts, not what the ex thinks.Â  As your stepdaughter gets older she will understand that her mommy was bitter & petty & the time will come when you can sit down & talk to her about everything, but at 4 years old you just have to let it roll off your back & love her just the same.Â  You also have to remember that no matter what her mommy says she will always be her mommy & your stepdaughter will always defend her to no end, no matter what.Â  Hope that helps.Â  I know it's frustrating trust me, you feel like you're always the one that has to bite her tongue & it's so unfair... & it is, but that's just how it is... you'll learn to adjust as will your stepdaughter. the best advice I can give you after 14 years of dealing with my husband's ex wife is to ignore as much as possible b/c most times they're just trying to get a rise out of you so they can say... see I told you she was a trouble maker.Â  Most of our problems through the years have had to do with her wanting money & more $$ & more $$, but there was def a time that she tried (& actually still does from time to time I think) to make my stepson think that I was this great, evil force in the world... & for awhile he bought into it.Â  You can try to be friendly with her, but you will never (I repeat never) have a normal relationship with her.Â  The best you can do is do what is best for you & your husband & children (including your stepchild).Â  Treat her as you would your own, love her just the same no matter what & in the end, it will turn out ok.Â  Your relationship with your stepdaughter is what counts, not what the ex thinks.Â  As your stepdaughter gets older she will understand that her mommy was bitter & petty & the time will come when you can sit down & talk to her about everything, but at 4 years old you just have to let it roll off your back & love her just the same.Â  You also have to remember that no matter what her mommy says she will always be her mommy & your stepdaughter will always defend her to no end, no matter what.Â  Hope that helps.Â  I know it's frustrating trust me, you feel like you're always the one that has to bite her tongue & it's so unfair... & it is, but that's just how it is... you'll learn to adjust as will your stepdaughter.

                 1 10 1 First off, my sympathies, because I know how you feel. My husband's ex was a whack when he and I first got together and all through our engagement. She would tell the boys not to listen to me or be nice to me...if they listened or were nice, than there would be repercussions when they got home and she did drill them when they got home. After we got married, she lightened up alot and we actually became friends. I never showed her that what she had to say bothered me and continually showed the boys love. When they would say my mommy said this or my mommy said that, I would simply state that I am sorry that their mommy feels that way about me, but I like her or thought she was nice or a good mommy or whateverÂ and showed no anger or emotion whatsoever that what she said had bothered me...ifÂ she knows she is getting to you, she will keep on digging in on you. Once the kids were gone, I talked about it to my husband, but he never let her know that she was getting to me. Kids are really an open book and very observant and can be lurking around any corner to listen to what you have to say, so that is why it is soÂ important not to say anything until after she leaves and don't show any type of emotion whether it be a facial gesture, sigh, change in body language...nothin when she pops up with a my mommy says statement. I basically killed my husband's ex with kindness and I don't know if it was myÂ kindness or how I reacted, but after awhile, she came around and like I said, we became friends and the three of us are able to work together and do what is in the best interest of the kids.Â  First off, my sympathies, because I know how you feel.

					LaShae Boone is Santonio Holmes Baby Mama				
 At 24 years old, Steeler Wide Receiver Santonio Holmes is already the father of three children. Two are with his high school sweetheart, Nicole King, and one with LaShae Boone who is his youngest childâs baby mama. Read about her and see a photo below.   LaShae Boone  LaShae and Santonio kept a low âcoupleâ profile. We didnât find them at glamorous events or charitable soirees. We didnât find LaShae on a famous designerâs runway, as we often do other NFL wives and girlfriends.  We did find them in a Florida court. LaShae filed charges of domestic violence and assault against Holmes in June 2006. By December 2006, charges were dropped when Holmes agreed to receive âcounseling.â What kind of counseling is not known. Their daughter, Sanyia, was just a few months old at the time the charges were filed. It seem LaShae and Santonio have an on-and-off relationship.  Santonio is not exactly a shy guy, but heâs keeping a lid on his recent love life. Slated to perform big in the coming Super Bowl XLIII, February 1, 2009, Holmes says he is focused on the game.  Santonio Holmes, Pittsburgh Steelers Wide Receiver  Headlines say Holmes can make history in this Super Bowl. Glory can be found in Bowl 43 with a punt return for a touchdown. Santonio Holmes may be just the man to do it. Holmes returned a punt for 67 yards against the San Diego Chargers, known for their admirable punt coverage, as well as a 25 yard punt return against the Ravens in the AFC Championship. The Cardinals on the other hand have Steve Breaston who scored his very first career TD in September on a 73-yard punt return againstâ¦the Pittsburgh Steelers â although, in general, the Cardinals are considered to have less than admirable punt coverage. Maybe a Super Bowl XLIII ring will bring Santonio a new woman. Comments are closed.

  Taylor Stein, the mother of EstÃ©e Lauder CEO William Lauder's love child, is going to court to get him to pay a $9.5 million settlement he agreed to in exchange for her silence. On February 17, Stein's lawyer, Ed Hayes, filed a petition with a New York court which oversees trust funds, seeking to force out William's brother, Silicon Valley venture capitalist Gary Lauder, as its trustee. A court date has been set for March 20. Update: After the publication of this post, a lawyer representing William Lauder contacted us. We made a few updates to the post, where appropriate, to note their concerns. Advertisement  The complaint has emails (see below) sent by William, going by the handle "Dancing Bear," to Stein's "Debutramp" account. Debutramp is the name of an autobiographical novel that Stein, daughter of a well-known New York nightclub owner Howard Stein, is writing. Hayes's petition, which includes the original settlement agreement which Stein and Lauder signed in 2007, is posted here.

 William, part of the mostly despicable Lauder clan, resigned agreed to step down within two years from his post as CEO of the family-owned cosmetics empire in favor of a successor shortly after the New York Post revealed the existence of Lauder's daughter in 2007. (His successor, Fabrizio Freda, is currently president and COO, and is expected to take over Lauder's job this year.) The Post noted Stein's history of dating rich olds and reported negotiations over the settlement agreement, which was completed in November of that year. Stein agreed to move to California and not disclose the identity of Djuna's father to anyone, even Djuna herself. Sponsored

  The only hitch: William, who has two daughters with his wife, Karen, apparently decided he had to meet his new daughter. Last year, he flew to Los Angeles to visit Stein and Djuna. Hayes, Stein's lawyer, says Karen Lauder learned of the visit and ordered William not to contact his daughter or her mother again â yet, according to emails filed with the court petition, he continued to correspond with her. William then asked Stein to fly with Djuna to New York, according to Hayes. They met in the Pierre Hotel, Hayes said, where William's father, Leonard Lauder, saw Stein and Djuna. (Lauder's lawyer says that Leonard and Stein did not meet in the Pierre, and that William did not arrange the meeting. Hayes agrees on the latter point. In an interview, he described the meeting as a "coincidence.") Evelyn Lauder, William's mother, then learned of her granddaughter's existence and met presence in town and asked to meet her â a demand William found hard to refuse because, according to Hayes, she is ill from cancer. (Lauder is a noted breast-cancer survivor who has raised considerable money for cancer research. William's emails to Stein mention his mother's illness but do not specify the ailment. His lawyer say Evelyn Lauder does not have cancer.) Karen then reportedly demanded Stein and Djuna stay out of New York. According to Stein's petition, Karen threatened to divorce William. Hayes believes that Karen is less concerned about William seeing Djuna than her mother-in-law getting to know the child. Here's why: If Evelyn and Leonard Lauder write Djuna into their will, Karen's daughters will get a smaller cut of the family's estimated $3 billion fortune. Advertisement  What makes William's actions seem especially cold: At the same time that he was sending tender-hearted emails to Stein, he was having his brother Gary move to cut off payments from her trust. Here are William and Stein's emails:     In her email, Lauder's lawyer writes: William Lauder is in complete compliance with his obligation to his youngest daughter. No payments due to the child by William Lauder have been "cut off;" to the contrary, he has made every payment he is obligated to pay. The dispute between Ms. Stein and William Lauder arises from Ms. Stein's failure to comply with her obligations under an agreement. In the court petition Hayes filed for Stein, he writes: William is now claiming that the encounters between his parents and Djuna are in breach of the Settlement Agreement, a ridiculous claim formulated to avoid his future payment obligations and to appease his wife, Karen, who threatens an immensely expensive divorce if William continues interacting with Ms. Stein and Djuna.

      Akonâs Babyâs Mama Says She Canât Serve Him With Papers â Threatens To Take Ad In L.A. Times  Related Akon's baby's mother is prepared to go to extraordinary lengths to get the singer to pay up on his child support. Farrah Coleman, the mother of the singer/producer's youngest son, alleges that she's tried numerous times to serve Akon with legal papers, but can't seem to find him. So, she's threatening to take out an ad in the Los Angeles Times to get his attention. Despite her claims, the singer/producer was spotted by TMZ paparazzi who questioned him regarding the matter, to which Akon say he wasn't hard to find. "I'm a celebrity," Akon told TMZ cameras. "My schedule is on the Internet. You can go on my MySpace, it'll tell you where I'm at!" Via, his lawyer, Akon claims that he's trying to handle the matter privately, and has been cooperative in doing so thus far. "Akon has taken responsibility and has been extremely cooperative and proactive in handling this private matter," said his lawyer in a statement back in July. "Paternity was only established just over 30 days ago. Since the case was filed outside of Georgia jurisdiction, where he is a legal resident, Akon is currently in the process of engaging counsel in California and will continue to handle this matter in a timely manner." The singer reportedly raked in around $20 million last year, so money isn't a problem. He's is the owner of the Kon Live record label, home to pop princess Lady Gaga.  More proof that money will make a woman sleep with anybody. Akon isn't to far behind Flav and Wayne in the ugly negro department. WHY ARE SOME WOMEN SOOOOOOOOO EAGER TO HAVE YOUR CHILD BUT THEN WHEN THINGS DON'T WORK OUT THEY MAKE IT OUT TO BE A MISSION IN LIFE TO DESTROY AND EMBARRASS YOU TO THE FULLEST LENGHT??????

Im still laughing at George's comment These guys need to more careful the women don't make kids by themselves. And these cats should know it's their money that attracts these women. If they honestly tell you what their women looked like before the fame , you would know, what's real. Another gold digger on a mission He's married with wife and kids. Very disrespectable to his family. I wouldn't put up wit that sh!t no matter how much $ he got! why are men so eager to flash some $$ and flaunt expensive cars to get a woman but once he has her he feigns surprise when a baby gets in the mix. whether these women "use their coochies as meal tickets" or not, men need to take care of their responsibilities.

I'm a stepmom with baby mama issues Comments (10) Badge nomination  Related Photo Clubs Please sign in Get Help Membership & Newsletters BabyCenter Shortcuts BabyCenter Mobile Our U.S. Sites Our International Sites Sorry this is so longâ¦ BMD: baby mama drama, BM: baby mama, SD: Stepdaughter My husband and I have been married for a year and a half. We are expecting our first child together. A little girlâ¦ I am about 6 and a half months pregnant. My husband is a great man, he is 8 years older than me and so devoted to me. However when he was 19 he got his girlfriend pregnant. He asked her to marry him, she refused. When I asked him why he didnât use protection he says he thought they would be together forever. She just didnât appreciate him. So when their daughter was a year old they split. There was no custody agreement, no child support. He didnât send money consistently from years 1-5 because he took care of his daughter part time and would get her whatever she needed when she was with him. From 5 years old to 8 (now) he has sent money consistently every two weeks like voluntary child support. And since we got married he has been sending more. We waited a year to get pregnant because we wanted this experience to be completely different than when he had his first child. We wanted to be responsible and prepared. BM has been married for about 3-4 years and lives in Miami. My hubby and I are active duty military serving in Alaska. When we told BM and SD that we were pregnant, SD was very excited and BM congratulated us. I was very surprised when we asked BM when/if we could get SD for the summer she agreed. So we started saving our money for SDâs trip up here 4 months ago. Plane ticket, bed, mattress, bedding, summer day camp, and a couple road trips. 2 months ago BM changed her mind. SD was not going to be allowed to fly up here with the escort the airline provides. The only way SD was going to visit for the summer was if we bought her round trip ticket and had hubby fly down to Miami, stay for a night in a hotel, pick SD up, fly her to Alaska. Then on the return trip fly her back to Miami, stay a night there again and then fly back to Alaska. The already $3000 trip was going to be costing us $5000 if we had to do things that way. We are saving for a baby, how could we afford it??? Somehow my hubby got her to calm down and change her mindâ¦ but every couple weeks after that there was the drama of her changing her mind again, me freaking out that SD couldnât come up, and my hubby calming BM down and getting her to go back to the original planâ¦ until last week. We put the tickets on hold and forwarded the itinerary to BM to be sure it would work out. We got a phone call from her : NO, I AM MAKING THE FINAL DECISION SHE WILL NOT GO UP THERE UNLESS YOU COME DOWN HERE AND PICK HER UP. So here I am pregnant and being stressed out week in and week out to finally have to deal with my poor husbandâs sad defeated face. He thinks we canât afford it, he doesnât want to take money and time away from this baby for his daughter. He doesnât want this baby to have to suffer as his daughter already has. So he was done, he told me we would just have to see SD next year when we could afford it. I take care of our finances and I knew we could do it if I just tweaked the budget a bit. I let him know we could do it. He was still upset because he doesnât think he should have to sacrifice so muchâ¦ But he called BM and told her we would bow to her wishes. But this time there was another issue, surprise, surprise. My dear Mother-In-Law had called BM and told her that she didnât trust the airline escort program either and whatâs more she didnât trust her son and I to take care of her granddaughter (my husbandâs daughter!). Well somehow we got to the bottom of this, made a compromise and the hubby is flying to SDâs first layover, and then flying back here to Alaska. Just the halfway deal, which we can deal with. Its an extra $1150 but my hubby really needs to see his daughter and I want to meet her before baby sis comes along in August. Needless to say the hubby is not very happy with his mom and hasnât talked to her since this incident. Prior to that we didnât have any issues with herâ¦ Anyways, we bought the tickets. However, yesterday morning I got a call at 0430am! Being in the military and in Alaska with that volcano a call that early can mean a lot and none of it good. However once I jumped out of bed woke up my husband to help me find my phone and checked my messages guess who it was? BM calling to say she would appreciate me emailing her the hubbyâs itineraries. I already had sent her her daughterâs however she apparently didnât trust me when I told her I bought the hubbyâs tickets and he would meet SD halfway through the trip. I texted her back asking her to please consider the time next time she called, asked her what reason would I have to lie to her about the flights, and promised to forward the itineraries at a decent hour. Her reply was next time I call I expect you to cooperate and I donât trust you at all and have your husband call me. I sucked up after that saying I meant no disrespect and it was really early. She didnât reply or apologize to me or anything. However when she called my husband later on yesterday she apologized to him for calling so early. Why couldnât she apologize to me??? Last but definitely not least we called his daughter last week to talk to her about her upcoming trip. He talked to her first then he asked her if she wanted to talk to me she, she said yes. So I asked her how she was, if she was excited about coming up here etc. We got off the phone and not even 3mins later BM calls us back yelling: MY DAUGHTER IS NOT TALKING TO THAT WOMAN AGAIN, SHE IS NOT GOING UP THERE THE TRIP IS OFF! Apparently SD lied to her mother, telling her I had said that I was mad at someone in her family when we were on the phone together. Obviously I didnât say anything like that, I know what to say and what not to say in front of an 8 year old child. I think all this drama and worry has been affecting BM and she has been getting upset with me over it. Therefore her daughter is lying about me and making me out to be the bad person. I just donât know how this will pan out once SD gets up here and we meet for the first timeâ¦ EEEEK Help with advice please, this is my first BMD experience. Alexandria (20) Active Duty Airwoman; wife to my dear Active Duty Airman *Mark (28)* mother to *Allana Jeanae* (8/20/09) stepmother to *Niah* (2/19/01) I would say I would not be comfortable with an 8 yr old flying by herself from Miami to Alaska. That is a very long trip. I think husband needs to be the one to deal with his ex and childcare issues. he is the dad. I think the BM might not like having to go through you. It is weird that BM keeps changing her mind about the trip. I would be prepared for SD to freak out and want to go home early. I agree with PP. Â I have huge BMD issues and believe that it is best if BF handles all of it since they are his children. Â If I got involved, it would cause more problems. Â  It also seems that their arrangement concerning visitation and support payments has worked in the past, but may not be working anymore. Â He may want to consider having a lawyer draw up some kind of proper document that would spell out a specific visitation schedule and who is responsible for paying for the child's travel because I don't think it should all fall on you. Â The mother should contribute as well. Â With a visitation agreement in place, it would at least guarantee your husband would see his child despite BM's whims. Lauren Isaiah~Aug.'09 Myla~Dec. '14 I'm a step-mom too and my biggest advice is visit (and post if you'd like) the Step Parents *The Original* board!Â  I live on it and the girls there are very honest with their opinions and advice!Â  (Sometimes too honest at times I guess but they're wonderful and very supportive when you need to vent and are looking for answers!)Â  :) Amy, married to Ryan 8/19/08 DSS 10 Baby Ayden born August 13, 2009 I didn't begin dealing with her until she wasn't getting the picture from my Husband, I don't talk to her unless I have to or unless she specifically asks to talk to me. I am as much a part of this child's life as her father, or at least I should be and he agreesÂ and BM just needs to understand that. Alexandria (20) Active Duty Airwoman; wife to my dear Active Duty Airman *Mark (28)* mother to *Allana Jeanae* (8/20/09) stepmother to *Niah* (2/19/01) I just don't understand my DH. I posted my situation on Legaladvice.com and got a call and a free consultation from a lawyer in SD's state of residence. He explained everything to me and I agreed with him completely that we should get visitation in writing. Hubby disagrees, or at least he isn't agreeing right now. He thinks if this summer visit goes well BM will bend to our wishes next time, yeah right! Everything will be on her terms and I know it, and even if she does bend a little why do WE have to be the ones to go through the fear of her changing her mind? Or thinking we saved enough and then having to pay more every year? The lawyer said we wouldn't be caught paying for the last 8 years worth of child support because she NEVER claimed, though she easily could have. I don't know what else to do with him. I guess I'll just have to wait for him to see the light, to see that having things in writing is the best thing for SD. He says that because BM hasn't filed child support and had faith in our paying he shouldn't disrespect her by filing for custody. It would be a different matter if we didn't pay the child support. But we do. What would filing for child support do for her besides maybe providing security or peace of mind... I don't care if she files, but he does, I don't know why... I know we pay the amount she would claim for so I just don't know. It wouldn't be disrespectful to take her to court for custody because that would be in the best interest of SD, unlike going in for child support, because we already provide that. I tried to explain that to him. She is provided for and cared for. however she does not get to see her daddy that much, and the only time she gets to now is when? When its according to BM's terms and costing us $3000 a trip!!!! I told him we should try to work something out with her first but if she doesn't listen or doesn't agree to fly halfway herself next time... we should go to court as plan B. He said I'll think about it.... What is there to think about though? UGH! I just don't know. I don't want MY daughter to be pulled into all this stress with BM and SD I want it done in writing and no longer DRAMA! I wish he would understand and see how much better that would be. No more calming BM down and convincing her and weedling and trying to sweettalk her into letting her daughter fly up here in an affordable way. NO MORE with a court order! He just doesn't understand. Wouldn't it be better though, for all of us, the whole family, especially SD and new baby coming? UGH! Alexandria (20) Active Duty Airwoman; wife to my dear Active Duty Airman *Mark (28)* mother to *Allana Jeanae* (8/20/09) stepmother to *Niah* (2/19/01) I'm sorry this has been so hectic. I'm not speaking from experience, but only as an objective observer: You *need* to get agreements in writing, and, if necessary, have the law to back you up.Â  Spending $3K on plane tickets is waaaaay too much for one woman to get snippy and call the whole thing off on the slightest whim.Â  I can completely understand wanting to have someone the child knows escorting her from Miami to Alaska.Â  However, it's NOT okay for her to call the whole thing off on a whim with no legal recourse. Your hubby needs to stand up for his rights, because they sound entirely reasonable.Â  But if he thinks that appeasing her now is going to lead to her being more amiable in the future...he's dead wrong.Â  Human nature doesn't work like that.Â  People enjoy being in control.Â  Many enjoy the power of seeing others suffer simply because they have the power to do so.Â  And I'm sure there's a bit of jealousy on her part that you two are having a child together.Â  Even if the emotions aren't there, some people love the thought that "yeah, you may be his wife, butÂ *I'm* theÂ mother of his only child!"Â  Now that it's no longer the case, she's going to get what satisfaction she can from him.Â  Unless your hubby stands up for himself and his rights, she will be more than happy to step on his toes for as long as she can legally do so.Â  He should stop being naive and take steps to ensure these hissy fits don't happen again. Jennifer (Age 39) Married to Leo (Age 45) since 2002 Zoe Rose is here!Â  :)Â  DOB: August 16th, 2009Â  (Due date was August 20th). Assuming that SD did fib and tell a story about you being angry (the ex could have made that up or drawn it out of her, certainly possible) An adult reaction would not have been to fly off the handle but to call DH and find out what happened. Adults check the facts before going ballistic. Just a thought. Recent development: Hubby will TRY to keep things civil with her with no court, though he KNOWS exactly how skeptical I am about trusting this woman. We reached a compromise. We will write up our own agreement with her, if she has trouble following that THEN we will reconsider going to court. He DOES NOT WANT TO. He honestly thinks NOT going to court is what is best for his daughter. I don't understand, not after what her mother would say in front of her. Telling her one week you're gonna see you're daddy, then the next week he can't afford it. Then the next week, you're gonna be with an escort and see you're daddy, then after that, nope he'll fly down here or you won't see him! I agreed with his decision for now and thanked him for at least considering going to court and for agreeing to having a time-sharing agreement at least informally written up between them, just to see how well it works. We're going to see our counselor on Wednesday, I hope she'll perhaps tell him the benefits of having it be official. I just don't want my dear baby girl to have to be thrown into this mess once she arrives. Only seeing her sister when her sister's mom sees fit and gets her own way.  Alexandria (20) Active Duty Airwoman; wife to my dear Active Duty Airman *Mark (28)* mother to *Allana Jeanae* (8/20/09) stepmother to *Niah* (2/19/01) Girl, I totally feel you on this. Â Do you ever wonder, would I act this crazy if I were her, or what made my DH attracted to this psycho in the first place? Â Cause I do daily about my situation. Â I will email you the story. Â  Also, I just make sure I have nothing to do with. Â I monitor the situation, but he can do all the talking. Â I have no desire to speak to her and I trust him, so I'm not worried.

Lil Wayneâs Baby Mama Drama: Lauren London AND Nivea Are Pregnant by Weezy Rihanna Had a Huge Meltdown Before the Grammys, and Thatâs Why She Canceled Her Performance? Watch âThe People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Storyâ Episode 3 Minnie From âLittle Women Atlantaâ Pregnant With Pastor Troyâs Baby Taylor Swift Responded to Kanye West in the Best Way Possible at the Grammys Watch Justin Bieberâs 2016 Grammys Performance (ft. Skrillex & Diplo): âLove Yourselfâ and âWhere Are Ã Nowâ MORE POP CULTURE LIKE US ON FACEBOOK  So it looks like Lil Wayne has been running around town raw and getting industry chicks pregnant â¦ and apparently heâs caught himself in what some would call a âlove triangle.â According to several (confirmed) recent reports, actress Lauren London AND singer Nivea, who recently went through a divorce from singer/songwriter The Dream, whom she already has 3 kids with, are expecting babies from Weezy! Talk about drama! But anyway, both ladies are having boys and we hear both of them are about 5/6 months along. And youâve probably already guessed it but Ms. London is in no way happy about this news. Peep what our boy FreddyO said. I was told Lauren London was at a loss for words today after finding out that her baby daddy was expecting another child.  Lauren who is almost 6 months pregnant  didnât know anything about Niveaâs pregnancy, and found out via Mediatakeout.com (go figure) and was outraged.  Like every other star these days, she took to her Twitter page to express how she felt. But after speaking to a family friend left the topic alone. She then decided to spend the day with her family and close friends.  Lauren told her friends that she is worried if her career is over as a result of these issues.  As we all know Lauren is on the pinnacle of Black Hollywood as the face of Sean John and reoccurring role in the remake of Beverly Hills 90210 on the CW.   A reliable source stated that Wayne doesnât want anything to do with Lauren. Today Nivea called  Ryan Cameronâs show and confirmed that she is indeed pregnant with a boy.  In fact, both of them are pregnant with Wayneâs sons.  This is a really bad situation, considering that she is knocked up and the baby daddy is in love with someone else.  Lauren London can have any man in the world but she chooses to get with an engaged manâ¦ Is the recession effecting men too!!!!   This makes Wayne about 4 babies up and 4 baby mamas down.  I guess it is true about Wayne â¦ He can f*&^k any girl in this world. Check out Locked Up: Celebs Who Have Done Hard Time  by Gossip On This at Mode damn lauren man you can have any man you want you just had to fuck the diease man the junky yo baby boy gone come out ughly ass fuck and then how you gone get mad at the fact that he had got somebody else pregnant i mean think b4 you do stuff and how wayne gone have a house with all 3 of dem in 1 house if he dont want anything to do with london lol THIS SHIT IS TOO MUCH WEEZY GET IT TOGETHER DAMNNNNNNNNNNNN LONDON WRAP IT UP NEXT OR MAYBE IT WONT BE A NEXT TIME AND SINCE HE DONT WWANT NOTHING TO YOU LONDON I WOULDNT NAME THE BABY AFTER HIM â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.THAT GOES FOR ANYBODY ESPEACILLY THESE NIGGAS IF YOU DONT WANT A BABY MAMA CALLIN YO PHONE EVERY 5 MIN PUT ON A RUBBER A reliable source stated that Wayne doesnât want anything to do with Lauren. This here is funny to meâ¦ U wanted to be bothered when u could get it.  I think you mad because she didnât want to be apart of the entourage.  Nobody knew about her for real until she popped up.  I by no means think that Lauren is slow, but accidents do happen.  It just pisses me off that he would say that he donât want to have anything to do with her, but you didnât want her to get an  abortion. People are crazyâ¦Like he said, he got the best HEAD on this earth.  Donât he know that alone could get 2-6 babies? *{good luck on ur baby}* lil wyane is still my baby and he need to be with nivea lil wayne is ugly ass fuck looks like and with those tattos is fuck up why did lauren london wantto have sex with him knowing h could get any girl he wants MISS LAUREN I LOVE ATL G U MY GIRL BUT SORRY BOUT UR BABY DADDY  HEâS MY BOY BUT HE GOT U & NAVEA KNOCK  UP GIRL DO UR THIN AND TAKE CARE OF UR BABY I KNOW HE GOING TAKE CARE OF HIS BABIES AND HIS WOMEN hay i love lauren london no matta jus take care of u n yur new son be he mom n dad fuk wayne Arenât all these people afraid of contracting sexually transmitted infections or worse HIV.

WITH HER FAT SLOPPY ASS. lil wayne ainât shit period if u ask me!!!!!! now he donât want to be bothered with lauren london now that she is pregnant cause he is engaged he must dont love nivea that much if him and lauren was getting it inâ¦â¦ Lauren u will be fine keep your head and put wayne nasty dick ass on child supportâ¦â¦â¦.. It is really sad that our men canât stick with just one woman.  Most unfortunate when money is involved it seems to go to our heads and our egos. Signed, Jacquelyn Lil Wayne may not be the most attractive man in the world, or the most responsible when it comes to practicing safe sex, but I donât agree that we should dog the man out and basically throw dirt on his name as a unfit father is a bit much. Two adult women agreed to have unprotected sex with him, that led to them getting pregnant. Lil Wayne actually happens to take good care of his kids and the mothers have no complaints. In addtion, if the comment is true that he did state that he did not want to have anything to do with Lauren London, i see nothing wrong with it, he did not state that he did not want to know or have relationship with his son; he stated he did not want one with lauren. shit  happens, now everyone has to accept the consequences and move on. man lauren london is waynes second prettiest babymama.. n he is in love wiff nieva ugly a**.. sorry wezzy.. yur mha biggest fan buth dhat jus turned mii offth dhat yuh goth 4baby mamamzâ¦. dhat meanz yuh dnt kn how twe control yur slefâ¦ lauren london is jus needs twe relize dhat wezzy aint gnna changeâ¦ evn doe the source says dhat he is a good father(TRUE)â¦ buth anywayz wezzy trap on next time LIL WAYNE I LOVE YA I DONT THANK IT WRONG LONGS YOU TAKE KARE YOUR BABIES BT LARUEN LONDON THATS MAH GURL>>>>>> NIVIEA SHE ALRITE BT SHE OLD SHE AIN TIN STYLE NO MOE 1st, Ewwwwww!

Top 10 Bible Studies 2015 Bible Study Basics: Galatians What Every Leader Can Learn from Pope John Paul II When Believers Break Up How to Effectively Witness How Can I Be Sure I'm Saved? Is Heaven Here or There? I was looking for proof that God hears our prayers when I came across a young woman with a very powerful story. What's your prayer story? I'd been married for a long time, but wasn't able to have any childrenâthat's a big deal where I come from. To make matters worse, my husband's other wife, Peninnah, had a whole truckload of kids. His other wife? Yes. That's another common cultural thing where I come from. My lack of kids didn't bother me too much at first, because I was my hubby's favorite wife. But things got really tough when Peninnah turned out to be a human vending machine for sons and daughters. Because there weren't enough bathrooms in the house? Noâalthough that's true, now that you mention it. The real problem was that Peninnah was so mean about the whole thing. She would tease me mercilessly about my inability to have children. If your husband loved you most, why didn't he do anything to help? He tried to, I guess. He used to give me twice as much dinner as he gave the other wife and her kidsâthat made me feel a little better. But he didn't really understand. He would say, "Why are you so sad? You've got me, and that's better than having 10 kids!" He sounds like quite a catch. So is that when you started praying? Yes. Peninnah was laying it on especially thick one day, and I just couldn't take it any more. So I ran out of the house, toward the temple, and started praying as hard as I could. I even made a promise to God. I told him that if I could just have a son, I would dedicate him to serving in the temple his whole life. Sounds like you were serious. Yep. My prayer even attracted the attention of the High Priest, Eli. Did he come over to congratulate you for your faith? Um â¦ not exactly. Actually, he told me to stop drinking so much wine. I guess he thought I was drunk by the way I was praying. But I wasn't. Are you sure you weren't a little tipsy? Maybe your husband gave you a double portion of "drinky drinky" along with dinner? No, he did not! My face was red and puffy from crying, that's all. And I was praying silently, so he saw my lips moving and thought I'd gone nutty and was talking to myself. But once I explained everything, he understood. And then he blessed my prayer. So don't go spreading any rumors about me in that little article of yours. Then what happened? God gave me a wonderful son not even a year later. I named him Samuel and kept my promise. I dedicated my boy to the Lord and he eventually became the next High Priest after Eli passed away. SamuelâI like that name! What made you choose it? I wanted to always remember how God answered my prayer, and Samuel is pretty similar to the Hebrew phrase that means "I asked God for him." So I just connected the dots. I'm glad you did; my name is Samuel, too! Oh, yeah? I guess we can both be thankful that God answers our passionate prayersâeven if others think we're a little out of control. Want to learn more about this mystery character? Check out 1 Samuel 1:1-2:11. And for more insights into the power of persistent prayer, see Luke 18:1-8.

						Ad Choices   Urlacher Pushes Back Against Baby Mama's Accusations Linebacker and ex-girlfriend continue to fight. Their son loses.  By                                                                                       John Ness    NEWSLETTERS  Receive the latest sports  updates in your inbox 
 WATCH LIVE Watch Live: NBC 5 News Share Chicago star linebacker Brian Urlacher, no great fan of the media, gave an interview to the ChicagoÂ Tribune to clear up some of the accusations hisÂ former girlfriendÂ made this week. Urlacher and Tyna Robertson have a three-year old son, Kennedy, together. But the two are far from friendly. In the past 48 hours, we've learned: 
Urlacher dresses his son in Cinderella diapers and paints his toenails Bears blue.Â Robertson told an Illinois courtÂ she was worried these acts were "confusing [Kennedy], if he's a boy or a girl." 
God gave Urlacher a career-damaging bad back to punish him for being a bad father. At least, that's Robertson's logic, according to a text message Urlacher shared with the Tribune. 
 Urlacher isn't blameless in keeping this story alive.Â He's alleged to have sentÂ extremely hostile text messagesÂ of his own, accusing Robertson of turning their son into, yes, a gender-confused child. There's a sad pattern here. UrlacherÂ dismissed the suggestion that he's confused his three-year oldÂ (!)Â son: "She says to me, 'If he turns out to be gay, it's your fault,' " Urlacher said. "I told her, 'I don't care if he's gay. I'll love him either way.' " It's a nice sentiment, but a more meaningful statement would be to stop feeding the beast.Â If Urlacher did receive those text messages about his back, he should know that showing them to the media doesn't help his son any. Young Kennedy probably doesn't know how to use Google yet, but when he does, he'll learn that all these statements will remain attached to his name long after his parents' custody battle is over.

			CELEBRITIES That's $10 for an entire year! Kelis and Nas have managed to go a few months without news about their divorce hitting the tabloids, but the peaceful facade has finally cracked as news of court-ordered support payments, attempted reconciliation and pending custody battles hit today.
 
The couple is in court right now, battling out their divorce case. First up was Nas, 36, being court ordered to increase his monthly support payments from $40,000 to $51,000. But it wasn't all bad news for Nas: The judge also ruled that he no longer has to pay $13,000 a month for the former couple's Los Angeles home.
 
Kelis, 30, admitted during her testimony that the couple attempted to reconcile in September of this year, but unfortunately, it didn't work out. Nas took the stand after the "Milkshake" singer and testified that he wants overnights with his son. Kelis has sole custody for now, but Nas wants more quality time with his baby Knight, born to the rapper and boricua pop star on July 22, 2009.
 
Kelis and Nas were married in 2005 and broke up in April of this year.

					Baby MAMA Drama!				 Baby MAMA Drama! Recent Posts Newsletter Alberto Hertz says: Olen Konczewski says: Rolf Chant says: mercedes philadelphia says: Recently I was talking with a friend of mine who is a well known athlete.Â  HeÂ was lookingÂ rather angry when I saw him, so I asked what was going on.Â  He told me he was angry because he is paying hisÂ babyâs mamaÂ $30,000 a month, and she wonât let him see his son.Â  I just couldnât believe it.Â  This child support thing is getting out of hand.Â  Now before I get on my soap box and start preaching about the injustices of the family court system, let me just stop right there.Â  That is not what this blog is about.Â  See, my friend said to me, âDon, if she comes up missing, I didnât do it!âÂ  So men, how do we deal with BMD!Â  First we must start with Prayer.Â  1 John 1:9 says if we confess our sins, God is faithful to forgive us and cleanse us.Â  See we must realize that the only reason we have BMD, is because of our sin.Â  Then after we confess we need to pray for the childs mother.Â  One of the hardest things to admit is that as evil as she may be, Jesus died for her too. After prayer, we need lots of patience.Â  It is our nature as men to retaliate when we are attacked.Â  James 1:19 says, Be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry.Â  Why, verse 20 says, because mans anger does not bring about a righteous life.Â  When we are angry, nothing good can come from it. Â Next it will take perseverance.Â  Most baby mamaâs are using the child as a pawn to get back at the fathers for the pain that they themselves feel.Â  Romans 12 gives a lot of instruction in this area of how toÂ persevere.Â  Specifically verse 18, if it is possible, as much as depends on you, live peaceabley with all people. Many men find that there is truth to the statement, hellÂ has no furry like a womans scorn, that is why if we are dealing with BMD, we need to alsoÂ try to stayÂ positive.Â  Nothing good can come of bad mouthing your ex in front of or to your child.Â  Our words come directly from our thought life.Â  Philippians 4:8 tells us to think about only what is true, noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable and praise worthy.Â  Thinking of ways to tear down your ex is a complete waiste of time. Finally, it takes persistence when dealing with baby mama drama.Â  Why?Â  Because it is easy to throw up our hands and say Iâve had it.Â  If we do this, our children will end up suffering the most.Â  Exodus 20:5 says the sins of the father are passed to the third and the fourth generation.Â  But verse 6 says, the blessings of the father is to a thousand generations. In the end the main verse of scripture that comes to mind, is the same one I offered my friend going through this difficult situation;Â  Galatians 6:9 Do not grow weary in well doing, because you will reap a harvest if you do not give up.

She made it clear to us what the situation was between her and Tank:  (Iâd like the chance to respond)  Durrell Babbs and I have a son together.  His name was changed in the last two months of my pregnancy by his father (it was always his option to name him as he saw fit).  Also around that time I learned that another woman was also carrying his child.  As opposed to communicating the truth, Mr. Babbs opted to remain silent. That  seems to be the way he handles situations that make him uncomfortable.  Or he simply chooses a lie over the truth.  As he has done in our situation.   He sayâs our son was not a mistake, yet it sounds that way despite his clever, yet juvenile disclaimer.  Let it be known that our son was not a surprise to either of us.   In 2006 he asked me twice to consider having a child  with him.  Cleary, I eventually said yes.  It was the best discussion I ever made.  Durrell Babbs Jr. has brought so much joy into my life.  Sometimes I wonder how I was able to exist without him in the first place. Had it not been for the fact, that someone I called a friend betrayed my trust.  No one would have known the name of my childâs father (outside of our families and close friends).  Not saying itâs wrong for people to do press releases and things of that nature.   And the main reason Iâm sharing these words now is because, I will not be made out to be some one night stand or someone that sought to trap a  man with pregnancy.  I have always and will continue to be a woman of independence.  If Mr. Babbs hates me as he has proclaimed (wonder if I make him sick too  â LOL )?  Flashback just now to when mom made me mad.  Anyway, If he feels as he does we didnât have to connect again in an intimate manner after we learned of our childâs existence.  Just a thought. I donât hate Durrell.  I just wish he were a man that kept promises.  I would like for my child to have âA Real Fatherâ â his words.  One that couldnât fall asleep on any given night, not knowing if his child were OK and his needs were being met.  It is my preference that they not be strangers.  He sayâs he loves my son.  I want him to prove it.  A monetary commitment does not a father make.   Angry was not the way to handle his lack of communication.  However, after utilizing all normal forms  of communication, I made a bad decision. Who knew this man, would go the route he did.  Perhaps, some good can come out of it in the end.  To Durrell Sr., I apologize for making you feel like you had to go into attack mode.  However, at the same time, I will not tolerate lies being placed on my head and around the life of my child.  As I have always stated before the door is wide open for you to be the father you said you would like to be to our son.  Our immature burst on the net doesnât change that.  Granted Iâm very disappointed  right now and probably wonât believe a word you say for a while.  But thatâs how trust works â¦ you have to earn it.   I am a great mother and you should know your son is reaping the benefits of that fact.  You promised he would know his family, cousins and all âem.  Letâs start with you again.  On my age and this cougar business, you never had a problem with it before.  Besides, 40 is all up side your window looking in right now.  So enjoy your âyouth.â  LOL.  For those that seek to judge me, my childâs father and act as if you have all the answers.  Know that you donât.  Otherwise you wouldnât have made mistakes, cried or experienced happiness as you have over the years.  Itâs called life.  This is my life and have no regrets. Damn, Tankâ¦ It sounds like you really need to get your sh*zzz together. Tank will be responding via Twitter in 5â¦ 4â¦ 3â¦ 2â¦ 1 she sounds smart and like she has her stuff together- itâs tough raising children and even tougher when itâs only one parent. Tank should handle his business and not let this type of stuff end up on twitter and the blogs for all of us to comment onâ¦man- wear a rubber if you donât want to take of care of your kidsâ¦come on- the rubbers they have out now, itâs like itâs a second skinâ¦ this is quite immature and unnecessary on the part of both of them. Itâs ok to move forward and look for a man who can be a better figure in her sonâs life if that is what this is really about. ohh 3rd to comment! These people need to grow up and stop using Twitter as a sounding board to their person problems (Tank). Take care of your business in the privacy of your life. This is ridiculous! I tip my hate to Alysse Stewart for being the adult in this whole mess, and focusing on taking care of her child. Men! correction: âI tip my HAT to Alysee Stewartâ¦â I think they are both being very childish. I however love the fact that she writes (speaks) proper English. She is just trying to get some kind of shine b/c Tank called her out via twitter.  I have heard she is crazy and just trying to make herself look good on the net.  I think itâs so funny how he gave his other baby mama @zenafoster her credit if you go to his twitter page @therealtank Itâs obvious she is his favorite & they are truly friends & adults in raising their daughter Zoey together.  Maybe Alysse should reach out to Zena & ask her how to handle her situation better b/c she seems to be the Lauren London in this case & Alysse is just the Nivea. i have to disagree. she doesnât sound ignorant, she sounds resilient but she could work on punctuation. She COOL wit me â¦ i dont have a PROBLEM wit her NO MORE â¦â¦ I said wha i said but  When a Muhfka is RIGHT â¦.. THEY RIGHT!!!!!  Why are you NeGGLETâs always goin in a how she LOOK â¦.

Unfortunately for Rock, the brief liaison has dogged him ever since. Zsibrita later accused him of raping her and suggested he was the father of her child; Rock, in turn, hired Anthony Pellicano to investigate Zsibrita and was forced to testify about his relationship with the disgraced private eye at his wiretapping trial last year. It doesn't appear Rock will be able to put the matter behind him anytime soon. Although no charges were ever filed against Rockâand paternity tests concluded he wasn't the father of her childâZsibrita slapped Rock with a civil suit last August, claiming that Rock forced himself on her, had dispatched Pellicano to intimidate her, and then had damaged her reputation when he talked about the case on Howard Stern's radio show. (She also disputes the results of the paternity test.) The court documents were sealed when the suit was originally filed last year, but a judge lifted the seal late last week. We've obtained the court papers, and you can have a look at the raunchy allegations for yourself after the jump.

Kill it! Kill it! Cristal Taylor, the former fiancÃ©e of Dirk Nowitzki, was sentenced earlier today in circuit court in St. Charles, Missouri to five years in prison for violating her probation. Cristal A. Taylor, 38, a St. Louis-area native, appeared this morning in circuit court in St. Charles. She admitted that she failed to check in with her probation officer and that she was arrested twice in Texas in 2000 for misdemeanors.
 The arrest brought to light her criminal record, including a St. Charles County case from 1997 in which Taylor was accused of forgery and stealing. She pleaded guilty in 1999 and was placed on probation. She also has an outstanding warrant for violating probation in a St. Louis County bad check case. Police have tied Taylor to a string of aliases. What I would like to know is what did Nowitzki ever see in her, other than she was an uglier man than he was, which is saying something. Sweet mamma jamma that is one homely woman. Nevertheless, Iâm not giving up on these two star-crossed lovers making a go of it again someday. Taylor was given credit for one year probation and with time served, she could be out in less than four years. Dirk will more than likely be out of the NBA after Mark Cuban realizes two years too late that Nowitzki is washed up.Â  and will be looking for someone to help him open his David Hasselhoff museum.

T-Pain's Baby Mama Wants More Money
 57 comments: Post a Comment 
The baby's mother NEEDS to go STRAIGHT to T-Pain's head and to the WHITE MEAT!!!!  If you makin' tens of thousands of dollars, HOW IN THE H are you gonna offer your child's mother a PALTRY $2,000 a MONTH and then want to increase with another MEASLY $500?  Don't get me wrong, I know that some single mothers outside of the entertainment business WISH that they could get $2,000 a month, but compared to what T-Pain is making a month AND the fact that she is ONE baby mother who hasn't tried to be all greedy with hers up in the media (the little boy is 2 and this is the FIRST I heard of him), T-Pain should afford this son the SAME entitlements as his other children (SCHOOL, LIFE INSURANCE, HEALTH INSURANCE, etc)
 
He paid way more than that for that "big ass chain" he bought I know that. If you don't want to take care of no kids, don't have no kids! and that includes that baby mama. If you don't want to take care of the bitch, don't impregnate the bitch!
 
I agree with both of you!!!He deserves whatever he gets since he had this child OUTSIDE his marriage. BTW, she's one of the chicks from that female rap show that had Khia on it. She's the one with the lisp, can't remember her name. Just curious to know...LADIES...last 2 men on earth were Wayne/TPain who'd you pick??îîî
 
I SWEAR THIS IS NOT GOSSIP WHEN A CHILD IS INVOLVED.WOW AMERICA NO MORALES.WE ALL NOW T-PAIN IS T-DEVIL AS WELL.SO WHY,FIRST OF ALL WHY THEY(HIM AND WAYNE) GETTING THIS WOMEN PREGANT  WITH THAT ALIEN SPERM,DAM DEVILS.. BAPS
 
@2:34 I WOULD RATHER KILL MY SELF THEN TO ALLOW DEMON SEMEN IN MY BODY.... BAPS
 
The mother that are talking about is Ms. Cherry that was on the female rapper show a while back. Shick is a mess - and will flaunt ech penny of his  money on foolishness for her hoodrat freinds to see. She's going back each 2 years for her increase, bes' beleive.
 
2:05Who cares what the "Father" is making? As long as your Child is Feed, Clothed & Housed what difference does it make? She was never Married to the Man. The Child isn't a green light to go nuts and demand absurd amounts of Money. A Lot of people don't make 2,500.00 a month in a pay check. So, with Her working combined with that 2,500.00 a Month She can live a comfortable life. She needs to stop being greedy before He go get 50c Lawyer. She think She can sit on Her ass and spend spend spend...NOPE
 
I don't blame her. T-pain makes $15 million a year off of royalties/collbo's etc., I'd walk away from $2500 too! Shyt, I make $1400 a month and that shyt isn't enough for me, let alone me+kid. I rarely agree with the baby mama's that ask for ridiculous amounts of money, but in this case, I think T-Pain can afford to kick up like $5-$7k a month. Afterall, wasn't this nucca bragging about spending $140k on a "BIG ASS CHAIN"? Obviously, this nucca got dough to waste! I say, take his @ss to the cleaners!
 
I know her (Tha baby mama) personally. She is not like all tha other gold diggin females.She loves her son and is just tryin to make a better life for him.
 
T Pain all day 2:34. Pain got beautifully smooth skin and he's funny. Wayne look like at gatdamn gremlin
 
@2:50, Thank you for hating so hard, for the love.AND PLEASE STOP THIS GOING UNDER DIFFERENT ANNO.I WILL NOT BE MOVED.BOSSIP IS MORE YOUR PACE OR MEDIATAKEOUT.Anyway if t-pain can afford to buy a chain that says "BIG ASS CHAIN".Then he can pay up  BAPS WILL BE HERE FOREVER GET USED TO IT...
 
Good googly moogly that's a ridiculously unattractive specimen.
 
RnB thug..please dont have children obviously you dont know the day end and day out work it takes to watch over a child, and it shouldnt be free. Women are not slaves and if they both created a child together and his dumbass wife is able to accept a philanderer then his babymom should be compensated well... or TPAIN can try to get full custody to end payments simple as pie.NIGGAS want to fuck who they want and leave their kids with no dad and no money. to me his baby mom should be getting over 100k a year..
 
Fuggin' dead @ 2:50's nic and 3pm. Hell naw LMAO LMAO
 
Huh? First off you should never expect to be compensated for RAISING YOUR CHILD! Second as I mentioned, as long as you are living comfortably you shouldn't worry about money the Man that considered you a jump off is making. I'd bet dollars to donuts She aint making no money at all. Let's be realistic here today. Does a Child eat more than 2,500.00 worth of food a month? As I said, plenty of People don't make that in a month so I'm sure She can raise Her child on 30k Per Year (tax free) Bottom Line...She's a Gold Digging Crap Ass Groupie who is out for the $$$
 
thats what he gets - fucking adulterer!
 
T-Pain: "How about you send me a list of what he needs......" Cheap ass nigga. Break bread. Its your fuckn son for crying out loud! If moms is mishandling the loot, rest assure she will get whats coming to her in the end.
 
Everyone is only jumping down his throat, which makes no sense to me. Yes, his trifling azz is wrong, for cheating on his wife, but didnt he say they invite other women into their bedroom?Now whether they do or dont, this girl didnt fuck herself. She's just as nasty and tacky as he is, for sleeping with a married man.But, if some women do it just to say they did, to feel superior to the wife, then you damn well can bet that a woman will do it if the man has money.Now, I agree that $2000 is a good bit of money to live off of, but cosidering the cost of rent, food, insurance, clothes, and whatnot, it wouldnt be unfair for her to get between $3000 and $5000, especially since he said his kids with his wife have trust funds.He's probably pissed about the boy being born. But, he has no one to blame but himself. So, they're both trife, but its fair that she gets a little more.
 
whatever happened to condoms? do people still use those?? im jus sayin...
 
should've jagged off!!!!
 
They 'bout get all in his money now.  All these industry cats claim to have the game sewed up, but when that flashlight is shined on their life, it usually reveals anything but.  1 baby momma, 2 baby mommas outside of wedlock, financial troubles, other legals issues, etc..  I know one female T-Pain BETTER remain faithful to:  AUTOTUNE
 
I HAVE absolutely NO SYMPATHY for Rich-AZZ Ignorant MARRIED MEN who choose to have UNPROTECTED SEX outside of their marriage... Hell he's lucky that HIS WIFE is a Weak-n-Dumb BROAD because I KNOW some women that would KILL THEIR HUSBAND for that kind of OffenseTRILLLOL;-)
 
^^^^^^cosign fucking 5000000000%
 
I don't feel sorry for these dumbass married kneegrow's you play, you pay. don't get married if you want to whore around.@I know one female T-Pain BETTER remain faithful to: AUTOTUNE you ain't neva lied lmbao!!
 
RnB thug is an idiot...Trying to live off 30K is hard when you have a family to feed.  Her child should be afforded the same lifestyle his other children have.  If you don't want to the child, use protection.  Don't rely on someone else to use protection, wrap it up first
 
Im pretty sure that he give's her money and still buys that little boy the same shit he buys his other kids. She need to have her own job and stop thinking that just because she had his baby she should be living like she is his wife! Plus its been two yrs if she ain't said shit this whole time then it must be somebody in her ear talking shit. If you ask me she shoulda try'd to hit that fool up when he was hot cause ain't nobody Checkin to his ass now!! DOA remember!!
 
he broke the rules, because im sure she didnt rape him. you pay for you mistakes and he must pay for his.  im so tired of stars wanting to act like a regular joe when they get in trouble. but when things are going fine they want to be above the law. you did it now you must pay.
 
I agree TC.I don't have any children but I believe if daddy living a certain lifestyle...then his seed should live the same.Don't want kids don't have kids.Do what it takes..BIRTH CONTROL!I Hear that doesn't work all the time,so be selective or better yet go sit down somewhere.No self control
 
Just curious to know...LADIES...last 2 men on earth were Wayne/TPain who'd you pick??îîî2:34 PM  Sheeeeit! Call me Lebanese 'cause 'taint no way in de HELL! LESBIANISM alllll the way baby.
 
2:44 Thud said...She needs to stop being greedy before He go get 50c Lawyer.Neither 50, nor his lawyer, have to do too much. He was GIVING her 25K per month, not including, lodging (free), and paying ALL the other amenities. She proved his case for him. Misusing funds appropriated for the child AND to this day crying broke! WTF?!

Anon1 wrote "I don't believe you had the AuDAcity, the nerve, the gall, the cajones muy grande, yo te quiero taco bell..."@Anon1 you were always my favorite....I still can't get over 50 Cent BM and that ridiculous amount of money she was getting plus the house and schooling.  Her simple ass had already  hit the jackpot and didn't even know it.co-sign @6:43 the child shouldn't suffer because of his stupidity. He should set up a trust fund, get life and health insurance, pay for private school, tutors, camp, trips to visit him, etc.@E-love outside kids are a switchblade offense in some circles. He better thank God he married the right one.------------------------------------------------planetjacksonworldwide.blogspot.com
 
wait a minute..people i pay 4grand a year for my child to go to a montissori school which teaches french and spanish and its only 500 a month. so if he gives up the extra 500 she still has 2k a month to "take care" of the baby. come on yall we need to get this together.
 
DEAD @ Bee Gee
 
Multi platinum recording artist paying 2G a month.  Wow.  Broke ass - hell naw - Rich broke ass- he is rich but acts broke.  Or his is rich with a broke ass mentality.  Thats the winner.
 
Just an observation.  Women are using children as a meal ticket or is this just the way of the world.  Bitches ain't shit.  Real talk.  At the end of the day, you should have ejaculated down the bathroom sink drain, so some hoe bitch won't drain your pockets.
 
@ 2:05, go eat a dick.  Even if he is worth $$$,$$$.00 wtf that has to do with you or the next bitch.  He made that money, wrote hard, thought hard, its his labor hoe bitch, give a nigger a break.  I wish I would ejaculate into some hoe bitch to come back like the lot of you all do.
 
when you call a woman a bitch, then i see why most you boy ain't to men yet, bitch about being bitches yourselves, now the mother of his children are bitches and this white woman marrying buffoon can send his black son as much as he spends on his mutt son, black men need to grow up and man up, half you won't pay 100 dollars a month, you sound gsy and jealous
 
@ RnBthugDo you know $30k is below poverty? Are you saying that the a millionaire's child should be raised in poverty, while his other children live in a nice house and in a nice neighborhood? Is that what you're suggesting? I ain't saying the child should be living a "million dollar" lifestyle, but his cheap @ss should be able to kick up at least $7k a month for his child, and buy a house in a nice area.
 
ANON@ 234---LIL WAYNE!!!! HANDS DOWN!!!!!
 
AnRnBThug--I NEVER said that it was alright for her to 'go crazy and try to take him to the cleaners'.  I said that with the amount of money that he makes, he can come up with BETTER than $2500.00 a month.  I ALSO said that this baby needs to have all of the other things that his other children have such as SCHOOL, HEALTH INSURANCE and the like; never once did I say that T-Pain had to take care of HER as well.  The fact that she agreed to go to a mediator in the first place, instead of just slam taking T-Pain to court, tells me that she just wants to make sure their son is taken care of.  Broken down and itemized, even 50 pays MORE than some $2500 a month.
 
^^^^School is supposed to be 50/50Health Insurance in supposed be 50/50Anyway I'm 100% sure He already pays healthcare & school What you think She gets that Money and turns around and pays those bills? She wouldn't have a dime. I'm also sure She doesn't have a job and has other kids 50 Pays 5000G's a month...and He's worth WAYYYY More than T-Pain. 50 Was paying 20 a month outta the goodness of His heart and She took Him to court and lost.
 
8:2730k IS NOT BELOW POVERTY! WHAT ARE YOU *&#@%?HERE JUST FOR YOU....SINCE YOU SO INFORMEDhttp://www.atdn.org/access/poverty.html
 
^^^ Are you retarded? Do you know what middle class income is? It is $80 (technically it's really $100k) a year. Anything less than that is POVERTY! Idiot! How in the hell can this chick do "50/50" with a millionaire? Do you realize how retarded you look? This chick is probably only making like $50k a year, if that, and you expect her to kick in 50/50 with a millionaire? Smh, dude keep ya day job! Lol & still smh
 
^^^^ Ha it's clear you don't have any clue...I'm debating with corky here.50/50 Meaning if health insurance is $300 bucks a month She has to kick in $150If Child care is $600 a month She must kick in $300. What does Him being rich have to do with Her having to chip in? Oh wait..that means She gets everything free ? wow so 75k is poverty? Hahaha...I live in NYC, this is the most expensive city in all the U.S. 75k is NOT poverty here. It is if you a dumbass and spending your Money like you expect to get a free check every week. Then if I take that Money to a city like Atlanta I'd live like a King....Listen, be quite expressing your thoughts & opinions is not becoming of you
 
2000 beans a month ain't shit. my rent is 1500 a month. he makes tons of dough. i don't care how many jobs mom has he needs to pay more. these men are paying small amounts of child support while the mother is spending her whole salary to keep the child taken care of.the custodial parents ALWAYS SPENDS WAY MORE MONEY THAN THE ABSENTEE PARENT..  i know i went through it. this is why i told my daughters don't be stupid. these men only lose a little money but the mother or custodial parent loses lots of money plus their life.. i hope she does get more nobody told him to cheat on his wife. he should pay the piper. the child is innocent and deserves to be well provided for because daddy can afford it..this baby is no different than his other kids. they all came from his dick..
 
^^^^ sounds to me like Mommy made all the wrong decisions and is stuck with a boat load of kids, no man and little money & is very bitter as a result..poor thang
 
its beyond me while we even debate child support. if you make a baby and abandone him or her you should pay child support point blank and simple. being as thaT There are way more single mothers than single fathers, the father should pay a nice amount. why should the father have to only pay pennies when mom is giving her all. why should he pay 2000 while mom is paying more for rent, bills, clothen, or a car note, or mortgage, food, gas, school, medical, dental, all that shit is a hell of alot more than 2000 dollars a month. its going to be more the older he gets.. and it does not matter if she has 65 jobs homie still has to pay up. other countries don't have chid support we should be glad we live in a country that does.if she was on welfare some of you would be taking shit about that. damn a woman can't win for losing. if she goes on welfare she's lazy or a golddigger or if she asks dad for child support she is still lazy and a golddigger. make up your mind people. crazy.. so in laymen's terms if  a lady asks a man to be responsible she is a golddigger??? wow what a fucked world we live in... now i see why there are so many deadbeat dads. we co-sign that shit..
 
check it out fake rnb thug. i don't have a boat load of kids. yeah i bet you are surprised. ha, ha.  my kids are grown. i bet you didn't expect that either.. i don't have grandkids.. ha. my kids were very well provided for honey. if you make a baby you should pay child support. i stepped up to the plate G... guess what i am still owed child support and when i do receive a little money here and there i keep it. yeah, baby i don't have to spend it on my grown kids because thats my money .thats the law. its money i already spent. yeah sweetie i enjoy spending my ex's money on what i want. this is a word to the wise pay your child support when the child is a child because if you don't the custodial parent will enjoy spending your money when the kids are grown. thats the best revenge..
 
@ RnBthugOkay, let's use your retarded logic for a moment. This dude made $15 million last year, which is a little over a mill a month. Let's say the chick makes $1400 a month. Are you saying that the father should only be responsible for maybe $400 a week, because that's all the mother could afford go 50/50, for their child? I mean..are you serious? I just cannot believe the lengths of idiocy that men will go thru to justify why a woman should not be entitled to a certain amount of child support..smh
 
^^^^ Why do you think You should be granted the "world" cause You opened your legs to a Married Man? This is what I'm saying. As long as the Kids have a roof over their heads, food in the fridge for them, and adequate schooling..that's it. It don't matter how much He is making. Cause He in a Mansion you should be too???  That's NOT HIS WIFE. He does not have to provide Financial security for HER, only for His wife.A jump off Does not get the same privileges as a Wife. Why you think 50 Kids' Mom get 5k a month? And to the Dummy that said 2k aint nothing but their rent is 1500.00, so if somebody was knocking out that rent for you it would help you a lot? (yeahhhoookk) Wow so you have grown kids? Congrats AI hope you taught them Men aint shit and to go for the Money!!!If you did, you a great job....spend that money up Girl!! (cluck, cluck) yeah...you getting sweet revenge...(chirp, chirp)
 
^^^ So are you saying the man shouldn't be punished financially for committing adultery and creating an out of wedlock bastard? Look, nobody is suggesting that this chick be living it up in a mansion, the issue is the amount of money that this woman should be entitled to for a life that they BOTH created. A child needs a roof, mortgage/light/gas/food/toys etc., clothes/education/healthcare/insurance/other curriculm activities. There is no way in hell $2k is gonna cover all those expenses. And if the chick is living in a f*cked up neighborhood, T-Pain should be buying her a new house, as well as a car/vehicle to take their child to and from school etc., it is expensive to raise a child, especially if the mother doesn't have the funds to do so.
 
^^^^Hoodrat chatter..."go girl get that $$$"

GREEDY ASS BITCH + STUPID-ASS-MOTHERFUCKA WHO CAN'T KEEP HIS DICK'S WRAPPED THE FUCK UP= 2 DUMB ASSES TRYING TO RAISE A CHILD!!
 
i was pregnant by t-pain also,but unlike ms.cherry i have goals to accomplish so im pretty sure u all know what i had to do..im not proud of my decision but it was a long term decision to make..i thought about my future first..ive never been a gold digger and i was just in love as well as his wife butt i knew what it was when i got with him..i knew he was married,so when a baby accidentally pops up i knew that it was the end of t-pain and i..im just sorry  i ever met him.i wish i never met him.it was fun while it lasted..i knew we werent goingg to have a future together..i knew it had to end somewhere..just not like it  did..
 
i also didnt wanna deal with the whole child support drama,on top of that i already have a daughter to raise..i knew what i was in for if i wouldve had his baby..its hard with just one,and talking about having another one,i wasnt ready and still isnt.im in school tryna make something of myself..so if i wouldve had his baby for money purposes that wouldve been out of my character..id rather work for mine than to be waiting on a check every month..then i wouldve cared more about him being in my childs life than hhim sending money every month..thats what matters most to me..i know  his wife wouldnt have had that though..i just prayed on the situation and did what i had to do.im in nursing school and i wasnt about to give that up just to have Faheems baby or for anyone.i wanna get rich on my own,not by having a rich guys baby.Faheem is his real name..and no,he doesnt believe in using condoms.i may write a book on t-pain and i relationship and what it was like being number two to a celebrity,it might just sell out...OUT!!

For Women Who Want The Ballerific Life!    Athlete: Michael Jordan Position: One of the greatest basketball players of all time
Drama: Mama has great divorce lawyers
Dish: After 17 years of marriage that included expensive gifts, three children, and failed attempts of reconciliation, Michael and Juanita Jordan divorced in '07. Michael is said to be paying his ex-wife $168 million, which includes the former couple's 7-acre Highland Park estate. Cha-ching! Forget about wanting to "be like Mike," we want to be like Juanita: filthy rich, thanks to the legal system.
  Athlete:Travis Henry Position: Denver Broncos running back
Drama: Too many mamas, not enough dollas
The Dish: Travis Henry probably couldn't explain to you how a condom works seeing how he has nine children ... with nine different women ... in at least four southern states. Henry has a $25 million contract and a base monthly salary near $50,000, but splurging $100,000 on a car and $146,000 on jewelry leaves very little for those pesky child support payments. The NFL player fell so far behind on payments, a judge ordered Henry to establish a $250,000 trust fund to cover a new $3000/month child support payment for a boy he fathered with Jameshia Beacham. Young, unprotected sex surely can burn a whole in your pocket
  Athlete: Gilbert Arenas Position: Washington Wizards guard
Drama: Crazy, but apparently loveable
The Dish: Gilbert Arenas is a weird guy. It's actually a quality that makes him pretty funny and a fan favorite, but in some regards, weird does have its limits. In 2006, Arenas' on-and-off again girlfriend, Laura Govan, chased him all over our great country with the intent to embarrass and serve him a paternity suit during a televised game. He spent a chunk of the season hiding in hotel rooms under various aliases. Weird? Not really. Cat-and-mouse games come with the territory of being a highly paid athlete struggling with the concept of a condom. But after all that drama the two reconciled, Arenas bought her a house near his in Northern Virginia and in March of '07 she gave birth to his second child. Procreating again with the woman who set out to destroy you ... that's not just a little weird, it's a touch of baby mama Stockholm syndrome.
  Athlete: Tom Brady Position: New England Patriots quarterback
Drama: Baby mama crimping his style
The Dish: Two months after dumping actress Bridget Moynahan and upgrading to supermodel Giselle Bundchen, the actress dropped a bomb on the QB: she was pregnant with his son. This of course unleashed all kinds of drama, mainly of the single-struggling-mother-vs.- baby's-father-galavanting-with-hot-new-girlfriend-seems-like-he-could-care-less-about-the-kid variety. While Brady's been leading the NFL's hottest team on the field and creeping with Giselle off it, Bridget's been raising their child in California . She even provided the child, John Edward Thomas, with her last name -- not Brady's -- on the birth certificate. Funny how the New York Jets are the Patriots chief rivals and Tom Brady's son's initials spell JET. Coincidence or revenge of a scorned baby mama?
  Athlete: Shaquille O'Neal Position: Miami Heat center
Drama: Shady business
The Dish: After five years of marriage and four children, Shaq filed for divorce in September with allegations that his wife Shaunie O'Neal had been "secretive" about her money and that she may have used marital funds without telling him. The rumor mill churned with gossip that the baller's wife bought a home for her former boyfriend, although recent court reports show no indication of that. According to a financial affidavit she filed, Shaunie's worth nearly $30 million -- and that's before her divorce cut from Shaq.
  Athlete: Jason Kidd Position: New Jersey Nets point guard
Drama: CRAZY
The Dish: Jason Kidd, who five years ago plead guilty to hitting his wife, Joumana, over a french fry, went through some difficulties this year. And by difficulties, we're talking about the ugly public divorce kind, which includes allegations of infidelity and domestic abuse. After essentially calling his wife a psycho who physically abused him in a lawsuit, Joumana filed a counter-suit against her hubby with claims he had extramarital affairs with TV reporters, strippers, a cheerleader, a Nets season ticket holder and ... basically anything breathing in a skirt. She also claimed Kidd assaulted her with everything from a rock to a cookie. But according to Joumana, that's all in the past now. "He comes over all the time -- we laugh and joke about it now and he's apologized a million times about how it happened," she told the NY Post. How exactly do those conversations transpire? Perhaps something like, "Hey Jason, remember when you almost killed me and threw cookies at my head? Ah, good times. So funny. Hahahahaha .. so hilarious."
  Athlete: Matt Leinart Position: Arizona Cardinals quarterback
Drama: Mama's a party killer
The Dish: Arizona Cardinals quarterback Matt Leinart has been linked with Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan and even Britney Spears. Ladies love him, guys want to be him and USC women's basketball player Brynn Cameron has the golden ticket: she's the mother of his kid. After publicly venting about the struggles of carrying most of the parenting load while her baby daddy lived a playboy lifestyle, followed by a less-than-comfy child support dispute, Cameron now has $15,000 reasons to be happy each month. That's the amount Leinart shells out in child support for baby Cole.
  Player: Larry Fitzgerald Position: Arizona Cardinals wide receiver
Drama: He could be the father
The Dish: Matt Leinart isn't the only Cardinals player with baby mama drama, wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald might as well be a guest on a Maury Povich "Who's the Daddy?" show. Angela Nazario, a former Oakland Raiderettes cheerleader, filed suit and is currently seeking child support from Fitzgerald who she says is the father of her unborn child. And how's this for drama: Fitzgerald apparently asked Nazario to have an abortion, and then tried to bribe her with money, cars and houses when she refused to comply. "I don't need this all over the news like Matt Leinart," he allegedly said. Oops ... too late. Fitzgerald has asked for a DNA paternity test to be taken once the child is born in January.

What will Maury say? "Larry, you are ..." stay tuned.
  Athlete: LeBron James Position: Cleveland Cavaliers forward
Drama: Permanent baby mama
The Dish: When it comes to LeBron James and his longtime girlfriend, Savannah Brinson, there appears to be little drama. He's an NBA superstar/cash cow, fans love him, and the two welcomed their second son, Bryce Maximus James, into the world this year. No drama at all ... until you consider the fact Savannah is still waiting on that wedding bling from King James. Two kids ... with the same woman ... and no proposal? Perhaps it's a grand plan to make sure she doesn't get alimony one day.
  Athlete: Kobe Bryant
Position: Los Angeles Lakers shooting guard
Drama: It's cheaper to keep her
The Dish: After meeting at a music video shoot where Vanessa was a background dancer, Kobe handed her a seven-carat engagement ring, v alued at $100,000 while she was still in high school. Vanessa's given birth to his two daughters, stood by him when he fessed up to cheating and was accused of rape, and amazingly accepted his apology (and the $4 million diamond ring that came with it).
 Don't hold your breath waiting for a Vanessa-Kobe divorce because Mrs. Bryant isn't going anywhere. She's a 25 year-old with two kids and since the Bryants had no prenuptial agreement, she stands to receive half of his $200 million. If Kobe likes his fat wallet, he'll hold on real tight to V. Now we're not saying she's a gold digger, but she's certainly working with some high figures.  Athlete: Elijah Dukes Position: Washington Nationals outfielder
Drama: Anger management issues
The Dish: Elijah Dukes' estranged wife, NiShea Gilbert sought a restraining order against him after he repeatedly threatened her and their two children in phone calls and text messages, including a photo of a handgun he sent to her cell phone. In April, Dukes stormed the school where she teaches and threatened her to the point where a sheriff's deputy had to ban him from the property. And if you're looking for more drama: he's the father of five children by four different women and two of his kids were born eight days apart from each other. With the writer's strike looming, the 'Dukes of Sperm' is sure to be a reality TV hit
  Athlete: Jason Caffey Position: Former NBA player
Drama: So many kids, so little cash
The Dish: Jason Caffey hasn't received an NBA check since 2003, which is unfortunate for him because he has some big child support payments to make for at least eight children ranging from ages 3-14, in and around Atlanta as well as in Alabama, Louisiana and Illinois. It's actually not clear exactly how many children Caffey has fathered, as he and his attorney are mum on the actual count. The former NBA player was so behind on his payments he had to file for bankruptcy to keep his baby mamas at bay.

Or that sheâs taking care of this trifling, free-loading broad. Weâre gonna take the positive approach and applaud Granny Katherine for looking out for her grandbabiesâ best interest. TMZ reports Ms. Jackson is using some house work to finally get skanky-azz Alejandra Oaziaza â mother of two sons and a daughter by Randy Jackson, as well as two of Jermaineâs sons â out of the family compound. TMZ has learned â¦ everyone is moving out of the Jackson family compound in Encino while the house undergoes extensive renovations â¦ and when the dust settles, another Jackson 5 will be personae non gratae. Weâve learned Katherine Jackson and company are in the process of packing boxes and will leave the family home in early December for several months during the remodel.   But thereâs a bigger story here.  As TMZ first reported, after the infamous âstun gunâ incident at the home â in March, when Jaafar allegedly threatened to shock Blanket â Katherine asked Jaafarâs mother, Alejandra, to take her 5 kids and move. As we told you, Katherine and the Michael Jackson Estate generously offered Alejandra and her brood a condo MJ owned in the San Fernando Valley, but Alejandra wanted a lot more â thus the stand off. Now weâre told Katherine is not letting Alejandra back in the house after the remodel.  The condo offer still stands, but if she doesnât accept sheâll have to find somewhere else to live with Jaafar, Jermajesty, Dante and Randy, Jr. But one of Alejandraâs kids is getting a reprieve from Katherine.  Weâre told 20-year-old Genevieve will be staying with Katherine and Michaelâs kids in a temporary home during the remodel, and she will be the lone child of Alejandra who will be welcomed back to Hayvenhurst. Wait. We know Jermaine claims heâs too broke. But explain to us again why RANDY isnât taking care of his three kids??? Jermajesty?!
REALLY?!
smh :-( I swearâ¦that name is almost as dumb as Jermaines hair. This is one trashy baby mama. that was Oprahâs exact response when she meet him. lol Katherineâs heart is entirely to bigâ¦  I love this , So doesâ My boyfriend. I met him via âAffluentSingle ââMâ a nice place for seeking _Rich romance and love, which gives you a chance to make your life better and open opportunities for you to meet the attractive sin gles and treat you like a king or Queen. Maybe you wanna check it out or tell your friends. @@@ ;) ;)  Hope you will find your true love there since thousands of singles have successed thereâ¦ Itâs about time she kind that hoe out of her house. That trick needs to get a damn job and rental and take care of her 5 kids..what Ms.Jackson got to do with that. And Randy and Jermaine need to take care of they damn kids..she bout to get hers that skank Jermajesty has to be one of the top 10 Ultimate Ghetto Baby Names. This whole family is a bunch of loons.Sorry but truth is truth,how the h3ll does a woman have babies with 2 brothers??So that means the kids are siblings and cousins..therapists make alot of money with that family.. I think the bigger question is how does two brothers have kids by the same woman??? And Im suppose to believe this because it was on TMZ? The 411 been out there for a minute about this situation w/ them 2 bros. b4 TMZ was in existence. This family is faqed! Look at Jermaineâs California Raisin looking azz with a side of MR. Potato head LMBAO BWAHAHAHAHAAAAA! ;-) LAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWLLLLLL OMG!!!!!!!! LOLOLOLOLOL. That is hilarious!!!!! Itâs the truth but wow, Jermaineâs gotta knows he looks unreal! HAâ¦HILARITYâ¦ FOR REALS SHE SHOULD BE LIKE THE GOLD DIGGING JUMP OFF QUEEN LOL HOW TO YOU GET 3 GOLDEN TICKETS FROM THAT FAM â¦LOL . Randy doesnât have 3 kids.  What from that story made you think the daugher we never heard of was his?  All it means is that ho got 3 baby dadies.  At least she is well behaved enough to be allowed to stay.  I think Katherine should kick her azz out too. OOOh! So the daughter got a diff. baby daddy? Dannnnnng!!
How did the fam put up w/ that mess? Being Jehovah and all. Huh. Wow, this is one crazy baby mama, kids w/two brothers. Just gross yuck. No respect for oneself, periodâ¦ I AGREEâ¦ that broad is truly a skank with no morals at all!

 Inquests Police Meningitis Police CCTV Arsenal FC Chelsea FC AFC Bournemouth Manchester United FC Zlatan Ibrahimovic THE mother of Cristiano Â­Ronaldoâs baby is a Â­penniless American waitress who the football star seduced with the line: âMe, you, f*** f***.â But his chat-up line was so blunt, she didnât understand it. So Ronaldo Â­resorted to drawing a love heart on a misted-up window and said: âMe, you, kiss!â Then he whisked her back to his hotel for a one-night stand which left the girl pregnant â and Ronaldo with a Â£10million paternity bill. Most of the world believed that Â­Ronaldo had actually used a surrogate mother to have his baby â but the Sunday Mirror can reveal the truth of his sudden Â­unexpected fatherhood. And how, after hearing the baby was his, he told friends âI feel like Boris Beckerâ â a reference to the tennis star who fathered a love-child after having sex just once in a London restaurant â which cost him Â£20m.

 The Â£200,000-a-week striker used his best friend to help broker an exclusive Â­paternity deal in New York, supervised by his fearsome mother Dolores Aveiro, to bring the baby back to Portugal. Ronaldo has told friends he wonât tell the boy the identity of his mother until his 18th birthday. Football fans reacted with disbelief when Ronaldo, whose conquests include socialite Paris Hilton and reality TV star Imogen Thomas, suddenly Â­announced on July 3 that he had a son. In a cryptic message posted on Facebook, he told how the babyâs Â­mother wanted to remain private and Â­declared: âMy son will be under my exclusive guardianship.â He later said the baby had been named Cristiano after him. And the little boyâs mother has been paid a life-changing $15.1million to keep her identity Â­confidential and to hand the child over to Ronaldoâs Â­family. Last summer, on a trip to Los Â­Angeles that would see him hooking up with Paris Hilton, Â­Ronaldo Â­strutted into a restaurant and spotted the future mother of his son. A friend said: âRonni looked the girl in the eye and said extremely directly: âMe, you, f*** f***.â âShe was taken aback and just said: âWhat!â She didnât actually understand what he meant. She was totally nonplussed âThe window by his table was steamed up, so he drew a love heart on it with his finger. Then he said, âMe, you, kiss,â and the penny dropped. âThatâs typical Ronni â he pretends his English is terrible when it suits him, and he comes straight to the point. It was just yet another one-night stand and Ronnie assumed he would never see her again.â But after finding out she was pregnant, and convinced Ronaldo was the only possible father, the woman tracked him down through his agent, Jorge Mendes. Mendes told Ronaldo, who immediately told his no-nonsense mother Dolores, 55, and sisters Elma, 34, and 33-year-old Liliana CÃ¡tia. It was agreed that Ronaldo would give DNA for a paternity test once the baby was born and provide support for the mother and child if it proved to be his.The friend revealed: âCristiano was told the result while he was away at the World Cup.â And then Dolores stepped in. The friend said: âRonni is a multi-millionaire playboy, but when it comes to family, heâs very much his motherâs son. âThey are a close-knit, traditional Â­Roman Catholic family and the minute paternity was established there was absolutely no doubt that Ronni would be doing the right thing. âThere was simply no question of him walking away. Even if he had wanted to, Dolores just would not have entertained it for one moment. âThis is her grandchild and there was only one option for the childâs upbringing â with her and her daughters in Portugal. The childâs mother would be properly provided for to enable her to live a life in keeping with the upbringing the child will have. âRonni has not decided whether to involve the mother in his sonâs life. He thinks he might tell him who she is. âDoloresâs view is that if the child eventually decides to make contact with the mother, it is important she is living an affluent lifestyle. âIt would offend Dolores for the child to find his mother living in poverty. âItâs a huge amount of money, but Ronni insists itâs not a big deal because heâs worth Â£100million and heâs got the best part of his career ahead of him still.â Despite being voted FIFA Player of the Year in 2009 and moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United for a record-breaking Â£80million last year, Ronaldo had a poor World Cup in South Â­Africa. Tipped to be one of the mega-stars of the tournament, he scored just once in five games, prompting speculation about his indifferent form. But his friend insisted: âRonni said was pleased to become a father, even though he hadnât planned to have the child. He hasnât even told his closest friends who the mother is. I had guessed she was a Bunny Girl from Vegas, but she isnât a well-known party girl or socialite. She had hardly a dime to her name until she was paid by Ronni.â Meanwhile Â­Ronaldo has shown no sign of curbing his womanising. A source said: âThis week he has on Â­Facebook contacting women who will talk dirty. âHe is Â­determined to be the best father he can â but he doesnât equate that with having to settle down.â This week the public got a glimpse of the child when the baby was rushed to hospital after suffering a mystery illness at home in the Algarve.  adrian.butler@sundaymirror.co.uk   Free Daily Email

Comments (7) Badge nomination  Related Photo Clubs Related Groups Please sign in Get Help Membership & Newsletters BabyCenter Shortcuts BabyCenter Mobile Our U.S. Sites Our International Sites Kind of a long post...and sorry if it seems a little choppy. My boyfriend and I have been together for a good minute, and he already has a son. I'm currently 6 months pregnant. Before I was pregnant, I helped take care of my boyfriend's son when he was at work or had to do something. His son and his mother live in another state, so although he gets to see his son maybe once a month, it's only for a short period of time that he can actually keep him. When he told his son's mom about having another child on the way, she got really upset about it. They had her son a birthday party in May, and she told him that he better not bring his other baby mama. Sure, I felt some type of way because I love her son like he was my own, and I helped take care of him when he was here BUT I let it go and even paid for a photographer for the party even though I wouldn't be there (because ultimately it's about his son, not me or her). Her not wanting me there threw me off a little afterward because she sent a Mother's Day card to me through my boyfriend (the party was the day before Mother's Day). Kind of confused me... We don't know each other. Never spoke before. But we have seen each other once, which was a very unfortunate situation. She came from out of state to pick up her son on Father's Day from my boyfriend. She just walked in the church, sat for a few moments, and left. My dilemma is this...I want my son to know his brother. I wouldn't mind letting my boyfriend take him to go see his big brother some times, but I do want to know who he will be around when he goes. I would really like to get to know her, but I don't know if it's too soon or what. I have really thought about trying to contact her, but I don't want her first reaction to be that she thinks I'm trying to be messy or trying to start drama so automatically shut my efforts to get to know her down. Would you go ahead and make that effort or just leave it alone until she comes to me? Or how would you deal with this situation? your efforts are genuine, and if SHE is not off on some messy BS, she will see and respect that.Â  If she doesn't, it's her problem.Â  Sonja, Team Pink Mommy X 2!! Â Layla & AntoniaÂ 8/19/10  "Children are not poons in the game of life" - Somebody's Moooooo I THINK YOUR being very mature about it! lol! i told my sons father that the only ways my son withh know his borther and sister is if he ships them to me for a few weeks! lol! cause ill be damned if im sending my zaky out there! lmao! football_lady, girl I know how you feel,lol...that's why I want to know who my baby is going to be around first because otherwise they will just have to see each other when he comes to visit his dad. you are very mature... and sound so sincere... my BF also has another daughter... she's 6... I never met her mom... we don't talk... if I answer the phone we will ...but other than that... no conversation...but their daughter comes over to spend time with her dad... now that we have our babygirl... their daughter is so excited to meet her...I'm not sure how her mom feels... my babygirl will not be going to her sister's house... she has no reason to... I don't know the other baby moma... so I will not let my daughter go somewhere where I don't know the people... I would have to meet her first... I think my BF's baby moma should have demanded to meet me years ago...I'm not going to break my neck trying to start a relationship with the baby moma... we have to be cordial for the kids sake... but we don't have to be on facebook sharing photos... LOL... I would ask your BF what he thinks about it... sometimes women will take what you meant as a good gesture and turn it into something messy and you had nothing but good intentions... good luck to you...let me know how it turns out... but don't stress over it... take care of you and your baby  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  mommy to Siedah Denyice 6/29/10 ~Roberta~ I think you are being very mature about the whole situation...my hubby has a son who is 6 and although I have met the baby mama we do not talk....if she calls and I answer its very give hubby the phone...I agree withÂ  Roberta...she should have demanded to meet me and get to know me years ago...especially since I was around her son all the time...anyhow she didn't and now she feels awkward around me.... I do not think your child should go to her house to visit with his other sibling...my LO only sees my hubby's son when he comes to visit us....that's just how it goes when you are in a blended family type situation.... Don't stress on her...she sounds like she still needs to grow up I think that your BF has the onus of establishing how everything should go down, after all HE is the reason that all this has come about.Â  I think that your apprehensions are normal, but you don't know how real they are until you've talked to your BF.Â  If HE doesn't know how she feels about the whole situation, he needs to find out.Â  I wouldn't send my child with him if he's not able to assure you of your child's safety and being free from any negative drama... I'm in a similar situation myself...DH has a 6 year old daughter...I've been with him for 4 years...Though he and his baby mama were never a couple, they were always cordial and cool with each other.Â  His girl friend before me that he dated for 2 years she didn't have issues with, etc.Â  I have never met her because by the time it was time for me to meet his daughter (after an agreed 6 months of dating) he proposed...When he told baby mama that he was getting married, she flipped out went to court accused him of raping her, having guns, selling drugs, etc...She went to try to get his parental rights revoked...It didn't work (she acted a nut...they had to threaten to actually have her physically removed she acted such a fool), but it has made for some seriously strained relations...She went from calling him 24/7 and him seeing his daughter anytime along with his court appointed time to communications being through text messages and him having their pick ups and drop offs at the police station because she's tried to fight him and has acted a fool in public...Sooo THIS is the extreme, and I'm not sure if your situation is remotely THIS crazy, but DH has managed EVERYTHING as it pertains to his daughter and her mother...He has told her that until she gets some serious "act right" she wont be able to meet me...Period...We've been together for 4 years, and she STILL hasn't met me, and we live in the same city...DH isn't playing, and I support him... So I said all that to say get your BF involved.Â  He should be managing this.Â  It shouldn't be as stressful to you as it is...HE should be taking a leadership role in the relations between his children's mothers... Shiloh Xavier born 11/9/2009 at 9:07p.m Judah Elyse born 5/4/2013 at 2:02p.m Thank you ladies! I agree with all of you. Mom2Shiloh, girl that's REAL extreme,lol. She has showed herself a few times, but it was nothing to take serious...all of her threats are idle. But I will definitely have to bring it up to him and see how things go from there.

 MAMA GURU MAMARAZZI CUTIE ALERT  Urbandictionary.com defines the term Baby Mama to mean: âThe mother of your child(ren), whom you did not marry and with whom you are not currently involved.â In 2008, when a major news organization used the term âBaby Mamaâ to describe First Lady Michelle Obama, many people took offense, and rightly so. Afterall, the first lady is a married woman. A writer for Essence.com recently wrote an article in salute to all âbaby mommasâ. Writer Steven James Dixon, who is a married man, says that he wrote his salute âon behalf of all men who know that they could have given extra effort during pregnancy with their wife or woman. I wrote this on behalf of all men who were not as sensitive during the pregnancy as they could have been. So, men, we may need to apologize and we definitely need to appreciate our baby mommas! Motherâs Day is about celebrating them. They deserve to be celebrated every year. Plan accordingly for Motherâs Day.â Click here to read Jamesâ article in its entirety. Given Stevenâs positive spin on the term, do you think the wordsÂ  Baby Mama(Daddy) demeaning?

I can only imagine what it is going to be like when Cromartie retires from pro football and he does not have the money to pay child support for all those kids. I think that these women thought that by hooking up with him they would be living the good life, but unfortunately, it does not happen that way. He needs to grow up and be a father to his kids. What he really needs is a mentor to help him to be the father that he never had. I agree.

	Baby Mama Drama       So you meet the guy. He's tall, handsome, has an amazing personality, beautiful smile and overall just an all-around nice guy. You go out on a few dates and really get to know each better, then somewhere in the conversation he finds the courage to tell you he has a beautiful baby girl or boy. However, the downside to that is he has an insanely crazy baby mama! What do you do? Do you run straight for the hills or do you sit down and weigh out the proâs and conâs of the situation? The fact of the matter is, we live in a time where more and more children are being brought into this world out of wedlock, leaving the mother and/or father to carry along excess baggage into a relationship. Not saying this is a bad thing, but how many of us truly want to enter a relationship knowing at one time or another we will have to deal with our partnerâs ex on a consistent basisâand usually not on good terms?  Don't get me wrong; there are many exâs that can end their relationships and still be amicable with one another when it comes to raising their child. However, what do you do when your partnerâs ex refuses to let go of the past and becomes a strain on your current relationship? Playing devilâs advocate for the baby mama, I can see how hurt she could be seeing her ex move on with his life and she not being able to do the same for various reasons. Maybe sheâs regretting decisions that she made on her end; maybe she feels he will begin to shun away from his child, or maybe sheâs scared of the idea of being alone in general. Nevertheless, many women that find themselves in this position somehow convince themselves that by having these notions they are given permissible grounds to present their old flames with pure hell in their future relationshipsâultimately affecting you, the new lady in their life.Â  While streaming the internet, I found numerous sites, support groups and blogs dedicated to helping new significant others deal with their partnerâs baby mama drama. Thereâs babymamadrama.com, weuse2beu.com and even a how-to guide on wikihow.com - a spin off of the popular wikipedia.com. These sites include women from across the country reaching out to one another giving support, advice and a listening ear, testifying to the daily struggles that come with dating a man with children.  In the end, they all end their conversations with the hard question that many women have to ask themselves during their relationship. Is he truly worth the baby mama drama? Letâs look at the proâs and conâs of the situation: The Conâs:  * Dealing with the eye rolls and catty comments being said in his exâs camp. * The possibilities that she will have their child be disrespectful towards you whenever you are around. * Knowing that sometimes you will not be the number one priority in the relationship. * And unfortunately, sometimes having to calm yourself down when you know your partnerâs ex is maliciously and spitefully finding ways to sabotage the wonderful relationship you and your partner possess.  The Proâs: *Appreciating the genuine relationship your partner has with his child. Nine times out of ten, it will reflect the relationship he will have with your children should your relationship move to that level.  * Seeing how hard he is trying to keep all parties involved happy and content.  * Realizing that aside for this one obstacle, everything else in your relationship is seemly great. * And finally, understanding that we all have special circumstances when entering a relationship. Should you chose to stay it proves you are willing to accept him for who he is and what heâs bringing to the table. That includes, taking the good with the bad and working towards a loving and productive future with one another.Â   Â  When all else fails remember the five tips wikihow.com reminds every new partner to take into consideration when dealing with the baby mama drama: 1. Remember, the mother is a woman, a person, with emotions just like you. Although this is one tip we all try to forget, remember the golden rule! Treat others the way you want to beÂ Â  treated, regardless of how they may treat you.  2. Realize, the mother (probably) is NOT going anywhere. Again another hard pill to swallow, but a reality nonetheless. If you are in your relationship for the long haul, you have to realize she is now apart of your life in one shape or another. Find a constructive way to deal with her.  3. If at all possible, try and talk to the baby mama. Even though this idea can seem far-fetched, sometimes having a sit down conversation with the mother can help clear the air and show that you are trying to be respectful to her and their child. Reassuring her that you are not trying to take her place, but rather thinking of the childâs best interest. Additionally, showing that by giving her this type of respect you are expecting the same in return.  4. When everything else fails - let your man BE a man. Remember at the end of the day, your man has to deal with the mother as a means of raising their child together. Imagine how hard it is for him trying to keep the peace amongst everyone involved in the situation. Sometimes we have to let a man BE a man in order to show we have faith in him and in his decision-making skills.  5. Lastly, assert how you feel. Communication is key! Let your partner know how you feel. Your feelings are just as valid as his. By keeping an open and honest relationship, you are better able to assess obstacles together, stand firm when troubles seem to be lurking around the corner, and most importantly, work together as a team when such baby mama drama may occur.  In closing, ladies, remember we are too fabulous and divinely favored to let such drama take over our lives. When dating a man with children, take a good look at the entire picture. Is he truly worth the possible baby mama drama or are you ready to put in work to make sure your relationship is a prosperous union between the two of you? Yes, the decision is all yours, but it is a decision that shouldnât be taking lightlyâ¦.  Until next time stay blessed, beautiful and fabulous! Â  Don't forget to  visit the Glossy Blog!

 Â RSS - Posts Every day in America 4,184 babies are born to unmarried mothers (State of Americaâs Children 2008 Report). With this stat we know that the odds of a woman dating or marrying a man with a child(ren) is high. Having a partner with children can be very challenging for many reasons but todayâs topic is baby mama drama. If your partnerâs babyâs mama is mature, understanding, a good parent or if she has a relationship with the Lord, thatâs awesome and youÂ should consider yourselfÂ blessed!! If sheâs jealous, neglectful, angry, aggressive, rude and immature, you are in for a challenge BUT nothing is too big for God. If youÂ are in a committed relationship or married to someone who has a child with someone else, there are things that youÂ canÂ do to help the relationship with the childâs mother go smoothly. Below are tips on how to avoid baby mama drama. I pray the tips are helpful to you.Â  To the ladies that are babyâs mamaâs, please know that Iâm not saying all BMâs are mean and rude. Iâm trying to help those that are facing challenges in this area to make their situation better. Please hear my heart and know that I have love and respect for any woman working hard to raise her child. 10 tips on how to get along with your manâs baby mama. 1. Pray for the mother.Â We allÂ know that it isÂ difficult to be a single parent, even when the father is involved from outside of the home.Â We also can admit that no one wants to be the babyâs mother while another womanÂ gets to be theÂ girlfriend or the wife. PrayÂ and ask God to give her strength, wisdom, peace, joy, patience and the resourcesÂ needed to raise her children.Â See her as a soul that needs to be won to Christ if she is not saved. We win people to Christ by our love walk and example shown in front of them. So no matter what happens, donât curse her out and get ignorant with her, that will ruin your witness. 2. Confess good things over her, the baby, as well as youÂ andÂ your spousesâ relationship with her. Confess that she is a good mother, she is patient and kind, she has the fruits of the spirit. Donât call herÂ âthe crazy or evil babyâs mama.âÂ Donât say, âmeÂ and my husband are gonna kill each otherÂ if heÂ donât do something about that woman.âÂ Speak those things that be not as though they were. Call the mother blessed, kind, peaceful, mature etc. Confess peace andÂ blessing no matter what it looks like.Â  3. Believe that God answers prayer and it will get better. If we ask in prayer, anything in Jesusâ name, we must believe that he answers prayer. Since youâre praying that the relationship between your partner and the mother gets better, you must believe that God hears you and things are changing in your situation. Whatever you need to see changed, believe that when you pray, God hears you and is working it out. If you believe, you canât confess negativity, remember that. 4. Donât compete with the mother. Know your role and be confident in your partnerâs love and commitment to you. She is the mother, she deserves respect, but she is not the woman who holds his heart. Donât let the pressure of the mother being his ex or the childâs mom rock you from being confident in your relationship. Be secure and donât let her rock your boat! No man wants an insecure woman Donât compete or compare yourself to her. Be you, do you, and let her be her. 5. Remember itâs all about the children. Sometimes in situations like these, the adults lose focus on whatâs the most important, CHILDREN!! The children need love, proper raising, structure, discipline, teaching etc. Who really cares if the parents arenât best of buds! As long as everyone is respectful and doesnât speak ill of each other in the presence of the children, nothing else really matters. If you donât get along with the childrenâs mother, do more praying than talking. Let God handle it and you let your light shine and keep your mouth closed!! 6. Walk in love and have patience. The bible tells us to love our enemies as ourselves. Iâm not saying your partnerâs babyâs mother is your enemy but sometimes it may feel that way! In those situations, showing her love and patience will make difficult situations easier. No one can cause drama and argue on their own. If the mother likes to push you and your partnerâs buttons, lying, trying to start arguments or wonât let you see the children, stay in love and walk in patience. Consider getting a mediator or someone to help you work through the rough patches if necessary. Also, encourage him to pray about taking her to court so visitation and child support can be established and in writing. 7. Ignore the little things. This tip is simple, everything doesnât deserve a response! If the mother makes little rude or jealous comments or the children repeat to you what sheâs said, you donât always have to confront her or even repeat it. Foolishness is foolishness and why feed into it. Pray a simple prayer for her and keep moving. You can win her to Christ by your lifestyle and love walk! 8. Look for ways that you and your partner can be a blessing to her and the child. If the motherâs car is down, encourage your partner to help transport the child where he/she needs to go. If she lost her job encourage your partner to drop a few groceries by for a while until they get on their feet again. Remember the children are both of your responsibility if you two are married, and you two want the children to have all that they need, despite how the mother behaves at times. He will be blessed for doing more than child support requires of him if thereâs an important need. 9. Work with your husband to establish clear boundaries for the mother. By boundaries I mean not allowing her to call him at all hours of the night unless itâs a true emergency. Not allowing her to just drop by unannounced whenever she wants just to hangout. Encourage your husband to set boundaries with her so everyoneâs roles and expectations are clear. 10. Be a team with your partner and make sure you two communicate. Make sure you support your partner in prayer, with your time by caring for and loving on his child appropriately and with a good attitude. Itâs your job to be a team player! Also if you have contact with the mother, make sure she knows that you love her child and want to ensure that sheâs comfortable and the child has all that he/she needs. If she knows that you love her child, she just may come around to loving you eventually! [â¦] https://joannawillis.wordpress.com/2010/06/19/tips-to-avoid-baby-mama-drama/ [â¦] I am encouraged! I so needed that. I believe itâs extremely hard not to feel like you and your needs will always come second. But you have shown me a new light.

 WATCH LIVE Watch Live: NBC 5 News Share Oh, Matt. On the day after the Bears running back was named the NFL's Offensive Player of the Week, an item about Forte ran in one of Chicago's most-read gossip columns talking about a baby mama drama. Â Stella Foster reported that Forte's ex-girlfriend is pregnant, and that his fiancee had broken off their engagement and relationship.  "I happily announced in May that Forte had gotten engaged to Chicago's Danielle Daniels at the Trump International Hotel in New York while they were there attending a promotional event. Forte gave her a big diamond and the couple later flew to his home state of Louisiana to celebrate with his parents. Well, surprise, surprise! On Tuesday, Forte broke the news to his faithful and beautiful fiancee that his ex-girlfriend, who lives in Louisiana, is pregnant with his child and will deliver in November  We say again, "Oh, Matt."Â  Baby mama drama is never something you want to bring into your football season. You did something dumb. We won't get as specific as Foster did, because the magnitude of your dumbness probably started to sink in right around when your ex-fiancee said, "It's over." Luckily there are plenty of people to turn to in the locker room. Lance Briggs, Brian Urlacher and Tommie Harris all have their own version of baby mama drama. But maybe you should go with the advice that Tony Romo gave to Jay Cutler in light of Cutler's romance with reality-TV It Girl Kristin Cavallari. Put on your blinders, and focus on football. Memorize the playbook. Dive into film study. Think about your running routes as you fall asleep and the passing ones as you wake up. Another 200-yard game just may ease the pain.

According to published reports, G-Unit associate and 50 Centâs assistant, Dwayne McKenzie is being accused by his ex-girlfriend, Shana Chin, of playing a role in the torching of the mansion. The 5,200-square-foot home that was gutted by a suspicious fire was at the center of an antagonistic legal battle between the rapper and his former girlfriend. According to Chin, she was dating McKenzie, who now lives at the multi-million-dollar mansion; and testified that McKenzie often carried a gun and had talked of torching a house that belonged to the rapperâs ex-girlfriend. Dwayne Mckenzie Once the report surfaced, McKenzieâs attorney fired back, stating that Chin, who is currently suing McKenzie for damages and medical bills, is a greedy, fame-hungry woman out for money and the chance to meet rap stars. McKenzie, who has yet to respond to the allegations personally, was also arrested in August of 2009 for allegedly assaulting another woman [not Chin] in 50 Centâs Long Island mansion.

Â  Remember all that drama back in 2008 when now Lakers baller Josh Powell's baby mama Emily Peniche blasted him about trying to take their child away from her?  Well they are STILL in a nasty custody battle over baby Patience.  And despite Emily blasting him abiut being a dead beat and just trying to get back at her, it looks like Josh just got one leg up on her. Â  More when you read on.... 


 Video of Emily from last year
 Â  Emily put her story on blast 2 years ago to gain support and protection from the alleged hell Josh was putting her through.Â  But this past Monday, Emily was arrested in Norfolk, VA for allegedly transporting over 2 lbs of cocaine around the Norfolks area: Emily L. Peniche made an initial appearance in U.S. District Court on Wednesday afternoon. A magistrate judge ordered her jailed pending a bond hearing Monday. Peniche and Lakers forward Josh Powell, who met while Powell played with the cross-town Clippers, have been involved in a much publicized custody dispute over their daughter. Peniche posted a tearful 10-minute plea on YouTube last summer accusing Powell of refusing to return the girl, Patience, then 3. Peniche was arrested Monday with co-defendant Samuel Q. Moses after Norfolk police received a tip that the two would be transporting a large amount of cocaine from New Jersey to Norfolk that day, according to a criminal affidavit filed in court by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement. After Moses and Peniche crossed the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel about 1:30 p.m. that day, a Norfolk police investigator stopped their car. A search revealed a kilo of cocaine, or more than 2.2 pounds, wrapped in a girdle and stuffed inside a duffel bag, the affidavit says. Source
 So maybe there was a reason Josh was trying to keep their baby from her after all.Â  Drama!

									I figured I would start a baby mama drama thread, lol. I'm sure it'll come in handy. My DH, son and I live in NJ for now. The step-kids and baby mama live in RI. We are planning to move up there but the job market is the main factor stopping us. =\ So, we have the kids for the summer. They are due back on Sat but now the youngest got sick and she didn't give us the health card. We are about to make the trek back up there early so he can get to his doc. Baby mama tells DH's mom that J needs to start acting like a father and take him to the doctor. Mind you the kid is sick because she didn't take him to the ear doctor before we picked him up. (We didn't know he was having ear issues at the time because she supposedly took care of it months before) She just said he got water in his ear and there are drops to put in there. I look at the drops and they expired 8/08! She tells my DH on the phone that she has only taken him to the pediatrician because it's "too hard" to get an appt with the ear doctor.. you know the one that put the tubes in his ear... and DH is the bad parent?! The last time she took him to the ear doc was when his school told her he couldn't come back without going to the doc and having the issue resolved.

									I have so much baby mama drama it's not even funny. This B****Â (excuse the language)Â has called CPS on me when my daughter was a week old. She tells her son that he can't play with my kids at my house or at school. She has broke into my cell phone account and changed my plan. Now she can't figure out the passwords so she gets it so my account is locked and I am not able to pay my bill online because I have to call to unlock it. I just gave up and call in my payments. The most irritating thing is that I can't prove its her. This lady is so off the hook she is the definition of drama. The sad thing is is she is in a relationship and her man doesn't say anything to her about obsessing over her ex. They haven't been together for four years. She needs to get over it already. I honestly wish she would grow up and be a mother instead of a psyco.

									Before we finally got custody of my two step sons from their mother she would always pack HORRIBLE clothes for them to wear becuase she knew that we either had already or would buy new clothing for the boys to wear and they would get sent home with the better clothing. DF and IÂ KNEW that she had better clothes for them to wear because either we are our family had gotten them better clothing but she did it just to get more. Its pretty bad when you get custody of two children and they come to your house with EVERYTHING they own in two grocery bags. LUCKILY we had a whole room full of things just waiting for them that we had had the WHOLE time we were dealing with their mother!!

									Ugh I hate baby mama drama. My husband's ex has custody of their 3 kids. She has always tried to turn them against me and hubby. She has always told the kids that I am racist and that I hate them because they are mixed. (Totally not true, and completely fabricated by the mind of a psycho) - By th way, baby mama is black, my hubby is white, I am white - just for clarification. Anyway, so all the kids hate me because they think I hate all black people. I will NEVER be able to havea normal relationship with them because they think I hate black people.

									Oh don't you just love baby mama drama? I know I DON'T! My husband has 2 boys from his 1st marriage, whom I love like they were my own children. Their mom currently has custody and they live in northern AR, us in TX. It's not ideal but we are making it work, with NO help from her. She refuses to meet us or anything when it's time to get the boys. She has been trying to make the boys "forget" who their daddy is for the last 3 years, trying to convince them that her new H is their dad. They actually get in trouble if they don't call him "dad."Â  For a long time, every time we got the boys, they were calling their dad by his first name. It broke my DHs heart!Ok I could go on forever but I need to get ready for school. SOOO happy to have this board!!

Hi ya Ginger ;) I won't be on here venting but will offer support whenever I can. Casey's ex-wife Tammy is a saint and we are good friends. We have had our disagreements but what friends don't? We are very lucky to have a relationship with her that works for all of us!

									That's awesome that you have such a good relationship with your husbands ex.Â  My parents always kept it civil and still do.Â  Now that I'm a "stepmother" and have issues with the ex my stepmother feels a little free'er to say what she really thinks a bit more, but for the most part everyone is friendly enough.Â  I have tried that with my DB's ex but it doesn't always work out.Â  It seems to be best for everyone if we just don't try either way.Â  But my ex's girlfriend and I get along just fine too.Â  We join forces when it comes to classroom birthday parties and soccer practices etc.Â  I think it really helps my oldest son to see that.

									oh this is a great thread, cuz i totally would have started it if you hadnt! Â I just saw the new board announcement on my home board- and couldnt be happier to have a place for Blended families. Â I grew up in one myself so some of the issues im seeing with my DSS's mom are things i saw from different perspectives as a kid.anyway... my main gripe with DH's baby mama... is she can NEVER. BE. ON. TIME. Â EVER. Â Â there are times she is over an hr late picking him up or dropping him off. Â then we chewed her out for it a week or two ago, and we agreed she would drop him off for his sisters bday party at noon on sunday. Â what time does she drop him off? Â TEN AM! Â TWO HOURS EARLY! Â wtf?!I love how when DH is late picking him up (part of the reason he doesnt do the switch, i cant stand his tardiness), she throws a effin fit, but if we get pissed cuz shes late she has a coronary about "arguing with her in front of her bf"

									All I want to say is that I hope you ladys don't look at all the "baby mothers" out there like they are worth nothing. Yes i agree there are some that are just very dramatic and like to make their BD miserable however there are some ladies out there that are really nice. We are all someone's mother and we do not know when we would be on that side of the road. As a single mom myself I can say that I would NEVER use my child to manipulate NO MAN or even make them miserable, if they are doing good by their child there is no reason why the mothers should be a$$es however if they aren't doing right by their child I would let God take care of that. We all pay for every wrong doing that we do in one way or the other.hope you guys don't take this as bad.

									WOW, what a way to start!Â  Talk about momma drama!Â  I have 4 stepkids of whom we have joint custody.Â  My DH divorced his ex abt 9 years ago and we have been together 4 years.Â  She told the kids Im a prostitute he met on the street and that I was his 9th wife.Â  She also told them n way could our LO be his because he could only have children with her.Â  Long story short, we havent seen any of them in a year, all phone numbers are disconnected, she is billing the wrong insurance all over town even though we have the child support office send her copies of the insurance cards 2x and that is documented.Â  Oh I could go on and on.Â  it is horrible and hopeless and I miss my stepkids every day.

									Situations like this are always hard, that is for sure. I can't say that things are all rainbows when it comes to my ex. He was difficult and wouldn't work together for anything. He had a very hard time accepting that I left him for a white man and that his kids would be raised by a white man. Just silly. I saw him 2 years ago for child support and he tried having me thrown in jail for not allowing him access to the kids, total BS. He has our address and phone numbers but refuses to come here to see them. UGH In ways I'm grateful that I don't have to deal with him but sad that he isn't a father to his kids.

									That's good for you! When DH and I first met, his ex-wife was cool. Then, one day she did a 360. It was pretty nuts. She has calmed down since then, thankfully! But, she has her moments. She destroyed my DH's reputation so much that many of his friends don't talk to him because they listened to the horrible things she said about him.. none of which is true. She even had his mother thinking these things until I set her straight about what happened.

									Oh I understand what you are saying. I just created this as a place to vent about the actual baby mama drama that goes on.. it's like there are some MILs that are awesome and some that are nightmares. It all depends on the person.

The Exclusive with Nuri Muhammad Defending Farrakhan: The MGT&GCC Vanguard Respond Critics of Farrakhan and the Issue of Women Covering Themselves read in: 13 min In the United States Black babies die almost three times more than white babies, from the time a woman is pregnant until the baby reaches one years old.Â  When I am out-and -about in the community, many are surprised to hear this statistic for the first time.Â  Even OB-Gynâs and Midwives seem confused and overwhelmed by the disparity. However, I am not surprised or confused.Â  This disparity makes perfect sense when we put pregnancy and childbirth in the Black Community in perspective. Did you know that Per the CDC: ÂBlack women are 2.5 times more likely to begin prenatal care in the 3rd trimester, or not receive prenatal care at all. ÂBlack babies are four times as likely to die as infants due to complications related to low birth weight, as compared to white babies. As a midwife in a community clinic that only accepts patients who are insured by Medi-Cal and/or other State/Federal insurance programs, I see many pregnant women daily.Â  The majority of those women are Black or Latina from underserved communities, and living at, or below what we consider the poverty level.Â  You know, the women and girls that we pass by daily in Black and Latino Communities. If it is their first time at the clinic, and they believe that they are pregnant, we start with a pregnancy test.Â  If the pregnancy test is positive, and they plan on continuing with their pregnancy, they are scheduled for routine prenatal care at the clinic. What we discover from this point forward in most cases is saddening, sickening, and just plain unacceptable! Many of the young women who enter prenatal care are pregnant by young men that they are not presently in relationships with.Â  In fact, many never really were in committed relationships.Â  Oft times, it is someone that they know from the community, or met while out.Â  This person may have been cute, or attractive, may have had a nice car, or seemingly had what they considered a lot of money, and, onâ¦and onâ¦ with the superficial reasons.Â  What happens after that?Â  Uncommitted sexual relations, and then an unwanted pregnancyâ¦babies created by two people whoÂ arenâtÂ in love with each other, and may not even really know one another.Â  In this situation, when we ask the women how they feel about the pregnancy, most say something like, âitâs okay, I can handle it on my ownâ, or âIâll be fine, my mother did it on her ownâ¦â These women tend to struggle with finances, nutrition, housing, emotional stress, substance abuse, and other psycho-social challenges. Others who come into prenatal care, who say they are in relationships, struggle in the relationshipsâ¦ They may be experiencing domestic violence.Â  The partner may not be faithful.Â  The partner is not supportive when it comes to attending prenatal visits, or he may not be happy about the pregnancy.Â  Many times the partner is unemployed, or a member of a gang.Â  Basically, these women are like the single women, in bad situations. Of course women who enter pregnancy with all the issues that we have discussed and even some physical challenges are more likely to have poor outcomes.Â  How could she not be at risk?Â  She has no peace of mind, no comfort.Â  Who can she turn to?Â  Her social challenges eventually manifest into physical challenges such as high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, and maternal obesity; just to name a few.Â  Her immune system becomes even more compromised, because she is not eating well.Â  She has no appetite, because she is consumed by all of her challenges.Â  It is definitely not an optimum situation, and in my ten years of experience I am confident that these are the reasons that more Black Women have poor outcomes. Over 70% of Black Babies are Born Outside of Wedlock!Â   Why is this okay?Â  What happened within our communities that caused us to support being a âBaby Mamaâ?Â  I mean those of us who have had babies out of wedlock clearly recognize that it is a tremendous struggle to make ends meet.Â  Why are we not delivering this message to our daughters and sons?Â  Why arenât we encouraging and supporting marriage? Being Married is Whatâs UP!Â  Other communities have recognized that strong marriages build strong families, and strong families build strong communities.Â  Pregnant women who are happily married have happier pregnancies.Â  These women are not left to make a new baby alone.Â  They have a spouse caring for them so that they can concentrate on giving birth to a god. That is a tremendous task in and of itself.Â  These women donât have to be overly concerned about finances, or housing, or nutrition.Â  They have a partner working hand-and-hand with them.Â  They can concentrate on fulfilling their role in the relationship â the feminine role. Returning to Our Queendom.Â  We cannot continue to let our daughters believe that they can make and raise a baby on their own.Â  We are allowing them to CHEAT themselves out of true happiness; the happiness that God intends for them.Â  They are turning their backs on natural law, which always leads to disaster. Historically, Black women did what they had to do to keep families together.Â  That day is gone.Â  Today, we have to stand up and take our rightful places in the community. Furthermore, our rightful place is NOT being a âBaby Mamaâ!Â  It is being Wife, Mother, and even Domestic Goddess; the first teacher, the first nurse. The role of wife and mother is so important, but we have allowed society to define and belittle that role.Â  Mothers are powerful. What is the answer to the disproportionately high infant mortality rates in the Black Community?Â  Healthy and Strong Black Marriages!

 News broke this morning that Washington Redskins DT Albert Haynesworth has once again found himself in hot water.  Haynesworth is in the cross-hairs of New York-based exotic dancer Silvia Mena. The former Pro Bowler and alleged father of Mena's unborn baby, is being accused of skipping out on the child she is carrying. In the past, Haynesworth has dealt with allegations of being a clubhouse cancer, an overrated and overpaid player, and just a general pain in the rear end.  Now, the $100 million defensive tackle faces another off the field issue that could cost him a large chunk of his Redskins contract.  Silvia Mena is a 25-year-old exotic dancer from New York.  Mena states that she met Haynesworth during Super Bowl week and then traveled to Haynesworth's home in Tennessee for another private session.   Mena's lawsuit claims that she is four months pregnant with Haynesworth's baby and that the Redskins DT has bailed on his responsibilities.  According to USA Today, Mena said that, before bailing on her, Haynesworth originally promised to help her personally and financially.  "It is very stressful, I cry all the time," Mena told the New York Post. According to USA Today, Mena's lawsuit reportedly stands at $10 millionânot only for medical care but also for pain and suffering.  The Redskins are currently on the hook for $40 million guaranteed of Haynesworth's nine-digit contract.   "This man is worth millions," Salvatore Strazzullo, Mena's Lawyer, told the New York Post. "She has had to apply for Medicaid to take care of her pregnancy."  We'd like to send you the most entertaining NFL articles, videos, and podcasts from around the web.

Guess Who Cristiano Ronaldo Baby Mama Is ...
 Related Articles Piping Hot Comment Overload Around the Web Top Parenting Stories Parenting Topics Top Lifestyle Stories Lifestyle Topics Top Entertainment Stories Entertainment Topics Top In the News Stories In the News Topics The identity of the mother of Cristiano Ronaldo's baby has been revealed, and she's said to be an American waitress he impregnated during a one-night stand. Ever the charmer, the 25-year-old soccer stud wooed her with the words:  "Me. You. F&$K. F$#K." Not understanding (or perhaps not believing someone would be so blunt?), he had to clarify for her by drawing a heart on the foggy restaurant window. "Me. You. Kiss," he tried a little more tactfully.Â  Apparently that worked. When she discovered she was  pregnant, she contacted him through his agent to tell him of the baby,  who Ronaldo named  after himself. He is said to have paid her $15 million to keep her  identity hidden. If true, it sure didn't work, did it? I  wonder if he'll try to get his money back? The Sunday Daily Mirror says friends say Ronaldo doesn't plan to tell his son of his mother's identity until he's 18. Good luck with keeping that secret. Meanwhile, it doesn't seem Ronaldo has been tamed at all by the event or fatherhood. âThis week he has on Â­Facebook  contacting women who will talk dirty," a friend told the Mirror. âHe is determined to be the best father he can -- but he doesnât equate that with having to settle  down.â I wonder how long it will be before the name of the waitress is revealed and she goes on to write a book ... or star on a reality show.

Lil Wayne baby mama dramas continues a week after the rapper release from prison. Grammy-winning rapper has reportedly been accused of having another child with a woman claiming she birthed Wayneâs son eight years ago. A Missouri grandmother has hit Weezy with a paternity suit  ordering Weezy to take a DNA test in order to prove that he is the  father of her 8-year old grandchild. (Miss Info) The rapper reportedly has only a few weeks to take the paternity test. In August, while he was in jail, he was served with a legal  letter demanding he submit to a DNA test to determine whether he  fathered an eight-year-old boy with an unnamed Missouri woman. The  childâs grandmother obtained an order from a judge which required the  Lollipop hitmaker to take a paternity test before September 10, but as  the star was behind bars at the time, the deadline was pushed back until  December 9. This isnât the first time that Wayne has been targeted in a  suit like this. In August 2009, an exotic dancer at a Los Angeles strip  club claimed that the New Orleans rapper had impregnated her. The  28-year-old currently has a 15-year-old daughter with high school  sweetheart Antonia âToyaâ Carter, a two-year-old son, a one-year-old son  with Lauren London and an 11-month-old with Nivea. During his recent incarceration at Rikers Island, Wayne released a âMotherâs Dayâ letter to his childrenâs moms. âTo the mothers of my beautiful children, there remains  nothing but love, adoration and respect coming from my heart. Even with  the mistakes Iâve made in my life, you give me reason to smile in a  place where they attempt to break your spirit each day the sun rises. I  love my babies with all my heart. And the fact you brought them into  this world only gives me more and more motivation to write these words.  Happy Motherâs Day. Last but not least, my own mother, Ms. Cita.  You are my heart and you are my soul. Please donât ever forget that.  Weâve been through everything one could possibly imagine together. With  each obstacle that has come our way, you have handled it with the grace and dignity I can only hope to mimic. Even writing this, itâs tough to  come to grips with the fact I cannot spend this special day with you.  Like you always preached, a man must accept his own actions â good and  bad â and learn from them. And thatâs what Iâm doing. Mom, I love you  more than you will ever know. Probably more than I love my own self.  Enjoy Motherâs Day because you deserve it. Also, find comfort knowing  your son loves you and misses you like crazy.â (Weezy Thankx You) Your comments below Lil Wayne is a real ni*** and does real  things and he takes  kare of his responsebiltes as a man.

Woman Claims Love Child FOLLOW SPORTS Suggested For You GET THE NEWSLETTER YOU MAY LIKE FOLLOW HUFFPOST HUFFPOST NEWSLETTERS Devon James, the self-described "porn queen" who says she had an erotic two-and-a-half year affair with Tiger Woods, now claims that she and the famous golfer had a secret love child, RadarOnline reports. According to the web site, James says she gave birth to the secret son in 2001, three years before Woods married stunning ex-model Elin Nordegren (PHOTOS). It was reported yesterday that a bombshell documentary airing Thursday will claim Woods fathered a secret kid with one of his illicit lovers. RadarOnline reports that it has seen photographs of the alleged love child, but that Woods has not taken a paternity test. James came forward in March, purporting that Woods paid her for a "two-girl party" in 2006. According to James's claims in the new report, the first interaction occurred years earlier, and the pair reunited in 2006. At the time of her March revelations, naughty pictures and a detailed escort listing for James could be found on a Florida web site. Women linked to Tiger Woods Raychel Coudriet, the daughter of Woods' neighbor, met the golfer when she was just 14. Devon James is a "porn queen" whose alleged escort listing contained plenty of naked pictures. Emma Rotherham allegedly had early-morning sex on Woods' office couch. Tiger reportedly loved to see her in black stockings and suspenders. Jaimee Grubbs (PHOTOS) saved a voicemail from her lover, as well as steamy text messages. Jaimee stripped down for two magazines (sexy PHOTOS). Jamie Jungers (PHOTOS) says she and Tiger had "wild" and "crazy" sex against a wall. She also claims to have slept with Woods the night his father died. Jungers, who allegedly once worked as a stripper, parlayed her newfound fame into jobs pitching vodka and an auction web site. She also appeared on the Today show and Dateline. Julie Postle (PHOTOS) allegedly met Woods when she worked as a cocktail waitress in Orlando. Tiger was reportedly "obsessed" with Postle and "really hunted" her. She was also photographed in a bikini. Susie Ogren says she took ecstasy with Tiger and he hoped "to get me into bed." Rachel Uchitel (PHOTOS) was the first of Tiger's alleged mistresses. Woods reportedly emailed her once to say that "I finally found someone I connect with." In another alleged email, Woods shared a steamy fantasy of Uchitel simultaneously having sex with Derek Jeter and Bones star David Boreanaz. A National Enquirer source called Uchitel a "celebrity whore." Loredana Jolie, a Playboy model, was allegedly "one of [Tiger's] favorites." She is planning a book that will spill the beans on Woods' alleged sexual encounters with men. Theresa Rogers has been described as a "cougar" who allegedly boasted that she taught Tiger "everything he needed to know to be a great lover." She reportedly conceived a baby while she was seeing Woods, but an article suggests she believes the father is a Serbian basketball player she was also seeing at the time. According to another article, Woods told Rogers that he only married Elin Nordegren to boost his image. The 40-something Rogers may have negotiated a payoff in exchange for her silence. Joslyn James is a porn star (PHOTOS, VIDEO) who has starred in films such as Porn Star Brides and MIA - Milfs In Action. She is also wanted in Washington state. Holly Sampson is a porn star (NSFW pictures, video) whose films include Descent Into Bondage and Diary of a Horny Housewife. She may have worked as an escort (NSFW) and appeared in a video in which she describes her "amazing" sex with Tiger Woods. In another article, she spoke about the "sensual, beautiful experience."  Afro Saxon HeatBringing the Scoops to you Puff Daddyâs Latest Baby Mama Speaks OutâBy Memona Tsehaye Related Posts: One Response to âPuff Daddyâs Latest Baby Mama Speaks OutâBy Memona Tsehayeâ Leave a Reply Categories Archive Other Sites Recent Comments Tags Home >> Features >> Puff Daddyâs Latest Baby Mama Speaks OutâBy Memona Tsehaye  Sarah Chapman has come fighting back, after she had been in a dispute with her arch rival Kim Porter. The two ladies, both mothers to superstar P.Diddyâs children, have become increasingly eager to get the story straight, which all began with an interview given by Porter, in Essence magazine. Although it is surprising that Porter has decided to come forward with her side of the story now, several months after her official break-up with P.Diddy, whose real name is Sean Combs; it was even more surprising for Chapman, who did not appreciate Kimâs comments regarding her relationship with the mogul or her pregnancy. In an exclusive interviewÂ with Sandrarose.com, Chapman said that she was shocked to find that Porter claimed she had never met her and was not aware of her pregnancy, until after she had discovered she also was expecting twins with Combs. Angered, Chapman says: âShe definitely knows who I am, [Kim] knew about my pregnancy prior to her getting pregnant. In fact, Kim and I met [Sean] at the same time.â Through the admission of Porter, who found out about Chapmanâs pregnancy through a friend, decided to keep the news to herself- including Combs. She thought having been blessed of becoming a mother for the third time, (she has 16 year old Quincy Jones with former partner singer/producer Al.B. Sure and Christian, 16,Â  fathered by Combs), it would be too stressful to waste her thoughts on things like Combs straying? Porter explains in the interview. â But I wasnât even on it like that because I was pregnant, and what was bubbling inside me was a blessing from God. I couldnât let my energy be on that. â Over the years, Porter has been criticized on several occasions, for looking like a doormat and just keeping up with Combs infidelity. Any other woman would have probably reacted differently, as Chapman expresses her worry and amazement to Porterâs statement:âThe scary part is that any woman can be with a man and not even mention to him âoh, I heard you got another woman pregnantâ â thatâs really scary. For the longest time she never mentioned my pregnancy to him. She kept it a secret to herself so it wouldnât take the shine off of her,â said Sarah. âI thought [Sean] was lying, but he said Kim never mentioned my pregnancy to him.â The very humble Chapman, 35, is a Spelman graduate, a liberal arts women college. She strongly emphasizes that she doesnât seek the spotlight- unlike Porter, 39, already an established model and actress. Given the opportunity, Porter had always enjoyed the spotlight, red carpet events and just generally carried the pride in being âDiddyâs girlâ. âThatâs not for me. I donât enjoy that. Iâll let Kim have thatâ says Chapman. Surely, it must be difficult to find yourself in a situation like Chapman, having a child by an international star such as Combs, and being portrayed the other woman. Women literally throw themselves at his feet, much to the amusement of Mr. Combs of course. He proudly portrays this image of being a successful businessman, producer and musician, who under no other circumstances puts his children first. When twin daughters DâLila and Jessie James were born, Dec. 21, it was a subject that could not be avoided, it was in every publication. However, Chapman quickly jumps to Combs defense and only has positive things to say about him:âI know it sounds very clichÃ©, but we really are friends.â Chapman was eager to make it evident that the main reason for this exclusive and only interview she has given is to ensure she is portrayed in a positive light, as she has never tried to sell her story or fight for Combs attention. Over the years she has soldiered on, focusing on her number one priority, raising her daughter. Chapman said of Porter:âNow that sheâs lured me out, let me paint the picture. I donât want anyone else to paint the picture. I need to have a voice. I want to be heard. She also took this opportunity to squash rumors, regarding a million dollars, which was apparently given to her by Combs, in order to terminate the pregnancy. She was furious at these allegations:âIf he gave me a million dollars I wouldnât be calling him every month for child support,â she joked. âI mean, he pays me on a monthly basis, but there are rumors that he offered me a million dollars hush money.â Itâs clear that Chapman is a lady, whose main focus is the well being of her daughter, yet is fiercely protective of Combs, being the father of her child. Yet, sheâs eager to tell her story on a national forum, for the sake of her reputation that up until this point has hardly been heard of. She said: âI donât have a voice,â she said softly. âI donât have a forum to speak about my child. He has the forum. Iâm not a superstar, heâs the superstar. Heâs the person that should be out there acknowledging his child. Iâm going on with my daily life and raising my child. We do what we do. We go to Sesame Street and the zoo,â said Sarah. Daddy's Girl, Lil Cutie              You completed a number of fine points there. I did a search on the subject matter and found the majority of folks will agree with your blog.

  young step moms?  crazy baby mama drama? ME TOO! Related Products My boyfriend's son is a gorgeous 21-month-old with an absolutely insane mother, who I just save all of my wishes for him to turn out nothing like. I am twenty years old, and have never read anyone else's story like my own, but I KNOW there has to be others out there in my same situation...If you relate, or are just interested in the subject, I will likely be interested in your story as well, take a stop by my blog. http://underagedenraged.blogspot.com/ Mmmm, well I think referring to your BF's ex/mother of his child as an Evil witch making up a website about it does confirm your young age. It's hard to believe a 20 yr old would even stay around for this but if you do; Gird your loins, it's going to be a long & bumpy ride. I certainly hope you do not refer to this childs mother this way in front of him & my advice to you would be to back off, let your boyfriend handle the details with BM. You are not even married to this guy and have emeshed yourself into this mess that's really none of your beeswax. Sorry, think you should change your phone number, stay out of it. Actually think you should go focus on school, and enjoying being young rather than hooking up with a guy that's already got a kid & Ex to deal with. Good grief, you should out traveling, learning, maturing and seeing the world. Not saddled down with someone elses baby (whom it seems you intensely dislike) all for some guy? Come on! Plenty more where that came from. What does he have to offer you? And don't say " but He loves me!" or "I love him". That only goes so far, trust me. You are only young once!! Best of luck,
~Cat You know, I don't think there's a woman over 30 on this site who would disagree with Catlettuce on this... Why?
- Because we don't want you to have any fun? (Absolutely not. We want you to have fun - lots of it.)
- Because we don't think you're mature enough to handle it? (Maybe - can't say. I've seen some *really good* young mothers.)
- Because we are across the board against step-families? (Heck no! We're here...)
- Because you're very young and inexperienced? (Probably. Different from being immature, which we're not saying.)
- Because BioMom sounds like a psycho? (Yes. Absolutely. BIG problem. One YOU can't solve because YOU are not the problem...) But the MAIN reason is that by becomming deeply involved in this, you're signing up for a lifetime (OK - 20 years) of trouble. Deep, painful, nasty, possibly dangerous trouble. A just-out-of-his-teens father to a baby (no matter how sweet) with a psycho BioMom brings a LOT of baggage to the table. I know you love him --
I know he's wonderful -- But at your age, there are LOTS of wonderful guys out there with NO baggage! NO baggage! Guys with college degrees, promising careers and no psychos in their closets. There's college (if you want it) and a promising career for you too so long as you don't limit your options by tying yourself down to some other woman's baby. You KNOW all the warnings about becoming a teen mother... How it limits your economic future, your career horizons, your marriage prospects. You were smart enough to avoid those pitfalls -- So why VOLUNTEER for them now? When I read this post, it happened to be on the same day I read a post written by my 24 year old niece on facebook. My niece married at 19 (IMO, on the rebound from her HS sweetheart ~ she became pregnant from Mr. Rebound & they got married... he was 18) Everyone told her about the red flags & warnings but she ignored them all, saying she was not a child, she was capable of making good decisions in her life. The marriage had some problems in the second year & they split up. Then reconciled & she had baby #2 about 8-9 months later. That child is now 2 and they have filed for divorce. Not sure why they didn't make it but from an outsider's perspective... he was too young/immature & she thought she knew it all & could have it all 'because she WANTED it', I think she had baby #2 in an effort to turn him into the family man she wanted. It didn't work. Well, she has had a new boyfriend... almost from day 1 of the breakup... she likes to post pictures of her boyfriend & her in suggestive poses. She has posted pictures of her boyfriend, cuddling with the kids watching TV. She writes a bunch of stuff that appears she is trying to make her ex jealous. I have no idea if it's working.. BUT: The other day, he came to pick up his kids & his new girlfriend came with him. My niece went off on her (on FB) about how dare she come with him and pretty much issued an open threat... IMO, it was a very immature reaction after all the stuff she has put out there with her new boyfriend... another one of those "I can do it, but if you do it all hell will break loose" My point, this is what I see young people doing (being very immature, making decisions without thinking of consequences) and this is the kind of immature reactions that some young people have. I would hope my niece grows up & realizes that just because things didn't work out with him (and admit they were BOTH immature & it's not all his fault) Funny thing is, she acts as if they are being mature with each other... but this was before he found a girlfriend. Why anyone would WANT to get in the middle of that kind of drama is beyond me.

    			 View this image âº Yeaterâs Account Of The Tryst: âImmediately, it was obvious that we were mutually attracted to one another, and we began to kiss. Shortly thereafter, Justin Bieber suggested that I go with him to a private place where we could be alone. I agreed to go with him and on the walk to a private area, he told me he wanted to make love to me and this was going to be his first time.â At this point the two went to a bathroom. âWe went inside and immediately his personality changed drastically. He began touching me and repeatedly said he wanted to fuck the shit out of me. At the time I asked him to put a condom for protection, but he insisted that he did not want to. In his own words, he said that because it was his first time he wanted to feel everything.â âHe was on top of me with my legs around him. At the time I was on top of some type of shelf. The sexual intercourse itself was brief, lasting only approximately 30 seconds.â Quotes courtesy of Gawker View this image âº No word on whether or not this is the bathroom.

 Who wouldn&apos;t get stressed out? After Mariah Yeater reportedly dropped her dubious paternity lawsuit against him last week, it looks like Justin Bieber&apos;s baby mama drama behind him -- which means his girlfriend Selena Gomez can breathe a sigh of relief.

 The singer-actress, 19, opened up about the fracas (which made headlines worldwide) during a Thursday appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. "What a crazy two weeks it&apos;s been!" Ellen DeGeneres remarked to the star, 19. "To say the least," the "Who Says?" singer admitted. "I have been [alright]."

 With Yeater&apos;s lawsuit dismissed -- and unearthed text messages from Yeater about the real father of her baby further disproving her claims -- Gomez confided things are "good" and less stressful. Indeed, Gomez and Bieber, 17, have shown a united, affectionate front throughout the scandal, in which Yeater claimed he fathered her 4-month-old son, Tristyn, during a quick encounter backstage at an L.A. concert a year ago.

Top Posts & Pages Follow âDating Do's, Don'ts & Duh!!â  I soooÂ dislike the term âbaby-mama,â but itâs become the staple meaning of an out-of-wedlock single mother. For the purposes of this post, however, divorceeâs are included under the term âbaby-mama.â âBaby-mama dramaâ is the term used to describe the angry, bitter, heart-broken out-of-wedlock single mother. Both terms create hesitation on the part of a woman dating a man with a baby-mama and /or baby-mama drama. The hesitation develops from the understanding that along with the man, comes the kid(s) and the baby-mama. Women are very territorial with their men, so it takes an understanding woman to date a man with a baby-mama. Most women are less concerned about the kid(s), and are more concerned about the woman who will be apart of their lives for at least eighteen years. Iâve been the girlfriend of a man with a baby-mama and baby-mama drama. It is no easy task depending on how intense the drama is, but I have a few Doâs and Donâts to share with you. 1) Donât Get Involved in the Baby-mama Drama: It is only natural that a man will probably vent to their current woman about the qualms and disagreements between he and his baby-mama (I really hate this term). Your role at this point is to be a support to your man, not a coach. Listen and be attentive to his emotions, but donât âegg him on.â The issues with the mother of his chid or MOC (much better) is his battle to fight, and your battle to be supportive of. You can make helpful suggestions, but leave the negative comments in your mind where they started. 2) Donât Be Naive: It is important to understand early in your relationship that you and the MOC may not get along. Be prepared for the worse and hope for the best. Remember the not so funny sitcom âAll of Us,â based on the relationship between Will and Jada Pinkett-Smith, and Willâs ex-wife? The new wife and the ex-wife eventually became friends and everything was peachy-keen. Yeah that may not happen to you, so be ready if ish hits the fan! And finallyâ¦ 3) Do-Let Your Man Handle It: If the MOC is constantly interfering in your relationship, let your man handle it. I touched on this before when I said itâs your manâs battle to fight. For example, if the MOC is being an instigator, bad-mouthing you, or being disrespectful, your man should handle it. Iâm not saying donât stick up for yourself, but your man should have already had the MOC in check! He should put her in her place long before she even gets to you. The more you entertain her shenanigans, the more she will feel like sheâs winning. Furthermore, if he is not controlling the situation, then the MOC and her drama will be a constant problem in your relationship. Donât let her win! *Check out the Video Pick of the Week, Jill Scottâs âGettinâ In The Way,â in the sidebar. Â  Great post.
Which pretty muchs sums it up as one of my stronger personal preferences of not getting involved with a man with a child/ren. Thank you Nekole! Finding a man 30 and over without children seems rare, unfortunately, but I can accept a man with a child. I donât know about more than one child though. Iâve been there, done that, lol. so true words to live by, when I was married I talked with exhusbandsâ daughter mother one time, we discussed haircare, and views of discipline, I would punish when needed, and follow exâs view on no spanking, after that talk if she had any issues when daughter stayed with us she was to address to him, if he agreed with her he would talk to me, when they had blowups I stayed out of it, we were respectful toward each other if we were at birthday parties, and recitals, when she got married had to remind exhusband to stay out their household he could not dictate relationship with her stepfather as long as child is not endanger they have their way and we had ours You brought up a good point about reminding your ex-husband to stay out of the household of his âbaby mama.â I guess itâs an adjustment for all parties involved. It would be interesting to hear a manâs perspective on dealing with the stepfather and/or the âbaby daddy.â Hey there,  You have performed an excellent job. I will definitely digg it and in my view recommend to my friends. Iâm sure theyâll be benefited from this website. hi!,I really like your writing very much! percentage we communicate more about your post on AOL? I need an expert on this area to unravel my problem. Maybe that is you! Having a look forward to look you. Thanks so much!!!! Iâm dating a man who I care very much about with some baby mama dramaâ¦Iâm being very supportive of him, but this helps me understand it a lot more. Hi Alison!  Iâm glad you found the post helpful.  The best thing a woman can do in this situation is to be supportive to her mate, but also be smart.  I hope you continue reading and happy holidays to you!! Yeah, this isnât easy. What about a situation where the new girlfriend is 20 and the man with kids is 29/30? Then his baby mama (MOC) is also near 30 and thinks she can talk down on the girlfriend. Ugh, advice? Hi JJ! Thanks for your comment! Your situation sounds very unpleasant, but the key to resolving this issue is to have a very serious conversation with the MOC. Donât create tension with the MOC, but you have to make it clear she has to respect your current girlfriend. Approach her calmly, but let your words be stern. Also, it might help to use the concept âif the shoe were on the other foot.â Try explaining to her how uncomfortable it is if she were in your position. The matter definitely needs to be addressed, but it is for you to address and not for the girlfriend to address. So I recommend to handle it before your girlfriend reaches her breaking point. It has to be hard for your girlfriend, regardless of age, to be disrespectedâ¦especially by your ex. Take all feelings into consideration. I hope you find this helpful. Happy Holidays!! Hello, I been living with my boyfriend for a year. Things went pretty fast, I say this because we didnât date long before we moved in together. He has 3 kids! lol. My issue here is he dosenât put his foot down when he has to. I sometimes feel he feels that by keeping MOC and kids happy is 1st then me. We have already talked about it many times but each time is just a âsorry, I will make sure it dosenât happen againâ  I am just getting so tired of this :( Hello âSick and Tiredâ
I understand your frustration because of course Iâve been there before. Please do not take offense by my words, but when dating a man with children you are NOT his priority. So if he feels the MOC and his children are 1st, he is absolutely right! That does not mean you are not a priority to him, but you are not his 1st priority. So as the girlfriend of a man who has children, you have to live with it. However it is the responsibility of your boyfriend to keep the peace between you and the MOC. He may not want to be the middle man, but he has to get the MOC to understand you are a part of his life now. He too has to set boundaries with her; boundaries for her and him. Itâs important for him to balance time with his children and you as well. Iâd be lying if I said it will be easy, but this will be an obstacle to overcome in dating a man with children. I hope this helps & keep me posted! Happy Holidays!! Thank you for responing back. Oh, and no offense taken at all. Itâs just that this is my 1st relationship with a man with kids. I have no kids and was used to dateing men without kids, So itâs really hard at timeâs for me and Iâm sure for him too. I knew I was going to have to deal with things like this from the beginning. I guess what happened as well that really frustrated me and thanks to the other stories here I know now I was wrong wasâ¦ I tired to help him giving him advise (at 1st) with dealing with MOC not bossing him around anymore. But, then it truned into me actually telling him what to do. So, when he didnt do it or only once, thatâs when the Hulk in me would come out. lolâ¦ We have the kids every other weekend. So I guess itâs not that bad at all, it could have been worse. Right? He is a really great man and father. I Know he tries SOOO hard to keep me happy. Thank you for the eye opener. Your right, his kids should be his 1st and only priority. I better make it up to him today ;) lol Once again thank you for this helpful website. Happy Holidays! Hey Diana! Youâre very welcome and it sounds like you have a man who loves you and is trying to balance. Thanks for your comment and I hope you continue to read. Happy New Year!! :) I actually disagree. The child is his first priority as his child. And you are his first priority as his girlfriend. If you become pregnant, you are and should be, of the same importance if not more (actually) than his BM. Simple facts. What if the MOC is making passes at your boyfriend and being sneaky an your man said he handled it but not like a real man stands up for his woman what do you do how can you trust him or anything they do or talk about.? I am 20 years old and Iâm dating a guy with a daughter who just turned 1â¦and him and his baby mama relationship is well and he told me that in 3 years he might have another kid with her for his little girl. Should I stay or leave ASAP? Iâm literally playing house with him if you ask me. I think Iâve put up with with so much because I never met someone like him who has done so much for me and Iâve grown so much with his help. Should I just be friends or just drop him. I know Iâm in denial about our situation I just want another point of view and some advice on what is the best way to go about it. Hi Taj! Thank you for your comment. Where should I beginâ¦ By no means am I judging you, but I have to keep it real with you that your relationship sounds like a mess. You are with someone who makes it clear he wants to have another baby with the mother of his child. What about you? He is blatantly letting you know that he has a plan and future for the mother of his child, but no plan and future for you. Are you supposed sit on the sidelines while he and his ex conceive the baby? Itâs a mess!! Woman to woman, open your eyes. People show you who they are by their actions and words and he told you who he is with that statement. You say heâs done so much for you, but in the same sentence you say youâve put up with so much. Itâs a mess!! Itâs best to take a step back and really look at the relationship; the past, present, and is there a future?  You have a lot of life to live and the last thing you should do is waste time on someone who does not make you a priority. Love yourself enough to walk away. I hope this helps Tajâ¦best of luck to you! I and my boyfriend have a 2 yr old together. We have been together for 4 years we separated for 5 months and he had a baby with another female. We live together and the other mother lives 3 hours away so when he visits he comes back but the last time the mother had surgery and asked him to see about his daughter that was fine but I have a problem with him cause he stayed. He says itâs nothing wrong with it cuz itâs about his child  BUT I FEEL LIKE ITâS WRONG AND Disrespectful!! He should either stay at a hotel with his daughter or bring her back home.  Is it wrong or right for him to stay? Hi, I recently started dating someone who is living with his baby mother. She has literally drained this man and made him depressed. He actually sees a therapist once a week. They were together for eight years and had a child. They have been together for ten years now. So I already knew what it was before hand. The on n off relationshipâ¦ The arguments the nagging. We had met before Xmas and instantly fell. We spent nye together and the messages she sent him confused me because he told me they were done. Apparently, this chick has some issues with the word noâ¦and him being done. Until hr brought me home. Nowâ¦its his house..he inherited itâ¦they are no longer done and he informed her that she was a tenant and if she doesnât like that he is in s new relationship she could move to the second floor..problem with that is her son is on the third floor. So..that didnât happen. So he wants to move me inâ¦only problem is..she wants me on the second floor or I canât be thereâ¦.. WaaaaaaaIT. Its my mans house right??? This girl has literally turned him into a babyâ¦he canât even make decisions on his own. She wants him to put her name on the house.. Give her the carâ¦like he feels he owes her something because of his son. So Iâm moving in the houseâ¦ Only because I make him happy and he can actually eat and not be stressed
.but my question isâ¦how do I support him and build him back up without  taking heat from her.? Hi Confused and Worried! I hate to say it, but this situation sounds like a mess. The mess is with the baby mother, however your man takes ownership in the mess too. Understand that you canât build a manâs backbone, you can only support him. You will have to come to terms with the fact that baby mother hold reign in your manâs heart, mind & apparently the house. There is no reason why they live together. I understand they have a son but there has to be an alternative. If they are in fact not together and live together, and now youâre moving in, think about how confusing that is for the child. It just seems to be a lot going on and if you are okay with taking the backseat to their awkward relationship, then fine,but donât move in thinking youâre going to change things or change his outlook on things. He needs to take care of his situation; that is not your responsibility. Keep in mind too that if you get in the middle, nine times out of ten, especially based on the current situation, you will not win; baby mother will. Take time to think about what you really want out of a relationship and that will help you deal with the matter at hand. I hope this helps. Thanks for your comment! I know this is super old but if you are still providing advice I would love some right now.  I have been in a relationship for the past 2 years with someone I love.  He has 4 kids and i have noneâ¦yikes!  Now, i like to think im a smart girl, so i had an understanding coming into it that his kids are #1 obviously, we need to be 100% clear and open about the boundaries in the relationships he is to have with his baby mamas, and it wont be the easiest thing in the world, i know i will have to accept some things i may not like, no arguements here.  For the most part I was under the impression that the boundaries were understood, and that his baby mothers would be the last women he should be caught crossing the line with.  Well the other day his BM randomly posted a comment on his social media saying âyou know i love you boy, like foreal #soulmatesâ, and immediately i felt some type of way about it.  I understand in a lot of BM/BD situations that love is still going to be there, im not naive about their history, but I am not down for women being on my manâs page talking like that.  So I expressed my concerns to him and he just defends defends defends, no big deal, dont worry about it blah blah.  well just as I was about to drop it, I seen him leaving unprovoked comments under her pictures saying things like âIm in love all over again #honeybeeâ, âyou know you are minesâ âi still have a chance booskieâ etc.  This obviously really pissed me off, and when i confronted him with the info his response was, âok i flirt, so whatâ.  Those couple of events made me feel like i had no choice but to end it, being that we have dealt with this type of disrespect several times in the past with little random women, and he knows that crossing the line with BM was a deal breaker.  I have been VERY accepting, of his unfortunate situations and this really just feels like a slap in my face.  He doesnt seem to care to find out how to fix it and i just cant wrap my head around it.  WE used to talk about marriage, and together forever, and our friends and family say we are meant to be, I was really really in love with this man, i gave him unwavering loyalty and complete honesty.  I am struggling to really believe that these past 2 years were pretty much meaningless because at the end of the day they always go back to the BM, and i think the only way I would get the respect i deserve is if i act crazy.  I dont wanna be crazy, I just want respect.  Would i just be fighting a losing battle?  I am not in agreeance that his BM should take priority over me unless its dealing anything with the kids.  But the i love yous, and soulmate, and im in love all over again ish is MY lane, and in this lane the BM is an ex bitch, so if you are telling me that it is ok to have that type of relationship with his BM, or that its not my place to address it, then i know that it is really time for me to go. it seems like with how things are going you should talk one last time and leave it at that. Everyone knows that flirting with your ex is taboo. Especially when youâve already got someone else. If heâs trying to say itâs not a big deal, heâs being willfully ignorant. It is a big deal because at this point in time she is only his BM. He doesnât need to win her back. He has you, but heâs not treating you correctly in this situation. I think you should reevaluate if you feel loved. Do yourself a favor and be sure to do not what you want to do, but what is best for you. Having issues myself with this one. My boyfriend and I are totally in love. However, his childâs mother is constantly a problem. He entertains her every command, all in the name of his son. Having kids myself with another man, I have never seen a father give so much of himself, time, money or anything like my boyfriend does for his son. The childâs mother is constantly accusing me of being psycho and jealous of her. I know he doesnât want her.  Thatâs not the issue. He is so afraid that she will pack up and move with their son. He calls her a piece of crap mom and says that he is the only parent the child has. I simply donât see it. Heâs not the custodial parent. I donât understand why he thinks everything is how responsibility. I know I am all over the place, but I canât get over this issue. I donât know how to make her leave me alone. Sheâs always telling me that she doesnât want him but could have him if she decided to. I really believe that he hates her. She schemed and got pregnant on purpose, and was married to someone else! I need help to put her in her place! I am BEYOND stressed out about the baby mama situation. & I call her that because she gives no shits about her son. This kid is strictly used as ammo against his dad. She has complete control over every situation in his life. My boyfriend has been living with me for a few months now. Everything is going good, but sheâs constantly an issue. His son has been over here twice now. I love that little boy with my whole heart. But we had kept our living situation not really a secret, but we didnât tell her that he lived with me. When he took his son back to the mom she flipped her script because their little boy brought me up. So heâs no longer allowed over here anymore. Instead of putting his foot down or getting a lawyer to get visitation rights, my boyfriend said well if she wonât let me see him while living here Iâm moving out. Am I wrong for thinking that is just going too far? I donât have any kids, but I know how my parents were. & thatâs not it. She wants him back with her, & since he wont, their son is the only thing She can use against him. Iâm just getting so upset. i have  a question my ex jus got of mail becuz me and his situation we had and the past now his babymama taking to get with him but when their baby was born she didnt want to b with him so wat can i do now itâs interfering me n him geting bk together Hi Janina! The decision is not yours to make.  Sometimes women make the mistake of trying to direct the man towards the decisions we want him to make or we attempt to fight for a man to keep him near, but ultimately the decision is up to the man.  He is the one who has to decide if he wants to be with the mother of his child or be with you.  If he chooses you, then again it is his responsibility to make it clear to the mother of his child that he does not want a romantic relationship.  Donât be mad at her if he is not making that clear to her and playing with both of you.  Talk to him and really listen to what he tells you about his feelings for her, for you, and proceed from there.  I hope this helps!  Thanks for your comment! Hi!  For starters great article, short, sweet and too the point!  Iâm hoping you can give some insight on my current situation.  My BF and I have been dating almost 9 months and his son is really young, 8 months to be exact.  His sonâs mom will send him text multiple times a day sometimes updates on what the child is doing or sometimes just random pictures of the child, it could be first thing in the morning, throughout the day or bedtime, usually all of the above.  Daily.  I understand that the baby is young and they both want to be apart of all the babyâs first, such as first words, steps, first time doing anything, plus the cute quirky things their baby will do and especially if the baby is not feeling well.  But is this relentless consistency normal?  She requires that when they child is with him he does the same thing.  Needless to say, it bothers me, truly, because it seems excessive.  Iâve never said anything to him about about, my intent isnât to take anything away from himâ¦.but I know how it makes me feel. Uneasy.  My thoughts have been to let it ride till the child is older, this is new and exciting for them and i donât want to cause any more issues than they already have between them, but I donât know what to do here. This is my exact same situation!! My boyfriend and the babyâs mom (baby is two months) text daily about the baby. Occasionally it gets slightly off topic and it really bothers me. I understand asking how the baby is doing since she is so young, but every single day? I donât know if I am strong enough to handle it. I know he tells me he hates her and is only being civil so she doesnât slap him with child support, but the texting daily is getting annoying to me! I think itâs mostly my insecurities, but I donât know. When I bring it up he gets angry and tells me the same things, âIâm just being nice so she doesnât ask for more money blah blah blahâ. Hi Ann!!  Please read the comments I made to Ash; I think it will help you as well.  You are both dealing with very young children and if you are second-guessing how much you can deal with it now, then you wonât make it to see the childâs 18th birthday.  At this point I assume you are in the relationship with the idea of it hopefully being long-term, so if you are unsure now, then it will not work; the child is not going anywhere and neither is the mother of his child.  Take a good look at what you really want in a relationship; maybe dating someone with baggage is not for you.  Good luck and thanks for your comment!! Hi Ash!  I have to be brutally honest with you here; youâre asking for a lot and you should tread lightly in this situation.  I say that because you are dealing with a young child, 8 months old, so it is not your place to be annoyed that the childâs mother wants to include the father in the young childâs day-to-day activities.  While the amount of contact may be excessive to you, as long as the contact is about the child and nothing inappropriate, there is nothing to complain about.  Does your boyfriend have an issue with the amount of contact from his motherâs child?  If not, then you do not have a right to complain.  The one thing I stress about being in a relationship with someone with a child/children, is you are not the priority; the child/children is the priority.  Iâll be honest with you, at this time, you are simply the girlfriend of 9 months, but his child is his forever.  So think about where his priority lies.  Also think of it this way, you wouldnât want to be with a man who is not involved in their childâs life, especially if they have an ex who is encouraging their involvement.  You could be dealing with an ex who is causing problems of keeping the child away from the father or having issues with you; instead you are dealing with an ex who simply wants to make sure the father is a part of their sonâs day-to-day activities and growth.  I definitely would not mention this to your boyfriend.  You are choosing to deal with someone with baggage, so you just have to deal with it.  I hope this helps and thanks so much for your comment!! Hi again!! Lol Iâm a little late to your response.  I love your blogs, but I didnt go back to this one to read your response since it was an older blog!  I wonât make that mistske again :-) Anyway, I did day something about it, it didnât seem appropriate to me at all,  some of the picks were more her than the baby, I understand signing up for baggage, but if something makes you as uncomfortable as this made me,  I donât see how keeping your lips sealed would benefit the relationship.  But I am younger and still learning!  Turns out, he felt (and she was,) she was using that and other things as a way to control their situation, not just an update to keep him involved in the childâs life.  Heâs finally wised up and is taking her to court for custody, so hopefully they work things out! Him and I are no longer together, but best wishes to them!  Again love your blogs! Donât quit! Hi beautiful ! First Iâm sorry for this long message â¦ You probably have a lot to do but I need some advice concerning my relationship and if u got 5 minutes to read it would help a lot :) thanks x
Itâs been a little bit more than two years that I am with my boyfriend. I have a daughter with another man and he has a child of 4. Weâve been living together for about a year now.
His childâs mother doesnt accept the break up although she has boyfriends but when she found out he was with the same girl (me) for a few months she understood it was kind of serious and she got really mad and decided not to let him see his kid anymore. He tried to go there and see their child but she gets very violent breaks everything yells and never let him enter . I know he suffers from this and I really feel bad about it. I canât stop thinking that if I wasnât with him , maybe he would be able to see his son and everything would get better for them . We only talked once about it (heâs not very talkative about that and I donât want to be annoying ) he told me he wanted to stay with me , didnât wanna go back to her and will find a way to see his son anyway. He also wants me to meet him but itâs definitely not possible..  She tried to contact me to insult me many times but I never replied . I donât know how to act as I really love him and feel bad at the same time .  Another thing is that she uses their child to get him back. For eg she decided to accept his visits but ONLY if he stays at her place and sleeps there. She doesnât want him to take his son anywhere without her . as he refused at first  he couldnt see his kid but last week he finally accepted and stayed 3 nights at her place.. I wasnât okay with him sleeping there tbh but I let him go with no argument As I want him to be happy and see his child as much as he can. I thought he would at least text during these 4 days but his phone was off most of the time â¦ He only called once for like 20 secs to say he was okay but tbh I really felt like I was the âside chickâ and felt rejected . He said he didnât wanna her to get crazy as she gets mad if heâs on the phone ! Now I am apprehending next time he goes there and think i should talk to him.. What do you think about this ? You said we shouldnât get involved and let the man handle it but I m not sure heâs actually handling the situation :( Thanks a lot for your reply .
Cassie Hi Cassie!!  I read what you wrote and there is one common denominator in your situation, which is your boyfriendâs âbaby motherâ has all the the power in your relationship.  First let me make clear that his childâs mother will have an issue with ANY woman he develops a relationship with, so it is not necessarily about YOU!  These are her issues regardless, so you have nothing to feel bad about in regards to you being the reason why he cannot see his child.  Also, yes I always preach to let the man handle any situation between his childâs mother, however your boyfriend, unfortunately, is not handling the situation at all.  The fact that his childâs mother demands he comes over to her place and spend the night to see his child is absurd, and if he were truly handing it then he would say âNoâ and take other measures to make sure his parental rights are not rejected.  In my opinion, this is the problem with men in situations such as this.  Not enough is done legally to make sure the fatherâs rights are exercised.  By no means do I think it is an easy task, but also a man should not want to live his life being controlled by a woman who is using their child as bait for attention.  So no I do not believe your boyfriend is really handling the situation.  This is also exemplified by his actions of following through on her demands and going to her place and spending the night.  As you state he spent the night for four days and you spoke with him for 20 minutes; if that does not sound like hog-wash to you, then I donât know what else to say.  There is absolutely NO excuse that 1) he even thought about disrespecting your relationship by spending the night at another womanâs house, let alone he actually did it; 2) that even after he made the ridiculous decision, he was even more disrespectful by not calling you for more than 20 minutes, and finally 3) that he proved to the mother of his child that she runs him and your relationship by following through on her demands.  My only suggestion to you is to take a good look at the situation at hand and your relationship, to determine if it is what you really want.  I understand your boyfriend may not be talkative, but you better find out what is really going on because itâs time you take control of what YOU want in a relationship and what your boundaries are.  I hope you find this helpful and either way I hope you figure out what is best for YOU!  Thank you for your comment!! My baby mom left me with the kids and ran off with another man now she lives with him and trys to pick up the kids when and how she feels yells at me and wonât try to talk civil and her boyfriend always is with her when she comes around and he always trys to fight even if I donât say anything he also tells her what to say and do he seam really mean and my kids cry not to go with them when ever she decides to show up their is way more going on thwn this but what should i do in this situation.

Hi :) What a great threadâ¦ I am finding myself unsure of how deal with a situation with âBMâ. I have been dating a man for 4 months. He has a 3 y/o he shares custody with. They seem to co-parent well, although they were also sleeping together casually at the time we met. Our relationship took off fastâ¦ they faded out and he solidified âusâ to herâ¦. So he and her had an agreement they would introduce a new partner to each other before this new person met the child. He asked this of me roughly around 2 mos. I said sorry- too early (meanwhile BM making passes at him). My stance was that I would like to see everyone making good choices before I got involved (without adding extra drama to the meat of my advice needs they both seem sort of immature in how they hand their relationship- minus the child)â¦ so he has gone back and forth, decided to introduce her anyways- sheâs adorable and gets along peculiarly well with my 12 y/o daughter. This has been on only a couple occasions, very lightâ¦ the he went back to no- you cant be around her to keep the peace with BM. I understood completely and respected why. But now, heâs back to I want you to hang out with us- but the compromise is he is to tell the BM every time the daughter is around meâ¦.  Soâ¦ I just donât know what to think anymore. I have always kept my dating life private from my daughters father. Its my life, my business. The only partner he met was a man that I was solid with for years and moved in with us.  I think itâs ok for anyone to request this.. but having been a single parent for so many years I donât think its reasonable. Am I wrong for feeling this way? Should I just take one for the team and meet her??? I honestly just donât want to; I think itâs too early, and she is hurt and wants him back and I feel sheâs trying to control him and who the child meets which I think is unfair to him and his life. I think its not an uncommon issue that they just need to work through in time and isnt my place to get involved with her. What do you think? Any thoughts appreciated :) What can i do about my problem. Never married my manâs bm has been in & out of jail & has an open warrant for her arrest right now for stabbing her current boyfriend. She has no job and is a meth user. My man is the custodial parent. Despite all of this he still drops theyâre son off to visit with her and she keeps texting him and tryn to make her presence felt with me. The other day she texted him happy birthday and he said nothing to me about but simply texted her saying only my friends and family can do that making no mention of me his woman. Im at my wits end n would give this worthless chic respect if i thought she deserved it. Im still tryn to wrap my mind around the fact that he is ok leaving the little one with her knowing her circumstances. What do i have to say to make him understand that if he doesnt put his foot down n be firm im leaving him. Please help. Oh! & fyi: she stabbed him too when they were together, prostituded herself, cheated on him several times, got pregnant & had an abortion by another man she cheated with, lied to police saying he pushed her so they would lock him up, abandoned theyâre son with different people to go party, & admitted to sleeping with at least four of his friendsâ¦do you still think that this moc deserves to make her any kind of priority? In some rare cases i believe that your man should only make the child his first priority not the MOC. If your bm has proven to be unfit, cant provide for the child, using meth, determined to be unfit by the courts & a fugitive wanted by authoritiesâ¦your 1st priority should be your child and only your child. Anybody with a functioning uterus can make a baby but if you arenât holding your weight as the childs mother you get no respect & your man shouldnât have any either. Your not doing your child any favors by exposing him to this type of person. Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:  You are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

           27 38 1 So my daughters father has now gotten another girl pregnant. He isn't really involved in my daughters life that much but yet we are having to go to court over custody. How am I supposed to handle a new girl and a new baby? Do I accept the new baby even though it isn't part of my family? What do I do? I still care about my daughters father but I don't trust him and we most likely won't ever get back together, so how do I handle this?

She's the 20-year-old California woman who claims to have taken 17-year-old Justin Bieber's virginity and given birth to his baby.  Yeater filed a paternity suit against the popstar yesterday, alleging she had sex with Bieber backstage at one of his concerts, and is requesting a paternity test to "scientifically confirm" that he is the father.  According to court papers obtained by RadarOnline, Yeater alleges that she was approached by a security guard after a concert and asked to come back stage. She claims she and Justin moved to an area where they could be alone, at which time his "personality drastically changed." Yeater claims Justin then, "began touching me and repeatedly said he wanted to f**k the sh*t out of me. At the time I asked him to put a condom on for protection, but he insisted that he did not want to ... Justin Bieber then quickly took off my clothes and we had sex. He was on top of me and with my legs around him." The 20-year-old who gave birth to her son, Tristyn Anthony Markhouse Yeater in July, also says in the lawsuit that the sexual encounter only lasted 30 seconds and at that time it was clear to her that Bieber was embarrassed and did not want to exchange phone numbers.  Reps for Bieber told TMZ they hadn't seen the lawsuit but denies Yeater's allegation. Meanwhile, Justin commented on the lawsuit by tweeting: "so Im going to ignore the rumors...and focus on what is real. an opportunity to help by doing what i love. Judge me on the music! Love yall!"

Jealous of my husband's baby mama Comments (11) Badge nomination  Related Photo Clubs Related Groups Please sign in Get Help Membership & Newsletters BabyCenter Shortcuts BabyCenter Mobile Our U.S. Sites Our International Sites DH and I have been together and married for a year now. Things have been ok. He has a son who's 4 years old who lives two hours away from us and we never see mainly because we have no car right now. We are currently TTC my first (my screen name is the name that I'm going to give my first daughter when she finally comes). My problem is that sometimes I feel insanely jealous of DH's baby mama because she was able to have a kid (who was an oops) by him and I'm having difficulties falling pregnant because of PCOS. I met her once and she's cool and all. I just envy her soooo much. My DH scolds me for feeling this way towards her mainly because they were never serious about each other and her getting pregnant just happened. I'm also scared that since DH already has a kid that he's notÂ trying as hard to get me pregnant because if I end up not havingÂ children what's it to him? He already has one. I feel like his BM took away the whole 'his first born' experience from me. On the other hand I absolutely LOVE my stepson. He's so adorable and handsome. He's DH's double and boy is he intelligent. He speaks both English and Spanish fluently. Are these feelings normal? Living w/ PCOS & IRÂ  DD born January 1, 2016 Thank you so much! I've been feeling like this ever since we started TTC and although it's hard I'm going to have to remember that DH made a lifelong committment to me and not her. I'm going to have to just relax about it and stop putting all my energy into being jealous because it's getting me nowhere. Living w/ PCOS & IRÂ  DD born January 1, 2016 OP - I had this thought once of she took that experience away from me but I quickly squashed it. It's a dangerous thought IMO. First because your jealousy will eventually ruin your relationship if the resentment builds. Secondly, because we all had lives before our current relationship. We were someone else's SO. It's just life and there's nothing wrong with it. My DH had a son before with his ex wife. In that first marriage and the first born, he learned how NOT to be a husband, and learned how to be a father. The second time around he's more mature and was AMAZING during my pregnancy. He and his ex wife hate each other because they were both awful to the other. So...he knows now. Just a different way to look at it. The more you live in your head and don't try to enjoy your marriage and the birth of YOUR first child...the more you're going to lose out in the now. And you'll get pregnant with your PCOS. My best friend was on clomid and they were all BFN's. It wasn't until she went to a fertility specialist that she was told that clomid makes your "environment" hostile. You have to have IUI so the sperm actually have a chane to survive. GL. Things are ok? Forgive me if I have you confused with someone else, but didn't you recently post on a different board about some really crazy stuff between you and DH? He cheated or something and you went all crazy on him and took his bus pass and phone and threatened the girl he cheated on you with, saying you were going to kill her among other craziness? You never mentioned he already had a kid. Oh my Lord..... I think feeling jealous of BM is the least of your problems, as that actually seems normal to me. Happy SAH, ERFing Mommy to my Little Buddy ~Layla~Â    Dream Husband of 11 yrs!Â Watch out...DS got his Driver's License!Â 7 y/o brilliant girlÂ  Yes, I still have a farm andÂ ( . Y . ) I believe your feelings are normal. Its tough. My only advice is for you to try and focus on the positive things about your relationship with DH. Everytime you get a negative thought just try to shake it off with a positive one. If you don't find a way to control your feelings now, I'm afraid it might get worse. You'll feel jealous when you're pregnant for the 1st time and DH has BTDT. All these factors, thats why its important you stay positive and remember you are his wife.ÃÂ  Another thing, do you have a support system or someone else to vent to other than DH? IDK if I'm right or wrong here but I do know when I was experiencing feelings similar to yours this worked for us. I stopped venting to him. Venting to him only caused my thoughts and feelings to grow as he didn't understand why I was feeling this way and trying to explain for on going periods of time was like opening up that wound over and over again. It was frustrating and caused arguments. Everytime I wanted to say something, I didn't and DH never knew and I had no choice but to move on and talk about something else. It really helped me with my feelings. ÃÂ  I think you may want to try seeing a counselor. I saw one when DH & I got serious and it helped me tremendously with my insecurities. It sounds like all of your insecurities are in your head (which doesn't make them less validated; I'm just saying that it doesn't sound like your DH is doing anything to make you feel like he's not TTC).

Boyfriend's Baby Mama - Should You Meet Her?

 Great article! I have been trying to figure out the best way to have a respectful adult relationship with the mother of my boyfriend's daughter. Great piece, I just met my boyfriend's baby mama for the first time today, and it was a completely impromptu meeting. I appreciate your advice! This is really an awesome article. I have to meet my boyfriend's child's mother today at a funeral and have been so nervous all day, but this really helped me know what to expect and how to act. Thank you so much!

     Can relate to your story and hope you pick up my book <br />"She'll always be his baby momma" coming out soon! Support your man ma and dont back down! He needs you to back him up! Keep doing what your doing!  Would love to use your story in my book I am constantly AMAZED at the ridiculous and constant agenda and evolving drama that I witness on a daily basis that my male friend has to deal with regarding his ex-girlfriend who is the "Baby Mama" of his 2 daughters.  I suspect her behaviour is a manifestation of her control issues, as the happines and well being of his children is extremely important to him (as it should be).  Manipulation is a constant theme in these dramas. She thinks she is being clever with her million excuses to try to pry never ending amounts of money not just from him, but also from me.  Anger and temper tantrums are one her modus operendi.  One sneaky little trick is saying she "has to use the bathroom" so she can come into the house and scope out what she wants to "borrow" or outright steal.  I have such empathy for those young girls - to have a constantly angry mother must be a terrifying ordeal. I was like you, but I wanted to be so that I could sit back and observe. There were no family outing though. Your boyfriend was right it does patray a false image, and she does still want him. If he is nice enough to share things with you. You should not have a problem with telling him how it makes you feel uncomfortable when he does this and would he like if you dated other people. Because thats what his childs mother has in her mind when they are together. They are no longer a family. His intrest should be with his child. Also counseling not needed they aren't married thats all her sick solutions to getting him back. Look at it for what it is, them spending some kind of time to gather. She needs the couseling not him. My fiance open up to me and told me about his baby mam I listened to her calls and text messages for a year and a half. I didn't want to meet women in his family that had anything to do with her. I knew it would be drama, I set back and enjoyed myself with may man each day and witness this woman call 3 or 4 times a day. I witness her trying to scam him out of money. Every word that comes out of her mouth is a lie. So what I am getting at is sit back observe and it will  let you know about him and her. If he truthful and fatithful you will know if you want to stay or leave, Just keep watching her in silence trust me you will learn the pattern and you will be two steps ahead of her always. She is always going to use her child as a pawn so your friend might as well get use to it because she wants him. Since I met my fiance child she is not allowed at my house that only for right now it doesn't bother me.  I know it hurts him but, he is dealing with it and he's going to come out on top. He has a strong women behind him. You have to be strong as well. Make sure you are doing it for the right reasons, and give hime pointers also let him know what you will stand and what you will not. Gain your respect from him. well girl i have been there and back again for a 3 time it crazy deal with the babymama drama becaues my boyfriend has 3 babymama it crazy i get  alone with one of his babymama but the other 2 hell no. that y i just let him deal with that. and girl u can  get throw this k.

Donât Call Me a Baby Mama â Themâs Fightinâ Words
 Related Articles Piping Hot Comment Overload Around the Web Top Parenting Stories Parenting Topics Top Lifestyle Stories Lifestyle Topics Top Entertainment Stories Entertainment Topics Top In the News Stories In the News Topics For a handful of reasons â because Iâm a black woman, because Iâm a journalist, because I was born short and stout with a bad overbite â Iâve been on the receiving end of some pretty ugly name-calling over the years. Everything from an n-word to a b-word to a no-talent douchebag to a bucktoothed hippo (itâs okay, you can laugh).  But if you really want to push my buttons, call me a baby mama. Itâs tacky. Itâs weighted with prejudice, and it has all kinds of disdain attached to it. And at the very frigginâ base of it all, itâs grammatically incorrect. Shoot, at least call me a âbabyâs mother.â If you want to get really technical, every woman who ever birthed a child would fall under that category. Itâs just some of us are going through the hellfires of single parenthood while weâre raising our tots. Like bling-bling, haters, and gettinâ jiggy, baby mama is an African-Americanism, yet another fine product born from the hip-hop vernacular that the mainstream picked up on and beat to death. Around our way, some 70 percent of households are being headed by single parents, most of them women. Mine is one in that hefty majority.   I generally hate when people inject stodgy dictionary entries when theyâre trying to make a point in speeches and sermons and articles, but I have to share what the Oxford-English Dictionary says a baby mama actually is: âthe mother of a man's child, who is not his wife or (in most cases) his current or exclusive partner.â Well damn. Not only are we unfortunately single mothers, weâre basically â by that definition, anyway â either pretty desperate, pretty stupid, or pretty complacent. Maybe all three. I mean, wouldnât a woman have to be to bear a child in a non-committed relationship? Thatâs just what that excerpt above suggests. And even if youâre not an avid follower of the OED, itâs what the term âbaby mamaâ implies whenever someone says it: another single chick foolish enough to have procreated with a man who didnât think she was worth committing to. If youâre married and have a baby, youâre a wife. If youâre divorced and had a baby, youâre an ex-wife or, at the very least, âthe mother of so-and-soâs children.â But if you're a single female parent, youâre that dreaded two-word combo.Â  Iâll admit there was a time when I was head over heels about my daughterâs father and wouldâve done anything for that fool â heck, I look at my grades from my sophomore and junior years in college now and could gouge my own eyes out for not doing better academically because I was so worried about maintaining our relationship amorously. Even when I found out I was pregnant, I didnât really sweat it because I had starry-eyed dreams of us getting hitched and heading up a little, happy family once we graduated and moved on into the real world. But things didnât work out the way I intended (thank God for intervening!) and ... well, you know the rest. The 'baby mama'Â label doesnât take any of that background into account. It doesnât give any single motherâs story validity or credit, as a matter of fact. It just dumps a whole heap of asinine assumptions about a woman into her lap and lets society at large basically poke fun and pass judgment about her failed romance or precarious situation or fleeting moment of bad decision-making, no matter how much she loves the child it produced. Oooh baby mama. Couldnât get him to marry you, huh? Actually yâall, Iâm pretty glad he didnât.   I may have had a baby with a guy named James. I am proud to be Skylar's mother. But Iâm darn sure not anybodyâs baby mama.  Is there a label or term that you, as a woman or a mother, just cannot stand? That just grinds your gears whenever you hear it?

The model-turned-actress, 39, famously discovered she was three months pregnant after she and then-boyfriend, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, called off their three-year romance in 2007.  Brady, who moved on from Moynahan to supermodel Gisele Bundchen, was already a couple months into his new relationship when the actress made her shocking announcement. The ensuing tabloid war had headlines like âOh, no! Iâm knocked up, weâve split up and this is my rival!â splashed across the front pages of the Daily News, and the two runway beauties were pitted against each other in the media.  Even so, however, the âBlue Bloodsâ actress tells More magazine that she refuses to speak out about the scandal that colored tabloid pages a thousand times over. âIâm raising a child, and itâs public. The media creates these dramas, and thatâs not whatâs happening in my life,â she said.  Moynahan has kept her tone light during moments of public drama, remaining relatively mum following Bundchenâs comments in Vanity Fair, and after the arrival of Bundchen and Bradyâs own bundle of joy in 2009, merely saying that she âwished them well.â  John Edward Thomas, her young son, is the light of her life, Moynahan says, and notes firmly that âthereâs not a second that I regret having a child on my own.â The actress, who stars opposite Tom Selleck and Donnie Wahlberg in the new CBS cop series, is very focused on her son, according to her costars.  âSheâs inspiring. She talks about her son all day,â Wahlberg, who is also a single parent, said. âShe doesnât bad-mouth Tom to me, and I certainly wouldnât bad-mouth my ex to her. Sometimes itâs just sharing pictures of our kids and a joke. Sheâs very funny.â  But though she is grateful for her son, Moynahan still struggles with the difficulties of her blended family. âI donât think any girl grows up dreaming of being a single mom,â she said. âItâs a challenge. Here is the most valuable part of your life, your child, and you have to learn to let go and hand him over to the person that you couldnât communicate enough with to have a relationship.â Good for herâ¦ Source uhhhhh ok I support Inter/racial relationships!

My friend Vanessa, a 25 yrs lady, has announced her wedding with a mâillionaire young man Ronald who is the CEO of a MNC. Itâs amazing, she said she just posted her profile on a mâillionaire dâating sâite called âââ-RichMatchmaker. ââMâââ â and received his chat invitations a few days later. Then, everything went so well that I canât believe itâs true! Every love story will unfold on itâs own..ââ-Woodward and both were married to and had 3 children with the same man Paul Newman though he & Joannne nearly had 4 but sadly she miscarried their first. thankfully bridget or Giselle have never had to experience that as it would get all kinds of media coverage now a days where in the old days it as covered up for decades Who the hell cares? -_->zzzzzzZZzzz THATâS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TRY TO TRAP A MAN INTO  MARRIAGE BY GETTING KNOCKED UP ON PURPOSE, SHE BROUGHT THAT ON HERSELF. HOW COULD YOU SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHEN YOU DONâT KNOW THE FACTS!! That is a fact thatâs why Tom left her, she was ready for marriage he wasnât. She got pregnant on purpose and he wasnât ready. He takes care of his kid but he doesnât have anything to do with her. take note black girls. this lady is a MOM not a  baby mama like yall. she is taking care of her kid and has a career. she is not bad-mouthing brady and being respectful of her child as he grows. all you black women on here should learn from this chic. instead of using your child as a f*c*ing ATM card. cosign lol Yeahâ¦all white women are picture perfect moms and all black women are baby mamma drama. If you have a point to make it gets ignored when you make ignorant generalizations.  Fall back or grow up. Im sure she gets plenty in child support.  And im sure he didnt have a problem with helping to take care of his child unlike some people.  Child support orders wouldnât exist if people stepped up and took care of their responsibilities. Iâm co-signing too! how bout you need to not group all blacks women togetherâ¦.smdhâ¦you sound really stupidâ¦.now co sign thatâ¦.dummyâ¦. Whatâs the point of her bad mouthing, it wonât solve anything.  There is a time when you  just have to move forward.  Just when you think you canât move forward, you realize tomorrow is a new dayâ¦everything will work out and you have a beautiful child to enjoy it with. Bridget is Smart for not saying anything bad about Giselle even though she may want to. thatâs like Jacqueline Witt has never said anything bad about Joanne Woodward and both were married to and had 3 children with the same man Paul Newman though he & Joannne nearly had 4 but sadly she miscarried their first. thankfully bridget or Giselle have never had to experience that as it would get all kinds of media coverage now a days where in the old days it as covered up for decades omg shes gorgeous!  looks way better than that horse face man body giselle! Smh Life is full of obstacles, with Tom supporting her Iâm sure that sheâll be fine.

In the wake of getting served with child-support papers at halftime of a Magic/Wizards game, Gilbert Arenas is rather perturbed about his baby mama Laura Govan's approach to public shaming. So says a source in the D.C. media, who was kind enough to share straight-from-the-mouth-of-Arenas thoughts on Govan â sister of "Basketball Wife" Gloria Govan â with us.

 It boils down to his distaste for continually being characterized as a deadbeat dad, which he says he most certainly is not. Before getting into the "he said" part of this whole drama, let's hear how someone close to the on-again, off-again couple explained their breakup: On Nov. 20, Laura kicked Gilbert out of the house because Gilbert did not adequately ask how her day went. This was taken to mean he was more concerned about work than family. Her: I'll go to police if you don't do as I say. This was a tricky proposition considering the ongoing probation from the gun (in the locker room) charge. She allegedly said, "If you try and pick up the kids at school, I will tell them you weren't authorized to do so and that's going to be a violation of your probation." After a road trip, he moved in with Wizards teammate Nick Young, but says he stayed in constant contact with one of Laura's younger brothers (who, as it happens, Laura also kicked out the house). When he learned he'd been traded, he let little bro know. Even though he wanted to see the kids, there was no reason to say goodbye to baby mama. Baby mama stayed in touch with him indirectly, though. As in, she called Magic GM Otis Smith and told him, "If he doesn't abide by my demands, I will ruin this new start for him." Demands to the tune of $1.3 million a year, the kind of stuff financial advisor Lester Knispel wasn't having. Says Gilbert, "Well, I don't want to get into all the he-said, she-said stuff. Whoever the source is, they're pretty accurate on the things they are saying. ... You have enough money to get a publicist, but there's no money for the kids to eat? She's watching too much Basketball Wives." Context in place, here's what Gilbert Arenas had to say about... Advertisement  â¢ The notion that Ms. Govan's been financially frozen out. "She's like that bum on the street asking for money, but if you follow that bum home, you discover he's got five cars and a mansion. She gets 20 grand a month. She got $8,000 allowance. We both did. ... You're pretending your living a bad life, but the facts really are: you get 20 grand a month and you live in a three-bedroom townhouse in San Ramon, Calif." â¢ The fact that his sharks â of the $5,000 monthly care fee â are no longer of this world. Sponsored  "One thing I can comment on is the sharks. My sharks are dead. Yes, somehow, pennies ended up in the tank. I was told the copper distresses them. I'm not going to say it was her, I'm just saying they didn't make it." â¢ On being painted as a deadbeat dad. "All I hear is, âI left the kids.' She won't let the kids see me. All I hear is, âGilbert took everything.' Sure I did. She took a SL600. She took the Range Rover, which I don't mind because she has to drive the kids around. Oh, all my furniture and all my clothes, about $4 million worth of stuff? Gone. And she says she's living in some cheap hotel? Now, I don't know how all of that is going to fit into the LA Quinta Inn â unless you bought the damn hotel." "Sure, I'm a deadbeat daddy. I get it. I'm the best daddy in the world until I didn't want to be with you. And then I'm a deadbeat daddy. I think she did this the last time we broke up." "Look, you have your lawyer. I have my lawyer. Let's do it that way." In the issue of fairness, here's a link to S2S Magazine's "Laura Govan breaks her silence" article from November. Her publicist has now taken to emailing press releases about the whole mess, too. Gilbert Arenas, Laura Govan star in Basketball Wives of the Orlando Magic [Orlando Sentinel] Read This: Gilbert Arenas served with papers by ex-fiancee Laura Govan at Miami-Orlando halftime [Washington Post] Advertisement  Gilbert Arenas Baby Mama's Vengeful Move to Recover Child Support [Black Voices]  Signs That Youâve Crossed Into The Baby Mama Drama Zone Popular Stories MadameNoire Video Despite the stereotypes, baby mamas do not solely represent the uneducated and emotionally disturbed sector of the gender. That stereotype is aided by the tenuous relationships between baby mamas and baby daddy. Things are naturally primal where our children are concerned and at times, your relationship with your babyâs daddy can reach the surreal. Before you know it, youâve unwittingly slipped into a black and white Twilight Zone episode we like to call: the baby mama dramazone. Is it a drug? Is it a place? Hard to say. But it sure isnât easy to avoid.Â  In part, itâs hard wired into who you are as a nurturer, a giver and a woman. Mix in a little ego, where no man is going to get the best of you and walk away like itâs nothingâwell, letâs just say things can pop off like lightning. In the end, allowing any bit of drama in your world is wrong because it has nothing to do with what truly matters: the well being of your children. Besides, what you really want is for the situation between you and the father of your child to be better. A dose of dramazone isnât going to help. Before you wake up in a nonsense world where Beyonce is ugly and you and your baby daddy cause each other agony at the childâs expense, take a a good look around for these tale tell signs that you have crossed into the baby mama dramazone.  Your Ego is Front and Center
 It stings pretty bad when you have a manâs child andÂ youâreÂ still not good enough to be his wife. Your ego takes a blow and wants to lash out in defense. Only, thereâs a good chance your children will get caught in the cross fire. Your ego may even carry that resentment on to your next relationship or worse, dilute your self-worth by making you feel youâre not good enough. Your baby daddyâs unwillingness to be a good father or husband is about how crappy a person he is and has nothing to do with you. Leave your ego out of it, otherwise you could end up in the baby mama drama zone. Yeeesssss MadameNoire is a sophisticated lifestyle publication that gives African-American women the latest in fashion trends, black entertainment news, parenting tips and beauty secrets that are specifically for black women.

MadameNoire Â® Copyright Â© 2010-2016 Moguldom Media Group. All Rights Reserved | Moguldom Multicultural  10 Signs Youâre On Your Way to Becoming a Baby Mama Popular Stories MadameNoire Video  More black women in this country are baby-mamas than they are wives. Some even have multiple children with multiple men. Indeed there are several who qualify as hoodratsâof which such outcomes are expected. However, many are quite the oppositeâeducated, successful, selective. Certainly no one would classify Nia Long as a rat; yet, she has birthed two children out-of-wedlock. 73 percent of black children enter this world at a disadvantageâthey are more likely to live in poverty, and more vulnerable to a life in the animal house called prison. Why? We have grown callous to subliminal media influences and fallen victim to false truths and our own naivetÃ©. You see itâs not necessarily the type of man you date that makes you susceptible; it is the defects in your approach to life and romantic relationships. Here is a list of some of the wrong-thinking that can place you in the position to do it all, alone:  Interesting theories given from a womanâs point of view about how men thinkâ¦interesting I have a lot of friends who are baby manaas some doing good some doing bad & Iâm still on the road to success & I just completed my first of  college that saying Birds of a feather flock together is not entirely true.  Yet.. Pingback: 10 Signs youâre on your way to becoming a baby mama | YNaija() After reading all these comments,  instead of finding who to blame how about we work on a solution?  What needs to happen is the implementation of these âsignsâ. How do we do that? Can you please make Billboards! Lol. Itâs so true though, âTalkinâ is not being together and anyone who wanted to spend time with you that night would have also spent time with you in the daylight too. I hate to think about the low self esteem these young women have but I hate to think even more about the generation of children they are raising and the future effects of this generation without dads.  Pingback: msn emoticons() Pingback: Sex, Drugs, Lies, & Motherhood Â» 10 Signs Youâre On Your Way to Becoming a Baby Mama() Wow. Apparently this is an oldie but defnitely a goodie. Far be it from me to label a child as a mistake. The mistake is getting pregnant and you arenât ready to be a family, provide that child with a stable homelife and give that child its BEST chance. I get so tired of grown folks still acting like this still âjust happensâ. There is no excuse for unplanned pregnancies. It takes âtwo to Tangoâ but we dismiss coparenting! #36&singleraisinganrresponsiblesomebodieschild The reason why most black women are âbaby mamasâ is because their father is not in their lives.Â  whether or not you want to believe it, it always goes back to theÂ man at the end of the day. If a little girl Â has no daddy or father in her life, how in the hell is she suppose to know how a manÂ is suppose to treat a woman.Â  If she has no man to beÂ a father figure and tell what to look out for, why does she get blamed for that.Â  Itâs her mom and dads fault.Â  It will all be a cycle.Â  We blacks often talk about whats going on in our communities but we donât do nothing about it.Â  It you canât take out time to mentor young girls and boys about life and education then shut the hell up!!! At some point, grown women have to stop blaming their childhoods for their mistakes. Assuming that the lack of a father is what leads these women to bad relationships completely ignores the fact that the parental relationship (or lack thereof) is not the only relationship that these women are exposed to. It also ignores all the women (like myself) that grew up without a father and did not end up pregnant (or even with a scare), and it ignores the women with fathers in their homes that have ended up pregnant. Not having a father in the home is a risk factor for being an unwed mother, but it is not causal. And not to be rude, but it serves no purpose to attempt to educate people if youâre going to spread false information, which is what you did above. If you donât know the facts, itâs much better that you not speak at all. I think the best thing for a woman to do is to find a man that has a good relationship with HIS father. Everyone thinks its the relationship with his mother, but that couldnât be further from the truth. Grown women go back to childhood and they go to what feels familiar to them even if itâs not good for them. Just like an alcoholic will usually fnd another alcoholic to be in love with. OR if you saw your mom get her butt beat ever day by your dad you may stragely end up with someone just like that.  Itâs just mind damage and people are not going to realize that unless they have therapy to deal with their childhood issues. Grown women  are still little girls inside and want to be loved.Loving the inner child is important nurturing and caring for the inner child. A father is important but too many black men complaiin about the Queen they already have and that does mind damage to their little girls even if they are in their lives. You must love and serve the Queen, but if you did not grow up with a good father who was around that is ok if you had a great mother who was both mother and father. I agree with you, and I donât think most women want to be baby mamma. Not one woman that is a baby mamma would say NO if that man asked her for her hand in marriage. NO woman would turn that down. In our communities we are taught that we shouldnât expect marriage and that Mariage is an unrealistic expectation for a black woman. Black men act like they donât want t be married and some even act like we are just lucky to be blessed to have sex with them. And so women worship these same men who ainât crap! and that can be why you see so many black women fighting over one black man. He will make the excuse that he loves his baby mamma no.1. and that baby mamma no 2. causes too much drama. Itâs really strange how we are taught in our society to view marriage and I agree with you it is a cycle. We do often talk about whats going on in our communities and you even hear baby daddies talk like they are so all the sudden educated about the problems and epidemics in the black community it makes you want to slap their fake faces. THe man is the leader of the  home. But black men are not geared into thinking that way. Itâs all about being a man so thy make a baby to prove they are a man. And the women make a baby to prove thy are a woman. But you canât tell them that.Believe me I have been through it and met with hypocrisy. I just wanted to point out that this article is not all that true, some women really do want the ring and all they get it and then get dissappointed and they end up being baby mammas because like me they have made bad judgement. But we live and learn. Interesting article but none of these really describe the women i know who have had children with multiple menâ¦I know of a few that are smart and educated, knew exactly that they wanted to have children with a family but just met the wrong man that could not commit, or are too intimidated by the modern woman to be honest enough about their goals..these women have decided to go it alone, raise their children because they have sufficient financial resourcesÂ and join the ranks of âsingle parent by choiceâ. So, this article is clearly geared towards a particular type of woman but does not represent all. [Interesting article but none of these really describe the women i know who have had children with multiple menâ¦I know of a few that are smart and educated, knew exactly that they wanted to have children with a family but just met the wrong man that could not commit, or are too intimidated by the modern woman to be honest enough about their goals] Which brings back to the signs âdating a man who acts if-yâ, âdonât mind being a jumpoffâ AND âusing the pull out method as contraceptionâ.
The women that you knew may be educated wise but they werenât smart enough to leave a man who wonât commit. That means they didnât have respect for themselves to move on to find someone else who will give them the respect they deserve and allow themselves to be strung along and become jumpoffs. To make it worst they didnât protect themselves and got pregnantâ¦..again and again! The women that you know (or your friends) belong in that category. Stop making excuses for their stupid decisions. Well to be honest sweet desire you do not know every situation. My situation was far more complex than âcommitmentâ issues. Not all women who are single moms are what you describe. My childs father and I were very commited living together married he discovered he was gay many years later after we had our daughter. He has scizophrenia commited a crime and got locked up too.So I was a single mom for years after I found that out about him. Believe me he tried to make it work, get therapy but it did not work. We tried but it was complicated. My son father lied about being married and had cheated on his wife for several years I was totally unaware that they were still married. Now I am in a healthy relationship working toward, marriage with a great guy.  This should be required reading for all girls/women. Canât believe some women actually fall for some of the crap you describe here. (âIf-y?â Guys are not iffy about anything; we want to get laid. Period. If thereâs anything else to our relationships with you, youâll know it. If it seems âiffyâ at all, thereâs nothing else to it and youâre being used.)  I think you could make one point more blatantly clear (although you did touch on it). You wonât end up a âbaby-mamaâ (I prefer âunwed motherâ or âmother of a bastardâ) if you donât sleep around. Abstinence is a 100% guaranteed effective form of birth control. If you absolutely have to give it up, go buy a toy and get some counseling.  Tubligation is a good option. It can be reversed at a later time if more children are desired.
Itâs just a day surgery-nothing to it and 100 percent effective. Vasectomies for men were once
touted for world population control, but donât hear much about it these days. Good protection for men if a woman gets with child and claims youâre the dad. The doctorâs medical papers can back up you are NOT the father. These two ways are safe and effective. The vasectomy for a man is done in the doctorâs office, very simple. It can also be reversed if more children are wanted later. And is also not 100% effective. Sometimes, they donât work. Granted, that is rare, but NOTHING is impossible. Except for slamming a revolving door. Thatâs impossible.

For Women Who Want The Ballerific Life!  The girlfriend of a man with a child is a very awkward role. I decided to write this blog because I don't think that it should be. I believe everyone should know their position and as long as you do, lines don't get crossed and toes don't get stepped on. Â  Allow me to let you into my life for a second. I'm a mother, a baby mama if you will. I was with my baby daddy for close to 5 years before I got tired of his sh-t and gave him the boot. It was mainly because he couldn't stay out of jail long enough to be anything in life. I had goals and he had a record, we could never really be. After we broke up he got with a girl who had 2 kids of her own. She was kind of a welfare broad, section 8, food stamps the whole 9. He stuck around to take care of her kids and when it came to his, not so much. During the time they were together he was still in and out of jail. While he was out, I'd let our son visit until his girlfriend pissed me off one day. My son would always complain about going over to their house because the other kids were bad and every time they did something bad, he'd get in trouble with them. But still, I'd make him go because that's his dad. One day I sent my son over and he was really sad. I told him that if he wanted to come home to call me and I'd come get him. Come to find while my baby daddy wasn't my son decided he was ready to go home. He wanted to call me but my ex's new girl decided she wasn't going to let him call. Uh Oh, that will NOT work! Â  This is where the girlfriend stepped out of line. If a child wants to contact his mother under no circumstances do I believe you should step in between that. I don't believe it is a girlfriend's job to discipline a child nor their job to do what's best for a child. You don't raise them so that's not your duty. Should she have let my son call me? Absolutely. You're only going to cause drama but not letting him do so. In my opinion she shouldn't have been left alone with my son in the first place but that's a story for a different day.Â  Â  And now for another story.. So less than a year passes by and baby daddy has moved on to yet another girl (maybe more than that, I have no clue). This girl seems sweet enough, but she's really trying hard to make ultra nice with me. I guess maybe she thinks that will put her in his good graces, I'm not sure, really don't care much. The baby daddy, like clockwork, finds himself in jail again. This time it's looking like it may be for a long time. He calls me looking for sympathy and asking if I'll let our son go visit him every now and then. I've already expressed to him in the past that I don't want my son visiting his dad behind bars. That's not the kind of life I want him to be about. He's a good kid and should stay that way. Against my better judgement however, he asks if my son can visit and I say okay. Not even 15 minutes later his girlfriend texts me (I'm not sure how she got my number). She says that she will be visiting him the following day and asks if she can take my son along. Now any ol' body would probably say "sure, why not" but I'm not just anybody. The last thing I want to do is send my child with any girl that I don't even know. Do I think she's a nice girl? Sure. Do I know her? Nope! So it's not happening. She kept pushing for it and pushing for it. I know she means well but her loyalty doesn't lie with me, it's with him and I refuse to turn my child over to a stranger. Nor do I want him to witness his dad with a new girl every week because otherwise how will he learn to respect women when his own dad can't. Most may say I overeacted but I don't believe so. I told her that my son will go with his grandmother. She proceeds to say "I'll call her and see when she's going" Â  Now, I understand you're smitten for the goon, I understand the feeling, it was me at one point but don't get beside yourself and over your head. My child is still MY child and a mother would never turn her kid over to some woman she's only seen once. I understand she wants to impress him by seeming like she's a down chick and willing to do whatever for him, but she has to remember that she must also know her place. She can't try to play step mom role this early in the game. Fact is, if she even lasts until next year she better believe there are other chicks on the side. Trust me, I've been there. But one thing she will not do is try to use MY son as some kind of "trust" tool. Not on my watch!

 uh oh I'm a single girl with no children of my own, I have dated and been in long term relationships with a man with a child. I don't think your being unreasonable.....I personally thing that unless this girlfriend is about to be a wife, they should take a more laid back position when it come to the bf's child. I always think of how I would react as a parent and act accordingly I agree @ Denise, unless you're married you shouldn't interfere too much in matters having to do with the child. Problem is, I don't think many women think about how they'd react as a mother lol It's a fine line to be played...On one hand you can't allow the child to be disrespectful. Because ladies I've seen how you directly impact the child and its not all positive. Â Especially if the child is older they tend to be more combative towards the new mate. Â But then as a parent you have to have faith in the childs father/mother that they wont put any old body in front of your child. Â Thats what I had to explain to my daughters mom.Â  I agree.Â  It sounds like BD was trying to use his son to make this girl think she was special.Â  I mean really.........if grandma is going, what was the purpose of giving this girl your number in the first place?? @blackfu i don't really trust my baby daddy as far as i can throw him. he uses these girls to get what he wants. do i think he'll bring harm to his child? Never...at least intentionally. but he's a dummy. Â  @Smitty exactly! i think you're right. he wants to make her feel special by making her think she's got some grand duty. she wants to prove herself by trying to handle this huge duty. not with my child though lol grandma is going and thats who my child can go with. @SpiceÂ Â Â Â and keep in mind that she contacted her via TEXT...lol Â  @elevenÂ  you should haveÂ sent her a text backÂ that saidÂ ..."B***H, GTFOHWTBS!" LOL see, and here I thought I was being the typical baby mama dramatic...I know her attentions were good (maybe) but she's out her rabbit ass mind if she thought that I was gonna let that fly! @eleven...see i dont trust my daughters moms as far as I can toss em either. Â But do I think they would hurt them hell no. Â I think thats the fine line I was talking about. Â Our disdain for them somewhat bleeds over to the "would they hurt my kids section". Â As far as taking a little one to a prison hell thats a tough pill right there. Â As a father I would hate for my daughters to get that image of me behind bars in their heads. Â When I got my contempt charge and had to do a small stint in county I instructed everyone not to write me/see me/ hell dont do anything. Tell my girls daddy is away for work. Â I had written several fake letters for them to read during the week as well. Comment Join Baller Alert.com

Eric Williams spoke to Gawker.TV, this is what he said.  What do you wish people knew about you?
I'm just misunderstood. I kept myself quiet and reserved in the first year of Basketball Wives. Its almost like okay how do they want to portray me, whether me personally care or not. I think we got into some male bashing, not quite, but it was damn near close. Advertisement  What do you think of the generally negative perception of the American athlete?
That's a bunch of crap. Guys don't make it to the [professional] level being an asshole. Everyone's got an opinion and everyone's entitled to his or her opinion. My thing was always to try to be as positive as I possibly can. Did I make mistakes? I'm not the only one out here who is a man in a hot position that commits some kind of mistake or adultery. Everyone is afraid of that word, adultery, but I'm not. Do you regret the mistakes you made?
I ain't the first and I ain't the last. I'm just what's going on right now. I will admit it though, I have had infidelities in my life. I did certain things and I reacted instinctively without thinking, that's what men do sometimes. Cheating is not new to me or anybody out there, it's juts relevant right now because of a show that became really popular in the black community. Sponsored  Do you think the editing made you look worse than you actually are?
I am nothing but passion. If people know what passion really looks like, and they can look at me. I'm not a part of the production; they don't come to me with what to do. Nowadays people only know what they see which is unfortunate. They're blind to that TV. I hear someone say you know on TV they perceive you to be a mean individual. I'm not here to start a fight, anymore. I was in the midst of a situation and I felt like we shouldn't have been on TV at all. Was it painful to have your marital problems aired in such a public way?
It happened, and it was what it was. But you've got people whispering in you ear, you're looking at like what's going to happen after [the show]. I made bad decisions in that infidelity happened. You learn from your mistakes, and then you grow and you move on. That's the only way I'm able to function. What are you really all about?
Making ideas that I come up with come to life. As far as recognition from the outside world, I'm not looking for it. Anything that I ever do, I always looking at it universally, always to benefit others. Even in the case of me portraying my infidelity â I still support Jennifer in everything she does. I support her in what she wants to do. She's the one who wanted to do this show. People don't really understand my personality. People are judging me based on a show that's a bunch of fabrications. My stuff is real, but if you build a story around an individual to make him a bad guy. That's what the masses of people are saying, that's what it's perceived. Advertisement  If the world hates me, I know the universe loves me. What do you have to say about the allegations that you have a child from a women who you cheated on your wife with?
It's funny how that stuff like that will break out when a show needs some more press. They just ironically had that break out to give it momentum. You have to understand the process to the game. Do your homework, there's information that'll prove it. I mean that's the thing, it's not for me to defend. I'm not here to defend my honor over some speculations, my situation is that show is the real situation. People are making a clown of it. Why would I think I need to give a proclamation to the world? That's the way they played it.

You'll Love    Bow Wow's Baby's Mama Speaks On Bow Wow's Suicidal Thoughts & New Baby Daughter Leave a Comment #DontShoot Report Bangin Candy Cash Money artist Bow Wowâs babyâs mother, Joie Chavis, has come forward to address his recent admission to contemplating suicide and discussed sharing a newborn with him. âHe would always talk to me. We became friends before anything. So he would always talk to me and I was straight to the point with him. I would always tell him âyou have fans, you have people who admire and look up to you.â âYou have a beautiful blessing on the way that you have to live for. You have so much to live for so donât think like that.â I was definitely always there for him to cope with whatever he was going through. And just letting him know, be that father that you didnât have to your daughter.â Earlier this week, Bow Wow wrote open letter crediting his daughter for giving him new motivation. âLet me start off by saying i love my fans. With out yall i wudda been left the game. For the past 3 years i been batteling life. Even thought about taking my own. I felt like as a kid i did everything and saw everything too fast which spoiled my adult years. I felt as if i had no purpose to live(Thinking selfishly) until god gave me the illest gift of my lifeâ  No lambo, no blk card nuffn ammounts to my lil girl. I waited so long to tell yall the truth because i was nervous on how yall would look at me. Yall know everyone makes a big deal out of everything i do. I wanted to be 1st n let yall know the real.  My lil girl is getting BIG fast. i love every minute of it. She inspires me to go harder. Even made me treat my mother better, its like it made me into a man over night. Never been a fan of posting pix of my daughter. Reason is because i want my boo boo to have everything i didnt. Want her to be able to cheerlead with her lil friends with out some a**hole sticking his camera all in my lil girl face.â We are glad things are looking up for Bow Weezy! bow bow hello dumb A$$â¦ keep your PERSONAL business PERSONALâ¦. go to court and put a GAG order on your childs mother!! thats pitiful to me how YOU BOTH are sharing so much public information on your childâ¦.and/relationship. if anything bow wow thats going to hurt your career not help. thanksâ¦â¦ (yes i know he isnt reading this) lol Who cares?

Until people realize that there is more than just a rational, straightforward cost-benefit analysis that goes into the decision to have unprotected sex, to get an abortion, or to give birth to a child knowing full-well that you canât feed and clothe the child without crossing your fingers and wishing for the best, there will be those who claim that poor black (and non-black mothers) are immoral and lacking in good judgement. Personally, I can think of concrete, worthwhile reasons to not get pregnant right now: I want to graduate with my bachelorâs degree in a few months and donât want the added stress of figuring out where I can access prenatal care; I want to attend graduate school for an MBA in the near future; I want to married before having any more children; I think that I can get a pretty great man to marry me, but the quality of the man I can get will necessarily decrease as my own âbaggageâ increases; I want to move around a bitâboth nationally and internationallyâfor the next five or six years and I would not be able to do that with a small child in tow. What reasons does a poor young woman in the hood or trailer park have to avoid getting pregnant? Sure, she could dream of a life outside of her poor surroundings, she can imagine getting married to a wonderful man and having kids with her husband. But what if no one tells her that this is the reality that she should aspire to, and furthermore, what if she doesnât think that realityâa great husband and kids, all living happily in the âburbsâwill ever be a reality for her? A poor woman with only a high school diploma or some college only has the option of dating, mating, and relating to men who are on the same level in life as she is. The men that this poor young woman is able to date probably lack job opportunities, donât have enough education to get a high-paying job, might possess a juvenile criminal record. These are the men available to her, so these are the men she dates. For a teenager or young women in her twenties, there are reasons why having a baby without a reliable partner seem feasible. By having a child when she is young, the chances that she and her baby will be in good health throughout the pregnancy are higher than if she were older, she also has an abundance of family members who are also relatively young to help her raise the baby. Women choose to bring children into the world in untenable situations because they are looking for someone to love, who will love them back. A young woman whose only dating options are thugs knows that these thugs donât love her, but if she has a baby then that baby will give her love. A baby will give her the chance to have something to be responsible for, a baby will be a chance to show how mature she is, a baby will give her something to do with herself other than the option of sitting around the house being lonely or laying up in bed with a thug. So what does she do? She makes the decision to have a baby. My pastor once told me that as Christians our first ministry is our home. We canât come to church to minister to anyone and our own home is a mess. To paraphrase him, there are too many church women spending an exorbitant amount of time in churchâattending every church meeting, chairing every church organization, throwing fifty-dollar offerings up on the altar in the hopes that Jesus will bring them a husbandâwhen their own daughters are out running the streets looking for someone to love them, to give them a hug and tell them they are beautiful. Well, if Mama is too busy in church to tell you she loves you and Daddy isnât around, that leaves the thugs. And the thugs will always tell you whatever they need to tell you to get you to do what they want you to do; but for girls with low enough self-esteem, they donât need to be told anything at allâthey imagine that providing sex will get a man to provide them with love. Girls who are trading sex for what they hope will be a return offering of companionship and love are wrong in their assumption, but they donât feel that other options are available to them. Is it reasonable to assume that poor women can be expected to forgo the pleasures of child-rearing, the love and companionship of a child, the sense of responsibility and maturity that rearing a child develops in a parent, when these same women donât see a middle-class lifestyle where children come after marriage as being an attainable reality? Bashing poor unwed mothers is fashionable and suits our cultural beliefs that personal failings are always the fault of the individual, that our personal failings have little to no relationship to the options available to the individual or the cultural milieu that creates those options. None of us makes choices in a vacuum. We all do a complex calculusâusing logic and emotionsâto make a decision. If we want poor women to stop having babies in less than ideal circumstances then we need to make the young men who are available for these women to date better partners, and we need to give these women reasons to wait to commence childbearing. In order for women to put marriage before motherhood, they will need good reasons that are clearly understandableâfrom their point of viewâfor doing so. Until those reasons materialize, you can expect the motherhood before marriage to continue.

One of Floyd Mayweatherâs baby mamas may have forgiven him for the violent incident that led to him going to jail, but another disturbance with another one of his child bearers may put him back there. 

The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports:
Las Vegas police last week responded to a 911 call made by a woman who said she was in a "verbal altercation" with the champion boxer.
After the argument , Mayweather fled with at least one of the unidentified victimâs personal possessions.
Police records show the incident happened about 2 a.m. Sept. 9 at 10059 Baystone St., near Southern Highlands, where the boxer lives.
Melissa Brim, the mother of Mayweatherâs daughter, lives at that address, according to public records.
Brim, 32, has had past violent run-ins with the boxer, including two incidents that resulted in Mayweather pleading guilty to two counts of domestic battery in 2002.
Officers went to the home, which is owned by a Mayweather company, PMG Sinclair LLC, and found no signs of physical violence, police spokeswoman Laura Meltzer said. A Mayweather associate later returned the victimâs possessions, and the victim declined to press charges, Meltzer said.
Itâs unclear whether the incident will affect Mayweatherâs probation.Â 
I know this guy can afford an anger management class, life coach, and has enough star power to book an appearance on Iyanla, Fix My Life. What is the problem.

Denise Richards Taking Care Of Charlie Sheenâs Twins After Baby Mama Goes ToÂ Rehab! Listen Live More From 99.5 WYCD Detroit's Best Country The still troubled Brooke Mueller has asked Charlie Sheenâs ex wife Denise Richards to care for her and twin boys, while she tries rehab for the 19th time. While Denise has been portrayed as somewhat of an airhead, she obviously the 41-year-old mom of three has a heart of gold and agreed to care for 3-year-old Bob & Max, along with her 3 children while Mueller is in rehab, As for why Charlie isnât caring for his own children â¦ Apparently he doesnât have time, because heâs shooting âAnger Management.â So Denise will care for Bob and Max for âan indefinite period of time.â Denise has been supporting Mueller through her drug battles and multiple rehab stints in recent years, and previously took care of Sheenâs boys while mum stayed at a wellness center to aid her recovery earlier this year.Â  Richards has two children of her own with Sheen, daughters Lola and Sam, and she adopted baby girl Eloise last year. The actors split in 2006 and Sheen went on to marry Mueller in 2008. They divorced in 2011. Denise Richards has steadfastly been supportive of Charlie, refusing to badmouth him during his own periods of trouble, which seems pretty admirable to me. Most exes would jump at the opportunity to kick an ex while they are down. Do you have a super great relationship with an ex that surprises everyone, including you?

All Rights Reserved. All Rights Reserved Powered by WordPress.com VIP 3 years ago An Orlando judge recently ruled in NBA star Chris BoshâsÂ (pictured left) favor, regarding child support payments. After being able to defend his claim that he does indeed live in Texas, rather than Florida, Bosh was able to side step paying baby mama,Â Allison Mathis (pictured)Â  a whopping $30,000 a month, according to the Miami Herald. SEE ALSO: Katt Williams: Iâm UNretired! The coupleâs child support battle has been going on for three years over their three-year-old daughter, Trinity (pictured below). Mathis, who lived with Bosh when he played for the Toronto Raptors, conceived their child with the help of fertility treatments. Since living together for two years and going their separate ways when Mathis was six months pregnant, it has been a nonstop bitter publicÂ feud between the exes. Mathis aired her business when she told the media about her job loss, saying that she had to go on welfare to apply for food stamps and wasÂ  facing foreclosure due to the âpaltryâ $2,600 monthly amount Bosh doles out for child support. Bosh, who got married last year to Adrienne Williams and who also has a 7-month-oldÂ son, fired back at Mathis for smearing his good name and implying that he is not a good provider for his child.Â  The Miami Heat power forward even threatened to sue Mathis for invading his privacy, when she released their pregnancy videotape to various media outlets. Bosh, whoÂ claims to have given Mathis $250,000 in 2010, said he pays for the childâs medical and dental insurance, which was not court mandated.Â  The 6â11âÂ ballerÂ also covers all preschool expenses and supplies and school extracurricular and developmentalÂ activities fees. With a college fund already set up for the child, Bosh alleges thatÂ he givesÂ Trinity plenty of emotional support as well. Meanwhile, as far as any child support increases for Mathis from her ex-$18-million-a-year man, according to Texas law, he is paying what the courts deem necessary and no adjustments to the child support order are necessary. Back in August, Bosh was grilled in court by Mathisâ attorney, Jane Carey, regarding his residency claim.Â  Even though Boshâs name was purged from the Texas voting lists and he owns a $12.5 Miami Beach home, he still was able to claim Texas as his state of residency. The presiding judge, Orange County Circuit Courtâs Robert Evans, says that he based his decision to allow Bosh to claim Texas as his primary home because his income tax filings were sent to the IRS from Texas. Go figure! Sound off!

															Why you shouldnât date a âbaby mamaâ									 Baby Mamas are vulnerable Comments  Have you ever wondered why there are so many single mothers lately? Well, donât stretch your mind so hard because itâs a no brainer. The answer is simple - modernity. Modernity came at quite a cost - it has destroyed the moral fabric of love and then it brought about the whole notion of equality. Then all of a sudden women started believing that they could be men. Believing that they could go through raising a child without a father, women started acting like the men in relationships. Thus the reason behind many breakups - everyone wants to take charge. We now have children who go to school confused. They do not know what to say when their friends ask about âDaddyâ because they have someone new to call âUncleâ every other month. So, it was easy when a friend came asking if he should date a woman with a child. My answer was a plain, âNoâ and I have my reasons.You will always be number two Men will always be men and part of that includes you not playing second fiddle. But dating someone with a kid means that you will always be number two. Number one will always be the babyâs father, leaving you as an option. She might still be crazy about the baby daddy Women are very emotional creatures who attach a lot of sentiments to most things they do. So, despite the fact that she is not with the baby daddy doesnât mean she doesnât think about him every time she looks at the child. In most cases, she might even be trying to patch things up with him on the side. The drama  All women have drama but the ones with kids take it to another level. There will always be times when she gets into fights with the baby daddy because he doesnât care and throw all that baggage on you. Then have you thought about the fact that the reason they are not together is because there is something crazy about this woman? Her craziness is either the reason why the guy ran away or why she decided to get pregnant with a man who has no guts to even raise his child. If you accept to be with such a woman, then that means you have agreed to be crazy as well. The heap on your plate Dating a woman with a child means you are dating two people at once. First you have to ensure that the child likes you because that is the way to the womanâs heart. There are certain things that not even love can bury like the fact that you will always miss that joy of experiencing your child coming into the world. With this kid, you will always have a fake bond because it is not yours. And the trying times will come when the baby puts a damper on your plans of hanging with the boys. In case the child has a cold, you will rush to the doctor, missing out on your precious night with the guys. If there is any type of woman that is easy to nail, then a baby mama is on top of that list. They are very vulnerable to any man they see, hoping he would become a father-figure. They are willing to try out the next best option on the pretext that âI am doing this for my childâ. But the real truth is that they are afraid of being alone, afraid of raising the child on their own. So, if you are even thinking along those lines, sober up; this is not what you want.This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.

Me, My Boyfriend and His "Baby Mama"...
 111 comments: Not every baby mama has drama. This one has Jesus! 
I am at a very young age and very head over heels with my boyfriend and I have tried everything in my power to make things work for all of us me, him and his baby mama but I do not know where i am going wrong 1stly I tried making it clear to my boyfriend that yes he is someone elses baby daddy but i asked for him to set boundries things like asking her not to call at akward hours of the night asking him to come over sonce we are in the same institution, i tried making small talk wit the baby mama asking about the child all my attempemts have failed until she had an outburst telling me to leave her alone and that we must leave her child out of our realtionship and that my boyfriend is forcing matters by trying to involve me in the childs life and so on and i also had my far share of outbursts because i fail to understand how i could possibly create a wprking relationship if she keeps finding fault in all my efforts
 
GirlonFire, thank you for taking the time to read and comment. Let me share some things with you to help. First, people in their mid 30's like myself have a tough time with dealing with the whole dynamic of children outside of a relationship. And I will be honest with you: it takes a high level of maturity to make a relationship like this work, and that's men and women included. Few people have the level of maturity that it takes to successfully manage this very complicated family structure. I'm not saying this to discourage you but to give you perspective. So if you decide that your love for your boyfriend is strong and you want to hang in there with this relationship, then you must be prepared to roll up your sleeves and keep working at it. Based on what you've told me, there will be many more painfully disappointing days between you, the baby mama and your BF because it sounds like there's still some issues between them that have nothing to do with you. If you want to know how difficult this may be for his baby mama, imagine that you are her. As much as you love your BF, you have his child but now the two of you are broken up. There's anger, hurt, frustration, jealousy when you see him moving on with another woman while you're the one with his child, etc. At this point, rather than telling you what to do as "the girlfriend" in this situation, I want to tell you what to do so as not to become "the baby mama".  The truth of the matter is that if you decide to have a baby with your bf (planned or unplanned)this will create an even more tense situation between all of you because now you feel as if your child with him takes priority and his first baby mama feels the same way. My advice? If you're having unprotected sex with your boyfriend, stop. And if you really want to take it to the level it needs to be, abstain completely if you aren't already. You're getting a courtside view of what happens when "romantic love" goes bad and there's a child involved. Don't ignore what you're seeing and hearing. Lastly, you are a girlfriend, not a wife. I'm not saying this to insult you but as a reminder. A lot of what you're trying to do and manage should rest on a wife's shoulders, not yours. There's no covenant of marriage involved so why are you investing in your relationship as if you're already married? My suggestion? Give ALL of them some space! You are young. You do not have children. Give your boyfriend and his baby mama their business back. They have a lot to figure out as parents that has absolutely nothing to do with you. In the meantime, you're focused on YOUR goals, your passions, and hopefully, your relationship with God. And it may be that as you take a step back and allow them to do things the way that they want to that you find a love that you can call your own that doesn't make you feel like you have to referee between two people or feel disrespected by another woman. Blessings to you sis and feel free to stay connected!
 
Hi Melissa.I am actually in the same situation but a little different. This might be long but i really need advice and help.So, first of all. My boyfriend has a 6 year old daughter with a girl he grew up with. My boyfriend told me a whole lot about there past together. The went to the same church, they even went out together when they were kids and years later got back together and only 7 months later had a baby together. I feel like I am just another girlfriend is his families eyes because his mother still has family photos of her in them, also photos of her giving birth in the hospital ect. And it bothers me and makes me feel left out and veru uncomfortable. My boyfriends mother does know how I feel about the photos being up but she really does not care about how I feel. They still envite her to family events and everything. Its just really hard for me to handle all of this from knowing about my boyfrends past with the baby mama to the family not accepting me like they do the baby mama. For examply, today, my boyfriends grandmother called and said she will be having his daughter with her so the 3 of them should go get dinner. The grandmother didnt even bother to envite me to go with them, so I feel very much left out, and here I am sitting at home looking for some advice. This maybe be alittle much but I also have to mention that My boyfriend told me to get an abortion when i found out i was pregnant, but when his baby mama got pregnant he was all for having a child with her, so that hurts me. Anyway, I am back and forth about my feelings about continuing my relationship with my boyfriend because of all this. I need help

Evana, thank you so much for taking the time to visit my blog. I want to give you some advice that will help you to at least start thinking a little differently about this situation.First, I want to tell you that in our society, the position of "girlfriend" has become way more than it should have ever been. What I mean is girlfriends easily drift in and out of the "wifey" title and end up shouldering wifely duties. This is great for a man because he gets all of these benefits at a steep discount. He doesn't have to make a legally binding commitment to you and ne doesn't have to clearly define your role in his life as well as his responsibilities to you because after all, "y'all aint married". But the reality is that it hurts to give your all to a man and to a relationship all to be treated like the fifth wheel when it comes to his family and his child.I'm going to give you some hard truths but trust that it's coming from a woman who lived it: You feel like the fifth wheel because you ARE the fifth wheel. Your boyfriend already has a family: his parents,child and baby mama. This is the family that HE created and so far, it looks like it's the only family he's interested in maintaining. It's not your job to come in and tell him, or his mama, or his baby mama that you deserve to have a place of respect. That place should have already been prepared for you, you feel me?So that's where you need to start from. Start from the moment you read this reply and think about YOU for a change. It's time you looked out for YOUR best interests, and not everyone else's because trust me, whether you stay or go, everyone else is going to continue to do business as usual the way they want to. 
 
continued..So the question is, what are YOU going to do? What do YOU deserve? And how are YOU going to protect your heart so as not to be hurt anymore in this situation or a future relationship?First thing you need to do is be a girlfriend. Do you want to know what that means? Well, girlfriends have their own lives, their own interests and their own plans. They spend time with boyfriends, but at the same time, they have their own friends that they hang out with. They have their own homes. They pay their own bills. They have their own goals and dreams that they're achieving in life. Girlfriends also realize that there's no ring on their finger that says that if another man comes along that can respect her and love her the way she deserves that she can't move on with him. Is it wrong to think this way? It only seems that way because girlfriends have been conditioned to behave like wives but receive the respect of girlfriends. Your boyfriend's mom isn't disrespecting you- her son is. She's treating you like a girlfriend because her son hasn't made you his wife. Now let me caution you: you may think that having his baby will even the playing field between you and his baby mama but do NOT play with your seed that way. Children deserve to be born into a loving home, not a home where mama is trying to one-up a baby mama and possibly end up being a baby mama herself. So, if you're having unprotected sex with your boyfriend and you're not on birth control, you need to stop. Please don't bring an innocent child into the world because you have the need to feel important to your boyfriend. A baby will not make you more significant to him. Trust me on this. I have two of my baby daddy's three children. The other one is the oldest. Having his children does not guarantee you his heart so don't play that game.It's time for you to think like a grown woman and take responsibility for your life. Is this REALLY how you want to live? Is this really the kind of relationship you want? Can you trust and believe that there is a man out here that knows a good woman when he sees her and has made his life ready for her? Those are the sorts of things you need to think about instead of how to get your boyfriend's mom to replace her family photos. :)Feel free to subscribe to my personal facebook page https://www.facebook.com/MLewis001. Stay in touch and let me know how things are going. Remain blessed and know that God is here to help you through anything you may be facing. Continue to pray to Him and seek Him for direction. I'm thankful He led you to my blog and He will continue to guide you every step of the way.
 
Hey Melissa, I know this post is old but i really need your advice and opinion. Ive been with my man for a year now, i am 23 years old and he is 30, before getting together he was in an 8 years relationship with his baby mother and they had 3 kids together. When we first got together the baby mother did everything to try to make me run the opposite directions, from calling my phone private, showing up to his house acting crazy, trying to break into his house just because i was there, trying to fight me numerous times, and keying my car. Through all this i stayed by his side because i just felt that she was hurt and that could be the only explanation for her actions. In the beginning she would not allow him to see his kids, tried to take him to court, and would just act very crazy (again i get she was hurt). Fast forward months later she finally started to come around allowing her children to come over again and developing a little bit of a friendship with him. Well fast forward a few more months, now she calls him random times of the night, he doesnt really talk to her much around me, she picks him up while im at work, she has told him through text in the past she still has feelings for him even though she is suppose to have a man now but he is in jail because of her, and i even found out he stayed the night at her house and didnt tell me. None of this was happening when her man was not in jail. It makes me jealous that when she wants to see him or the times they talk (never around me) are always secretive or they use the kids as what feels to me as an excuse. I love this man but am i playing myself because things just dont feel right anymore...He says im just being insecure and immature. what do you think?

RespectUrself, props to you for taking the time to reach out with your question. I'm going to keep it real with u if u will allow me to. First, it concerns me that u are with a man that is 30. But beyond that, u are with a man who has 3 children from a long term relationship. As a "babymama", let me tell u that a woman doesn't just have 3 children by the same man if she doesn't believe that relationship will be permanent. For him to turn around and be with u after 8 yrs and 3 kids felt like a slap in her face. One major mistake that we women make when getting involved with a man is only thinking about ourselves and our man and not the other women and children that our man may have hurt. I'm going to try to spare u 10 yrs worth of pain and foolish decisions real quick. Your bf and his children's mother have unfinished emotional business. He has three children to raise, whether he has a gf or not and those children have a mom.
 
Continued...As harsh as this is going to sound, u are not the priority in this situation. But thats not your fault. It's his fault for bringing u into a situation he hasn't handled properly but it is your fault for staying and tolerating it. At 23, u should be starting graduate school or climbing the corporate ladder or opening your own business. Don't allow this man to waste your productive years. You must take the reigns of your life and pursue your goals and dreams. This is no way for a strong and beautiful woman to live: drama, cars keyed and sneaking behind your back. No mam. Somewhere there's a guy who knows how to honor u and u don't have to feel like you are last on his list..and if I were u, I wouldn't rest until I found him nor would I settle for less. Follow me on facebook: facebook.com/MLewis001. Blessings to you!
 
My situation is so much harder bcus I've been with this guy since I was 16. I'm 20 now. During our relationship he was unfaithful as most young guys are. Anyway about a year into our relationship he broke up with me to be with another chick, not soon after that did I find out she was pregnant. They were together less then 4 months when this happened. The night he told me she was pregnant he also sent me a long text saying that he wanted to get back with me and marry me yada yada ya...I agreed...and when I tell you that this is the HARDEST thing in the world for me. I mean 2011-2012 have been such a rollercoaster. After the baby was born he left me again so that they could be a "family" and it just never works out for them and he comes right back to me. Bt his babymom is soo disrespectful and just spiteful. She tries to tell me that if he and I move in together. He won't be able to see his son. We argue everytime we speak. Bt what hurts the most is the family aspect. For example I'm not allowed at his house at all because his mother doesn't want both us coming there. His mother or family doesn't even know me barely. He graduates from school on Friday and I can't even go. That hurts so much. I haven't even met his son. I feel like a complete outsider. I mean after dating someone for 4 years things should be different. And still after all this I still think he misses her recently because he seems kinda off. Idk maybe I'm just paranoid. It's so hard to just leave bcus hes a good guy that made a mistake. I just don't think he handles is the right way. I feel like she make SHE & her son the main focus instead of their SON being the main focus.

Benny, thank u for leaving your comment, I'm going to be very straight forward with you not to offend you, but to help you. The problem with many women is that we often refuse ti acknowledge the common denominator between what we are going through and what the next woman is or has gone through. Your circumstances may have different details than the other women who have commented but you all have the same core issue. Understand something.  Going out and making a baby with another woman isn't just a "mistake". Leaving you to go be a family with her isn't just a mistake. Being unable to attend his graduation isn't a mistake. His family having no respect for you isn't a mistake. He has painted a clear picture of his disrespect for u with his actions. But the problem is you keep falling for his words,  which are music to your ears. But his words unfortunately are nothing more than beautiful lies that have kept YOU hangin on while he's clearly moved on. There are two conversations going on from this man: what he says and what he DOES.  The question is "which voice will u continue to believe"? For your own sanity and dignity, it's time to believe what he's been doing, not what he's been saying.

Hey,I just came across this blog. Reading it gave me some insight. Things I already do. First my boyfriend and I are both in our 30's, we have both been married for over 7 yrs, we both have children from those marriages. My boyfriend pretty much stays away from my ex, and I stay out of things with his ex. My children live with us, his daughter lives primarily with her mother. Now we both support choices and make choices together involving ex's and children. My boyfriends daughter wants to be with us, but remains with her mom.I think our relationship works, because we can each be in our relationship and "family" but we both see things as we would if we were in our ex's shoes. He dislikes my ex and I really dislike his, some of his actions leave me feeling insecure when it comes to his ex. He married her because she got pregnant. He has no interest in marrying me, and thats ok, ive done it and honestly its much simpler being the girlfriend than the wifey. Everything is living life taking experiences learning from them and using them when you need to, or adjusting and working on things that need work, like any "normal" family relationships.Im always up for advice or insight. But the main reason I am commenting is because I really want to let these girls know these relationships involving children aren't easy, and take a lot of strength and work. In some cases more work than you think you have energy for. But I have found its worth it in the end. Atleast for me.
 
I have been the child in that type of situation so I understand a part of it, and my now boyfriend is the first guy I've been with that has a baby,  we've been together for almost 2 yrs, his baby will be 3 this year.. and I have only seen his baby mama, she doesn't want to meet me and i don't, I don't want to take over I Just want her to know that and to try and be in good terms. Also they talk a lot texting about random things only rarely about the baby plus she is now asking to borrow money and he just gives in. Right now we are trying to save money for a house and this borrowing money and talking at 2am about a concert or texting about videogames and him going over  here me watching the baby all week staying at the er for 4 hrs cuz the poor baby is sick and still not meeting the baby mama bothers me

Hey Melissa. My name is Brandi. I was in a similar situation. I was dating this guy for nearly a year. He has a 12 yr ol daughter with his baby's mama. He has had his daughter since she was a few mths old. She has never lived with the baby mama. He would never let me meet his daughter or visit his home. I only visited once in a years time & it was breifly. His babys mama still comes around. When she is visiting his home.. Well he still lives with his parents so i should say the parents home. I always asked him were they still an item. He would always tell me no. He says to me he hasnt been in a relationship with his baby mama in 10 yrs. Well ab a mth ago the baby mama called my phone from his phone at 3am asking me what was going on with me & her childs father. I told her everything. She went thru his phone & saw previos text msga and pics that he & i shared. She was upset & so was i. She told me that they had bn back together for 2 mths when he was just with me thenight before. He denied me of course. Days later she continued to call me private asking me where do he & i stand! He later called & apologized for putting me in his drama. I eventually got my number changed. They now live together. But still to this day whenever he sees me. He tells me how much he misses me & hes sorry. He still wants to continue a sex life with me. I love him. I am really hurt by this situation and i dont know what to do. Can you help me please!!???!!
 
Kayla and shaniab, for the sake of discussion, I'm gonna be "babymama"that neither of you are having a face to face conversation with:Dear gf, I just want you to know that if you're mad at me or trying to check me in any way, you are wasting your time. Your man, my babydaddy is thebone leaving the gate open and I'm just walking through it. Sure you could say that I shouldn't be walking through it but I guess all the locksmiths should retire because there's no need to lock up anything and keep it safe. Your relationship with your man is between yall, not me. And my relationship with him is our business. If you have a problem with our relationship, take that up with HIM because trust, he aint doing, saying or being anywhere he don't wanna be. One day we'll both get tired of being played by the same man but until that day comes, realize we are both, you and I, being played. It's up to you and me to decide when we're done. Sincerely, -Your Man's Babymama
 
Really happy to have found this thread without an angry, ignorant audience bashing the women in this position. I hope you will respond because i would value your advice. My boyfriend and i have bren togethet almost three years. He has a daughter by a woman who lied about birth control and we have a 4 month old son. He is a good father, respectful and considerate of my position in all this, wants to marry me and tries to deal with his daughters mom the best he can. Hes a god man. I love him and his daughter and i even get along great. Yet still...i just can't shake thede feelings. The mother is a...challenge to say the least but t I don't know if id feel any different if she weren't. Im resentful of the time, money and attention his other child takes. I try to think of us all as our own unit...i just can't. I know its not  her fault shes here, im careful to not show her any tension or resentment, and the three of us do a lot together but...It was a challenge for me having my firstborn with someone who had already done it w someone else and now I just feel miserably stuck. I thought it would get better but its actually gotten worse. If i walk away, i deprive our son of his father and me of a relationship I love except for this one aspect. If i stay, im putting myself through emotional hell. Will it get better, can i change, should i walk. I want to support him in their relationship, to be a friend and good influence to his daughter, but it kills me. I want a happy family. I thought i could do this...i dont think so any more and its so painful either way. Is there any answer here.
 
I really enjoyed reading this blog post and the comments because I felt as though every situation was providing very real insight into this phenomenon.  I am a 24 year old woman and I have a 28 year old boyfriend.  We've been together for 3 years.  He has no kids and no obligations to other women.  I purposely DO NOT and have NEVER dated a man with children from previous relationships because I took the time to get to know myself, my wants, and my needs.  I am young and I have no use for a man with extra baggage, as I am also not trying to create any for myself.  I am doing what a young, beautiful, and strong woman should be doing at this age.  I am currently working two jobs, paying my own bills, and starting my own company.  I don't have time for men with children, as I don't have time for any myself at this point.  I truly feel for the women who have commented on this blog that are in their own dramatic situations with their significant others and a babymama.  Some of you ladies have been blessed with not having children of your own with the person, so it may be a bit easier for you to assess your worth and value and get out of a bad situation before it gets worst.  Some of you, unfortunately, have become babymama #2 and are now dealing with the effects of that.  As women, if we want men to respect us, we have to respect ourselves and show them we are worth it.  I think it's very hard, especially if you are under 30 years old, to deal with babymama drama.  If you choose to start dating at 40 years old, then having a man with kids is somewhat expected, if you are dating within your age range.  In your 20's, that shouldn't even be on your agenda.  You should be shooting for the stars instead of worrying about your man and what he's doing with his babymama.  Most men, not all men, have a blurred perception of relationships with women after already having a babymama.  They now have a babymama and a girlfriend (who, may also be a babymama) and they feel sexually entitled to both.  The babymama because they've already been intimate enough to have a child together, and the girlfriend because that's his current chick.  I knew from when I started dating men in general that that wasn't how I wanted to live my life.  So, in the past when I have met different men, if they mention anything about having a child I automatically put them in the friend zone.  Because I'm choosing not to deal with that.  You also have to think about finances as well.  As one of the other women on this blog commented, when you have a man who has outside obigations, things like saving for a house, car, wedding, etc. become extremely difficult.  Especially if the babymama is spiteful and does the typical "I'ma suck every penny out this fool" move.  That's another thing I'm not dealing with.  I want at least 3 kids, so I'm not against having them at all.  But I am against being thrown into a situation with kids if I'm not ready for that.  So, my point is, if you're absolutely okay with dealing with this kind of life, then by all means, do you.  But if you're like me and have dreams of success that require "no-baggage" situations, then you need to smarten up and pick the man that you know can live up to that.  Good luck, ladies!
 
Hello Melissa,I been dating my boyfriend for almost 1 year this coming Sept. When we meet he already had a son and his baby momma was expecting the second one. I have yet to meet either of them. My boyfriend and I got very serious very quick and now we are living together. We definitely have weeding plans in the future. As of now we are very happy except with the children situation. The mother does not let him see the kids unless she or her mother are around. He has to drive to go see them at her house or there has been a few times when she drives to his mothers home.I have always been bothered that she does not let him take the kids because that means I cant meet them until she lets him take them. Now I'm more bothered because when she takes the kids to his family home his whole family is there because they want to see the kids and when she goes she takes her parents as well so I feel like its a family get together and Im not included. It makes me feel left out. When in reality Im already part his family. The only reason why I am still left out is because of her. To my knowledge she has never said anything about me but she is clearly doing everything in her power to keep me away from her children.They are currently trying to settle this in court but who knows when that ends. I tried to keep a brave face but there are times when I cant help it and I tell my bf how I truly feel. I know its a complicated situation for him but if we are as serious as we are I feel like I deserve to know his children. Im not just a typical chick who is going to leave in the next couple of months. What would you suggest I do? Should I try to reach out to the baby momma? Should I just bite my tongued and pretend like everything is okay? HELP!!!
 
Hello Melissa,                                                                                                                                             I Found your blog to be quiet interesting. I am in a difficult situation being that I am 20 years old, I've been dating my boyfriend whom is 25 for six months. I met his child from his previous relationship about a month ago he now wants to bring him around me much more.He has clearly told me has nothing to do with the mother of his child anymore and I believe so, but should I be wrong for wanting to meet her?

Hey sweetheart,  Just like the other women commenting. I'm going through a tuff time with my boyfriendwho means the world to me and the mother of his child. Don't get me wrong I don't really care for how she go about things but that's not my place. we recently just fell out about her and his child. well for starters we agreed to get his daughter on the weekend because that's his off days. so we got her two weekends ago. Sunday night comes for BM (baby mother)  to get her child and she don't. he tells me we keeping her for a week . I'm like how we gone do that when we both work in the day . my schedule changes every day . Well he has a set schedule 1 to 10 pm.. So the first week I just said ok. I had my mother watch her until I got off work . She told me okay but she really didn't want to because it wasn't her grandchild and because of all the problems I been telling her about I been having with his BM. But she did so I'm thankful. so the weekend comes up again, time for the BM to pick up the child and she doesn't once again. My boyfriend tells me we keeping her another week because I don't feel like arguing with her about getting his daughter. The BM told him she need a break from her child and life so he better find a way.  Now don't get me wrong I love his daughter but when we get her she's always with me and he never has her. so I got her the whole time. I ask him did he see how I feel about getting her or seeing I had something to do since she's always with me. He told me no ,he figures since I got his then it should be ok. The first week was hard enough. I dropped days I couldn't get my mom to watch her. Then he don't want me to take his daughter to many places without his okay first. so when I got we in the house most of the time .  who wants to sit the house 24/7 ? I don't have no kids so why am I being the mother 24/7 ? They don't want me whooping her or disciplining her. so when she acts out or run off they don't want me doing nothing. she finally comes gets  two weeks later.  I tried sitting down talking to him about how I feel but.instead of understanding my point of view . He rushes to say you don't have to get my daughter no more if you don't want to be around her just say that. I didn't say none that. I told I should have to drop what I'm doing to please your BM . I don't stop what doing to rush home to get her daughter from her when its not my child. He like why not ? I said because that's not my daughter at the end of the day. And I don't to have jump through hoops for her. You have my back on how I feel. We argued and nothing was resolved. I don't what to do and it hurts. I cry myself to sleep ay night because I feel so alone.
 
Hello Melissa...I am in need of your help. My boyfriend and I are both in our 30's. I have children from a long term relationship as does he. He has been seperated for 5 years from his wife (not divorced yet). His ex will not allow me to be around her children even though he has them in his fulltime care. He abides by her rules begrudgingly but he still abides by this rule. He is scared of her. Most people are. She's a bully. I have done what she has asked. I had a sitdown meeting with her at her request before I met the kids. That was months ago. I pose no threat to the children. I don't smoke, drink, drugs, swear. She is quite obviously jealous and threatened by me but how long is too long to endure this for? We both have our kids fulltime and seeing eachother is almost impossible because of her controlling attitude. Should I stay or should I go? I must add...I do love him very much. He is the most wonderful man I have ever met and meets every need I have but living ten minutes away from him and not being able to embrace him when I want is almost unbearable. I'm exhausted. I need more from him and when I tell him I'm fed up with his ex's controlling ways, he clams up or says he's scared of her turning the kids against him...and she would...she has already started. Its awful for the kids. What do I do?
 
hey im a man and I have a question. so me and my girl started dating 3 years back. long story short I was lying to her about sleeping with the mother of my child.. so me and my girl now met in china and my baby momma lived in America.. when I was in china id mess with my girl now ad when I was in America id sleep with my daughters mom..well things happened and the girl who im with found out.. we weren't bf and gf yet but I told her that I liked her and that I was sorry and that id never to it again..since then we have been together going on 7 months.. my gf now feels that I shoulnt talk to my baby momma unless its only about my daughters wants and I agreed up unto a point...heres my question if im at my daughters graduation or sporting event should I ignore my baby momma if she asks me a question like " so your daughter looks cute in her cap and gown or if she asks me if I like an outfit she has on"... should I ignore her (my baby momma) or answer it... my gf now feels that all I should be able to say is hi... absolutely no chatting about my daughter or its disrespectful to her and means I don't care about her feelings or don't love her... another thing I went to the graduation and took a pic with everyone that came to the graduation. some of her family and some of my family were in it as well as my daughters mother and I but not together in the pic, I didn't think of it as being a family pic I seen it as everyone that came out its just a pic my girl says its a family pic and even though its my daughters graduation I shouldn't have stayed in it because my baby momma was in the same picture.... I need some advice on what to do how to make her feel more secure... I know she feels pain and doesn't like my baby momma because I was sleeping with them without them knowing.. what can I do? advice.. if you need any more info let me know
 
Madmilk, thanks for stopping by. I'm going to be straight with you. Here's my question: why did you feel the need to introduce bmama#1 as the one who lied about birth control? She may have, but did your man skip sex ed class? Lol! Here's something I want you to consider. Women are constantly tearing each other down. Why continue to feed the negative energy? Liar or not, she gave your man his first child which he both loves and claims. The only difference between you and her is a breakup. If your man broke up with you, yall would be in the exact same shoes. When you have a chance, go back and read my post called What's A Man To Do?. In it, I said something key: all of you are family.  Your man made a family when he made a bahy with the both of you. Do families always see eye to eye? No. But at the end of the day, this is the only family your children will know. They will always have siblings with a different mommy and one day, yall are going to have to explain this to them. You're being selfish right now. I'm not condemning you or criticizing you for it, but I'm being the big sis who will keep it real. You could get bogged down in the petty things or you could begin to ask yourself what type of family do you want your children to have and do your part to build it. That may mean praying for bmama#1, making sure you're lendingba hand to her becausevat the end of the day, women hold it all down and just want to take care of their babies. It may mean deciding to stop comparing yourself to her in your mind, finding fault and comparing yourself to her. Raising a child ain't easy. You both should show mutual respect for that alone. Never let a man cause you to tear another woman down. It was a woman in the hospital with you, telling you when to push. A woman showed you how to swaddle a baby, treat a cold, find a deal on clothes and pampers. Show love and it will come back. Any man worth his salt wants a woman who can respect herself and others, especially when "other" has his child. Blessings to you. Keep in touch! -Mel
 
Hey Melissa,  I need some advice I have a boyfriend that iI known  for 6 years nd we been been dating for almost 4 months nd he has a 8 month old baby by his ex baby mom who he can't stand cuz of how she treated him. But im left wondering why he just doesn't want to go back with her, I mean like they have a family together who doesn't want nothing more than that?, but at times I feel irrelevant to his family cuz of his ex and his son. Im also trying to cope with the fact his ex is going to be in his life basically forever or have a bonded life because of their son. So I just don't see why he just wont get back with his ex and get his family back together 
 
Hi Melissa, I'm the girl dating my junior high sweetheart. Going into this I knew I could handle it. The girl ended up prego before we got back together. What's done is done. Everything was fine until the daughter arrived.... Long story short he went and took family portraits with her and the baby. Not "we share the baby" type poses, poses that indicate "we are a family". We are now having problems . 
 
Continue from my previous post ... I'm really pissed at him because there couldve been different ways of posing in the pictures as opposed to thinking it was ok to go and act like a couple. I asked him why he didn't ask how I felt about it and he had no answer. He then lied and said he forgot to tell me then later said he didn't forget he just knew how I was going to react, which means he did what he wanted knowing I'd be upset later. I'm more upset about how he handle this. He simply couldve said hey we want to get pictures done how do you feel about that? ... There are also other issues like the mother hanging around while he's doing his daughter daddy time. She breastfeeding but I know there is a window in which infants can be left for 2-3 hours with pumped milk.Why is he allowing all of this to happen??? He still claims he loves me and wants to be with me and he's making mistakes but not on purpose etc I don't think I'm over reacting because he's been lying, omitting info and just simply not asking how I feel about things or keeping me in the loop of things. I feel like if he wants me there like he says he would let me know what's going on and no not tell me your every move type thing but tell me something instead of absolutely nothing! I'm afraid that when I get there there's going to be more trouble so I'm preparing myself for the best and worst and trying to keep a positive attitude and support him. I'm uprooting my life in Cali to move across stage to be with him in 3.5 weeks, this incident along with others just happened and his daughter is about 2 weeks old so I know everything is still very new. I understand that and I'm trying to find a way to understand these other things going on without getting upset but geeze after I looked at the pics it was a huge slap across my face. Please help me with all the advice you can. Also his based on him and other ppl the BM was friggin nuts! The first week he got caught up in the fact that she was "acting right" and now that he is trying to change a few of these bad habits he has started she is now wanting to go to court, cause arguments over things that have nothing to do with the baby etc. he was pretty much doing everything she wanted him to do. Spent entire days at her house with the baby, pictures, hanging around each other when the mom could've left baby with dad.... So she's made it clear that she is trying to create this imaginary relationship with him and he is only adding to it because he is trying to "keep the peace" with her... I have a problem with that. So please please help me clarify things and restore my confidence in going into this situation. 
 
Latasha, let be straight with you. Your bf is double minded and he has no idea what he wants or where he truly wants to be. Secondly, it is an incredibly foolish move to make on your part to uproot your life for a man that is as torn and conflicted as your bf. If there's any way possible, don't move. Wait.  Your bf has a brand new baby. Emotions are running high. He probably is considering the possibility of trying to make a family with his bmama. Most men who were raised right do. And bmama just had a baby which leaves her feeling emotional, hormonal and wanting support. My advice? Give your bf space. You deserve a man that's 100% committed to you and you already know by his actions and the fact that he feels the need to lie to you that it's something he can't do right now. For future reference, I'd never involve myself with a man who just had a baby with someone or had small children. Fact is, lines often get blurred between bdaddies and bmamas and sometimes, they can still be involved sexually, even several years afterva break up. The person you need to look out for is YOU right now because your bf's first responsibility is to his child, not you. And you cannot dictate how he should go about the task of being father and co parenting with bmama. The two of them ARE in a relationship and it's up to them to figure out how things will go and it's  up to your bf to set appropriate boundaries with his bmama so that he can truly move on to a new relationship which is hopefully with you. But by the looks of things, that day is a long way off and if you don't heed the warnings and red flags now, you stand to be in for a tremendous amount of hurt and disappointment.   Keep me updated sis! -Mel
 
Chris Reaves, thank you so much for visiting and commenting! I appreciate the male perspective.  Here's my advice regarding your situation: be completely honest with your gf. Parent to parent, you and I know how incredibly unrealistic it is to attempt to control every family function that involves your daughter and her mom, so don't try. It's important to reassure your bf and build trust but don't set yourself up for failure to the point you end up having to oie because you agree to terms that are unreasonable. Your first loyalty should be to your CHILD, not your gf or even your daughter's mom. Establish clear boundaries with both women. Your gf needs to know what she has absolutely no say over and so does your daughter's mom. Every decision you make should take your daughter into consideration first, and no one else. If your daughter wants pictures of her parents together, she should be allowed to have them for her own collection of momentos. Likewise, let your gf know where she stands with you. She cannot control or manipulate you, but that the two you will work together to build a bond and establish trust that doesn't directly or indirectly require you to neglect your daughter in any way. I know it's not an easy road but there are three women waiting on you to take a stand, be the hero and give clear leadership by setting appropriate boundaries.  I have every confidence that you can do it! Be sure to check back in with me to let me know how things are progressing. -Mel
 
Mel, Thanks for the advice. Unfortunately I only have 3.5 weeks before scheduled to leave. I've ready broke my lease etc etc so even with your advice I will still be making the move. This is where my mindset is... I realize the situation and risks I'm taking, this man is worth it to me. The place I'm moving is a place I've always wanted to be anyway for career advancement. So yes I'm uprooting for him but also myself.  I also have my plans to take care of myself whether this works out or not.I also know the the first 3 months of the child being here is crucial between the parents and I actually do want to be there to see how they interact, how he handles things (in person as opposed to being so far away while he goes thru this). Heart ache may be a possibility but that's not something I'm a stranger to at all. I have set a certain time frame for myself to dive in and take the risks. If I can't seem to adjust or he can't by my "deadline" then I will make the choice to move forward without him. I know I shouldn't set "time frames" or "guidelines" although I've learned that this method works for me, maybe not you or others but it does for me, I look at it as more of a soft guideline to try and make this work but to also protect myself... Hopefully that makes sense  but I will definitely "favorite" this blog and keep you updated! Thanks so much. Also take no offense that I am going against your advice, I'm taking your advice and applying it in bits and pieces to my particular situation which helps so much! 
 
Latasha, I take mo offense whatsoever but zI will say this for future reference: never make a life altering decision absent of prayer and godly counsel. Most of us, self included, seek advice after we set things in motion. Essentially our minds are made up and we're looking for an amen corner. I don't know how old you are but I suspect I'm a couple years older. One thing I've learned is that it's never too late to change your mind and make a difficult, but wiser choice. Based on your response, you seem to already have an idea of how things can go with your bf and are prepared either way. I wish you all the best in everything you set out to do. Many blessings to your sis! -Mel
 
Oh yes sis The Lord is my everything. I confide in him, thank him and serve him. He's my strength. Thanks again and God Bless 
 
Jasmine, thank you for your comnent and your patience!  I'd have to answer your question with a question: why do you want to meet her? It would have been nice if your bf had facilitated a meeting between you two, but since he hasn't,  don't stress it. She may not be ready to meet gf right now but is ok with their child being around you for the sake of quality time with daddy. Try not to wear your feelings on your sleeve because if you do, they will surely be hurt. Your bf's relationship with you, his child, and his bmama are three separate entities. As long as he's treating you right, taking good care of his child, and showing basic human respect to the motherof his child, ddon't sweat the small stuff. But I have a suspicion that this is deeper than just wanting to meet bmama and say hi. Let me know if I'm wrong. Blessings to you! -Mel
 
Hello Melissa, my story is kind of similar to the others but I have a friend and he's 29, we met this year in February and been together every since now, ok well anyway I'm 20, he has 4 children.  When we met he told me that the last relationship he was in was with his last kids mother which he only had one child with was a few months before he and I met. He told me he had a family but she left him and went out of town because I guess it wasn't working out. Well about maybe a month or two ago he told me that she was moving back to town because where she was wasn't working out anymore and that she would be staying with him, now mind you before she came I was going over his house and same, he was coming over mines and we was having great times,  some downfalls but we overcame them. I was having fun with his other children and him, we were living it up. He told me a little after we started being together that he loved me first so I figured I was doing something right. Now back to where I was..ok so (yes were having sexual intercourse and I loved him so much that I even got on birth control fro him! And me!) But anywho so about 5 days ago he got locked up because him and her got into a fight and she called the police on him, he told me she started welling on him all in his face so he had to defend hisself and get her off of him, they where intoxicated. But he also told me that they got into it that night because he wasn't the same as when she.got back because he had met me, but what should I think...if she moves back in with him(which he only told me it'll take only two months for her to find her an apartment or something) I knew that was a lie! But they in the same household and around each all the time and then come to find out they fought to!  I'm thinking that maybe they should get back together, even though I love him dearly with all my heart I can't compete with her especially since they have history and I never tried to compete, just was always crying and wondering if he was trying to work things out why would he still want me around? I've.been putting money on my phone so we could talk, and he's telling me he love.me more than ever! I just don't know if I should stay by his side all the way which I want to so bad or just let it go because I'm also thinking that when the tpo is off and he go back home and she's there, they have unresolved issues and I just don't want to be hurt. Can you please help me, man I really do love him he's changed some parts of me that I never thought  could change. I don't think he has sex with her, because me and him still had sex mostly every other day but sometimes we went two or three days apart without. But I wondering if they didn't have sex why did they fight? Should I hold on I just give up?

Maybe you can help me figure this out, my boyfriend dated this girl for three years, and they have a two year old together. I've known this man for seven years and he was my closest guy friend in high school, we got together in October and I was totally cool with the fact that he has a baby, when I was growing up I was in the same situation as his child. At first his ex seemed like she was happy for me and him, now not so much. She keeps making moves on him in front of me in our home when she picks up their son. I understand he has to keep things civil to be able to see his baby but its gotten past ridiculous. I know she wants him back, she broke up with him to get him to change but she did it in such a way to make him hate her, now it's my fault he won't crawl back to her. I know he loves me and I know he'd never cheat, that isn't what I'm worried about. I need a polite way to tell her back off, you gave him up and he's mine now. I'm just afraid she'll take his baby from him if I do that, and I love this baby like he was my own, I would do anything for this baby, but I'm getting tired of his mommy. Also she's dating someone now, he's in the military and is over seas. She didn't start acting this way until he left. I'm at my wits end, I've been polite and nice and respectful but with the way she keeps treating me I feel like the claws are coming out soon. My boyfriend can't do anything because she has primary custody and he wouldn't survive losing his only time with his baby. How do I handle this in a way that would make my mama proud?
 
Hello Mellissa...well i hv been dating this guy for 11months now.he has a son who wil be turning 2 in few months.i personnaly dont get into his issues with his bm bc i knw i wasnt there when it started.i dont even ask about his kid or his bm bc when i do he gets all worked up.ther hav been many times i have wanted to breakup with him, bc i always felt bad for the baby mama til i got to know more about her.this girl nags,disrespects everybody, embarrasses him everywher he goes and most of all uses their kid to manipulate him.always asking for money and is always threatening to stop him from seeing their son.he went home for vaccation and i cldnt reach him for about 3weeks because when she had th opportunity to meet his computer on, she blocked me from facebook,skype nd even when she could find his phone she blocked me too from his phone.everytime he wil unblock and if she coms hom wit the baby and his computer is on,conected,she looks for me and blocks me..it stopped i learnnt they had a fight abt it.now they are not on speaking terms i dnt know for what reason,i havnt asked.his mum told me they had a fight and he asked her never to com to their house again...to cut thgs short,its not lik we dont consider them,but at times they dont consider themslvs.she gets on the nerves of everybody, i ask myslf,hw do you do to get so much hate nd despise from every1.i even hv second thoughts about going home bc she has promised to send boys to beat me up. what do you do when you have such a girl as the bm of your boyfriend?

Donnesha, let me be real: there is a significant age difference between you and your bf and don't think for a second he's not using your naivety to his advantage. The easiest woman for a man to sleep with is one he's already slept with and being under the same roof makes creepin all the more convenient. Couple that with the fact that some men behave as if they own the body of the woman or women who have their children and you've got yourself a sloppy played game on the part of your bf. He ain't even trying to hide what he's  doing. He's just looking at you and amazed by how gullable you are. But instead of waiting for your bf and his bmama to sit you down and confess that they are still carrying on a very complicated but real love/hate relationship, why don't you protect YOU? Your bf has some unresolved issues to clear up with bmama before you or any woman that wants to be a part of his life is left feeling any way but hurt, confused and taken advantage of. If you're gonna do grown woman things, then you have to let go of your childlike naivety and protect yourself. Stay connected lil sis! -Mel
 
Mel could you please read my comment?? and help throw some light on my path. thanks
 
Vivian, thank you for your patience. I'm a working mommy plus tonight was bible study night. I did see you and now I have time to reply. To answer your question, there's nothing for you to do about babymama. Yall aren't related, don't live together and don't even live in the same city. She is not your problem. The man you're with is. I've said it time after time in different ways: until the man does the hard work of mending fences and setting boundaries with his bmama, you are in for nothing but problems. Who gets to disappear for 3 weeks while he's conveniently near his bmama and still gets to call himself somebody's boyfriend?! Apparently YOUR man does. What excuses have you forced yourself to believe in order to justify that kind of behavior from him? I'm not overly concerned about your opinion of bmama because it's biased and based on the "I'm a better woman to him than she was" slant, plus anytime bmama pisses him off, he vents to you. But unless you've taken the time to know her and hear her side directly from her, you can't formulate an accurate opinion of her, so don't.  If his bmama is all up in the mix, then your man is to blame, not her. He hasn't established appropriate co parenting relationship with his bmama. If she's close enough to touch his phone, I'd say she's too close. But that's for him to check, not you. Men make moves based on what motivates them. Sometimes it takes losing a good woman in order for a man to realize it's time for him to stop entertaining drama and drawing some clear boundary lines. But if you choose to leave, be specific and tell him why or else the lesson won't be learned. Right now, he has two women: you and bmama.  Why on EARTH would he want to fix what benefits him most? Sometimes a man has to lose in order to gain some common sense. Blessings to you!
 
A little different perspective dealing with my sons mother. My sons mother is a crazy bitch. Im not one to sugar code anything. I moved out of the house and broke off the relationship when my son was only 5 months old he is now almost 3. She has some anger issues and lashes out violently towards me. I consider myself a calm and laid back person so the drama doesn't mesh well with me. She has hit me before, broke things and thrown things at me including the meal you might be sitting there eating. She is a white woman and I'm a black man so that doesn't make matters any better especially if police show up. (Thank god that has never happened.) Sometimes people get tired of constantly defending themselves and going thru drama when all they want is time with there child. Since I moved away I still pay all the bills in the house where her and my son live. She won't work to help pay any bills. Its seems like she just wants to sit back and watch me suffer thru this situation. I would have put her out of the house years ago but she won't let me get my son and I don't want him to be in a messed up situation. She doesn't have any where to go and doesn't have friends or family to call on. What ever friends or family she does have seem to stay far away from her even her own children. I can only suspect that her acting out violently or weird behavior in the past has pushed them away. She uses my son as a pawn so I don't put her out of the house. She won't let me see my son sometimes because she uses him as a pawn like I said before. I avoid confrontation and drama especially in front of our son. She will gladly lash out violently and tare up the house while my son sits there and cries his eyes out. This is something that burns me up inside. I know she doesn't care about the house after all she doesn't pay any bills and for nothing in it. Im trying to get my son out of this situation but its easier said than done. The only solution I have found is staying away but I love my son and want to spend time with him. I get him on weekends and every time I go to pick him up is like rolling the dice. (she might act crazy she might be cool you never know)I know she had a rough childhood and has some anger issues but all I care about is my son and his welfare. When we were in a relationship I would always push her to get some form of help for her anger issues. She always made me feel like I was crazy for thinking she was crazy. One day I finally did get her to go to the hospital and if they checked her out and said she was fine I would leave her alone about it. We did go and they recommending she stay and be evaluated for a couple days. She lashed out violently trying to hit me and ran to try to escape the hospital. The police and security caught her out by the main road in front of the hospital and had to restrain her. They held her for a week at the physic ward and let her go. We weren't married and she didn't give the doctors permission to tell me anything so she came out and said she was fine. I didn't believe thats was the case so I moved out when she came back home mostly for my own safety and so my son wouldn't have to go thru the drama.The only thing I can do is stay away until figure something out.
 
Mr. Me, thank you for your comment. If you've taken the time to read my responses to others, then you have noticed that I'm big on people taking personal responsibility for the situations they  find themselves in. As s parent and if you love your son,inaction on your part is simply unacceptable. I'm not too concerned about how your son's mom treats you (afterall, you have no problem referring to her as a b* which speaks volumes), but rather the safety and wellbeing of your son. If she poses a threat to herself and your child, you must petition the court for custody. If she is not a danger to your child, I'd suggest seeking a mediator for families to sit down with the both of you to work out a co parenting plan as well as visitation and support agreement. There are two sides to every story. But your side needs to do what's best for your son. Keep me posted! -Mel
 
Hello I have a very weird story,My fiance has 2 children with another woman. This woman is insanr I mean attacking me, slander doing everything in.her power to break us.off. The two children now.live with us and I found out I am now pregnant with his child. It seems as though. He has been speaking to her everyday and I have confronted him about this because although I understand he needs to talk and discuss things in regards to the children, but it seems as more then that. We are buying a house in a month, and once the kids told her that she lost it was so mad that we where moving. We have lived together with the kids for months and it would be no surprise we would be upgrading and moving once again with eachother. He also deletes and hides everything in regards to her. Im not sure what this means, does he want to be with her? It just seems very odd to speak with your seperated partner multiple times a day for extended periods of time...Please give me some advice or a suggestion in what direction to take this matter. I apologize for misspellings as im on my cell.Thank you
 
Unknown,  thank you for your comment. Here's my advice to you. Most women do not exhibit anger and rage for no good reason. If the behavior of your fiance towards bmama is a concern to you, I can only imagine what bmama would have to say, if asked. But rather than being overly concerned about he and she, there are two other people who need your immediate attention and protection: you and your unborn child. I would strongly recommend that you and your fiance slow the train down and do this right. That means, no more playing house and postpone any impending wedding plans you may have. Better to wait on the wedding so you can have a marriage that lasts or maybe even decide that marriage isn't the way to go. I know this is hard to swallow but someone has to tell it to you straight, and I care enough to do just that. Your fiance has unfinished emotional business with his bmama which is apparent by both of their behaviors. This situation needs to slow down for the sake of the soon-to-be three children involved. Marriage isn't going to ease any tension between you all and the additional child is potentially more fuel to the fire. Your fiance has some work to do before you try to set up house and home with him and you have to be woman enough to require him to do that work before locking you down. Unfortunately,  if neither of you are willing to slow this thing down and get it right, the biggest losers in this will be the children. Yes, you are pregnant now, but so was his bmama...twice before. Slooooooow this thing dooooooown. Blessings to you! Keep me updated. Diary Of A Baby Mama has a group page on fb. Stay connected. -Mel
 
Hey Melissa, My situation is that I have a 38 year old boyfriend and I'm 20 years. Yes, its 18 years older than me but he is the reason I'm happy today. The problem is that my boyfriend has 2 kids by 2 different mothers and I've met the kids and the love me. He has a 8 year old son and a 1 year 8 month old daughter. we have been together for a year and known each other for 2 years. He never wants me to go around the kids mom not has he ever introduced me to them. When he talks to them on the phone he moves away. when i confront him he says that is how he has always been. He does not like to talk around people and that telephone calls are private. His parents accept me and know that I may someday want my own with him. But why can't for now he at least allow his kid's mothers to know me. I don't want to replace anyone. I rather seem like and aunt to them than a step mother. I LOVE the 2 kids so much, his son and I bond so well we have talks on the phone and everything. The daughter is still young and does not know what is happening. Thing is he and the mother did not officially break up they just stop relations and he moved on I don't know if she did. So maybe she still has feelings cause they have this lovely child together. He says that in time all that will come. What should I do? Do i keep asking him to meet them? or Give it up? 
 
I'm 20 and I recently moved together with my boyfriend who is 32, he has a cute 3 year old daughter from a previous relationship that he intended to have and sees her every other weekend.They broke up, went to court because she kept the child away and etc. After all the battles and arguments I came into the picture. At first I didnt want a relationship with him...but then i swayed into getting serious with him.My boyfriend has a real problem of me not posting photos of us on instagram (smh), i personally been through some events with him that doesnt motivate me to do such, i like to keep my stuff personal but he can't respect that and becuase of that he doesnt respect me much.As much as I love his daughter and she does as well, I'm starting to not like the fact he had a child from someone else, although he claims he wants nothing to do with her and she doesnt as well, they have manage to settled down more (they used to argue a lot and he would disrespect her). One instance, I went to get food for his daughter and his child's mother came to pick her up, I went to the car to give it to her and she tried to make a friendly joke with him. I'm really insecure. I just don't wanna be hurt behind my back. Seeing them go at each other's throat to being nice, it's just weird. Just makes me think they're getting comfortable although they're both in a relationship. I do know people can change their feelings. I just feel so outcasted.With his disrespect and the fact he has a child from another relationship, just makes me want to leave and he knows this... i guess I can't stand being with a man who treats others way better than me. I just wish i never loved him so much and bonded with his child so good, it just would make walking away easy, i feel guilty if I walked away, i guess i'm inclined to the negativity as well as the amouint of love i receive from.

Mellisa, i love your blog, but I need a little advice. I have two children, my babydad and I broke up about a year ago, we were together for 5 years. I recently just started dating an old boyfriend of 3 years before me and my babydad got together. we hung out once about a month ago and all the feelings we use to have for eachother came rushing back and we jumped into being together, and now we are even living together. He even wants me to quit my job and stay at home with my kids. Now here's the messy stuff....he has two kids as well. His babymom has been acting pretty crazy, but I just keep my mouth shut and stay out of it all, because I am a mom, and I know how territorial I would be with my kids if another women came along in their dads life. It would be hard. plus me and my boyfriend haven't been dating long, even though we dated for 3 years when we were younger, him having kids is all new to me. But if his babymom continues to start drama and talk crap about him having a family with me and my car seats being in his car and alll this other non sense I feel like things could get bad. I've never been the women to ignore another winona disrespect to me, and i've only kept my cool for my boyfriends sake, and for the kids. she has control as to when he can see the kids, and I don't want to do anything to jeopardize that. Its actually even hard for me to post anything to do with my boyfriend on facebook due to the mutual friends we share, i'm scared she might see and get jealous. I think she wants him back and sometimes I get worried he might want her. But he treats me amazingly, talks about marriage within the next two years, we live together, and he already has been kind of acting like a father figure to my kids, as their father isn't around for another few months when he's released from prison. Thats another thing i'm scared about, me and my babydad have an okay relationship, and I hope my boyfriend isn't threatned by that. I need advice on all this craziness!
 
I have been together with my ex boyfriend for 5 years and we were already making plans to get married before we broke up recently. I like to admit that we did have our differences and we had a few  fights often but we always got out of it. About 3 weeks ago, I literarily caught him flirting with a very close friend of mine, itâs totally unacceptable to me and that led to a separation. We broke up after that incident and I told him I never want to see him again. At this moment, itâs barely two weeks ago and I miss him already. I donât want to lose my ex boyfriend to any gold digger. I want to know how to attract my boyfriend to me again, I need to  know how to win his heart get my ex back into my life? I called him several times and he would not even pick up his phone. I donât care if I have to use psychological tricks or tips advice to win back his heart after the break up. Everything Iâve tried to do seems not to be working. I love my boyfriend, he loved me and I donât know what to do or say. He was the one who cheated on me and Iâm to forgive him. But he didnât even try to reconcile. I know he loves me, but my best friend whom he flirted with is trying to steal my boyfriend away from me,I need to reconnect and reunite our relationship, i try all my best until i mate a female great spell caster online Name Dr Kate (katelovespell@hotmail.com) i explain every thing that happened to me, she told me not to worry that she is gonna help me if only i can help my self and i told her yes. she promise to help me cast a return and love spell that last forever, after i summit my information, she cast the return and love spell and guarantee me after three days my ex-boyfriend is going to call me and asking for my forgiveness, i was so surprise the third day of it in the morning my ex-boyfriend call me on phone telling me he is come back that i should forgive him, thank you once again Dr kate (katelovespell@hotmail.com) she is the best you can reach her email address.
 
Okay, here is my situation. We known each other since we were 12&13 and had puppy love during that time. We also lived in the same neighborhood. Years past we both went on with our lives. Fast forward to now we are adults and reconnected again. We both were living back in the neighborhood I was single and he was single as well. He told me that he has a 5yr. Old son and no longer with his babysmother. We dated for six months and I chose to end things. Two months later he calls me out the blue and said I was locked up and out now and want to work things out. I was cautious but still loved him. So I pushed him away for a while then decided to give him another chance then I didn't hear from him in a few weeks. So I called him and his baby'smother picked up and was polite and said he is busy but will call you back. I never called him again bc to me his back with his babysmother and I respectd that. He called me a week later saying that we needed to talk. So we met up and he told me that he is not with his babysmother but living there for his son and bc of financial issues. He wants to continue to work on things and be with me. He told me he loves me and sorry for this situation that he is in and has nothing but respect f or  me.  I told me that his priority is his son and wants us to move in with each other. He told me he wants to be the man to take care of me and saving money for his own place. It's hard for me to know that he is living with his babymother even though I understand the situation. He calls me and we see each other everyday.Just needed advice how I should proceed with this.
 
Mimzy, thank you for your comment. Before I answer your question, let me paint a clearer picture for you: you are 20 and your bf is 38. He aleady has two children, 8 & 1. This tells me a couple things. First, he was in no hurry to have children with his first coming along at age 30. Second,  his youngest child quiteÂ possibly was born from a serious relationship. If you're going to do grown woman things,  you gotta interpret the data of your own life in a grown way. You have at least 15 more strong reproductive years. You could have your first child by 28 or 30. But your bf would be how old? Every choice you make now has a consequence. I'm 35 yrs old and I know that many men your bf's age are not sitting up wanting to have more kids if they already have them. Older men may be appealing because of their so called maturity but what makes you so appealing to an older man? Your maturity? No ma'am. It's your innocence and naivity.  A woman my age knows the game and has been played by it a few times. So right off the bat, I'm not impressed with your bf. The reason you haven't met the mothers of his children is because he feels like keeping you all apart is the best way to keep down drama. But if you want more, ask for it. And if he won't give it, leave. This whole relationship is more beneficial to him than to you. He gets a beautiful young woman with no kids who's devoted to him and you get a man slappin 40 upside the head who already has 2 kids of his own. Please reconsider.
 
Zarina, thank you for your comment. Let me share with you some key things to consider. Being in a relationship with a man who has kids is a whole nother ball game than just dating a guy who doesn't have children.  God intended for a man and woman to marry and bring children into this world from that union but what's best isn't always what's done. It's natural for you to feel some type of way about your bf having a child with someone else. The problem comes in when women choose to handle this feeling in the wrong way. Some think the solution is to have a baby by their bf which is foolish and just plain wrong. This NEVER solves the original problem but only creates a bigger one. Some women choose not to date a man with children so as to avoid all the extra stuff that comes along with kids outside of a relationship. Be honest with yourself about what you want and need from a relationship. It may be best for you to date a man who can devote himself to you (they do exist) and doesn't have kids outside of the relationship. If that's what you truly want, then there's absolutely nothing wrong with pursuing your desire. But once you decide to be with a man who has children, you have to know these feelings and insecurities you're feeling often come with the territory.  Is that what you really want? Choose wisely. 
 
I have been with my boyfriend for almost 3 yrs he's 27 and I'm 30. He has 2 children that are 7 months apart from different mothers. The oldest child's mother has moved away changed her number etc so we do not see him. The youngest child he has half custody of so he is with us half the week. Now here's the fun part. The child's mother and I did not get along at first but to avoid drama we just stayed away from each other. Me and bf broke up once last summer for a few months and got back together since then me and baby momma talked and all 3 of us were getting along fine. This summer me and him broke up again and they got back together (this also ended in me coming to move the last of my stuff out and me finding her in my house...big fight.. ) they were together maybe a month and broke up...me and him are now back together (yes I know I'm dumb for this...) now its really hard for me to accept the fact that she's going to be a part of my life as long as I'm a part of his I love him with all my heart and treat his son as if he's my own he's an amazing little man!! (None of the "drama" occurs around him but I know it affects him...when I moved back in this time he asked me if I was going to stay forever or if mama was.. awkward right?) Anyway him and her text every single day and he usually finds a reason to stop at her house at least 3 times a week never for more than say 5 minutes hut nonetheless its still a flag to me...just about everything concerning her is a flag honestly and I'm tired of feeling this way. I know he loves me as I love him I'm just not sure what actions to take to deal with her. He mentions her name at least once a day and it makes my blood boil. He's constantly talking about getting married and having a baby with me but in my mind the only reason he wants the child is to keep me in his life as he's done with her. I don't know where to turn and I'm really confused... any advice would be greatly appreciated
 
Hello Ashley. My advice? Slow down and prioritize! You've made a lot of moves already that aren't necessarily in the best interest of your children but sound more like it was done to fill your desire to have a man and family. What you have right now with your bf may feel real but it's fake because you really don't know him. People can and do change in 3 yrs. Your children already have a father who will soon be released from prison. What's your plan for this when it comes to your kids.  You have a lot more to think about right now than playing house with an old flame and worrying about his baby mama. Stop making emotional decisions and think like a parent.
 
What part of a man who has two children only 7 mos apart do you find irresistable torn? And you seem remarkably calm about him sleeping with his babymama, so much so you didn't mind sliding right back with him as soon as she gave you enough wiggle room to move back in. This isn't love. This is a sick, twisted competition between you and baby mama over this guy and he's making complete fools of you. Find enough dignity to move on. He has to deal with baby mama and has no choice. Baby mama doesn't win if you walk away because clearly he has no self control when it comes to sex, having two children a mere 7 mos apart and continuing to bounce between you and baby mama when you all fall out. Step out of this three ring circus!
 
I have been reading the blogs and i must admit that this situation fits me almost to a T the big issue is i am not the girlfriend i am the WIFE and he did have this child before me and did not have a relationship with her now he is wanting me to introduce the child to our three children.  I have a little bit a anger and pride that tells me why are we doing this you have not been doing anything why now.  A bit of me says talk to the baby mama and find out what are her objectives.  He stated that all she asked is that he call once in a while to say hello to her and maybe send her a card saying i am thinking of you.  She does not want any child support.  The child is 7 years old now.  I am torn between the happy story of its just me and our family to try and incorporate another child and her mother in our lives.  I am not sure what to do or how to handle the situation.  Not to mention i am young as well.
 
Need in love, support your husband being a father to ALL of his children. If he is a good man then don't put him in a position that makes him feel like he must choose between his wife and his child. Even if he doesn't leave you, he will resent you. Let him take the lead on how to handle this. This is about his child, not the baby mama. If you're looking for a reason to be offended, you'll always find several.  Instead, support your husband in loving his oldest child and support that child as much as he supports and loves his three with you. Like it or not, your children have another sibling. Denial won't change that. But love and support can strengthen your marriage. Blessings to you!
 
Hi Melissa. This post is old but hopefully I can get some advice from a woman who has been on both sides of the fence. I'm 24 and dating a man nine years older. He found out through a friend that his ex was pregnant after we started seeing each other. Fast forward two years later, his daughter is now one. They co-parent but do not get along well. For her first birthday they gave separate parties and she did not come to the one he planned. I get along well with his family and encourage him to spend as much time with his daughter as possible. My concern is that there seems to be some built up resentment and emotion between him and his ex. He says she did him wrong but doesn't say much else. He says he regrets hooking up with her after the breakup but loves his daughter. I feel like one day they will forgive, forget and move on together as a family... leaving me, the "girlfriend" alone and heartbroken. I normally don't date men with children but his ex's pregnancy was a surprise to us both. I want a man to call my own, without sharing between a baby mother or child. Is that selfish of me?
 
KNicole18, it's not selish, it's the kind of honesty needed in a situation like this. Consider this: the scenario you fear is the same thing you desire. You want a man who if he makes a baby with you will stand by you and his child. But you don't know if your bf is going to do this or not. But if he doesn't go back to his bmama and child, you can't help but wonder what type of man is he. You deserve a drama free life and if you don't want the drama that comes with babies,  baby mamas and daddies, you don't have to have it. Stay true to what you really want in life and yes, you can have it. Blessings to you. Check out my latest blog. I talk a bit more about dating a man who has a babymama.
 
Asia, you know what you should do. The problem is you've turned this into me vs baby mama. "She got pregnant on purpose"...your bf had sex with her more than once ON PURPOSE.  "Desperate acts to get him back"...you have a baby by someone and see what your actions become. Your fear is legit. He could very well bounce back and forth between the two of you for a long time. Question is, has this become a game you're trying to win or a life you're trying to live? Either way, it doesn't sound like you're having much fun. 
 
I am a wife with 2 kids by my husband. We've been married 11 years and have broken up and got back together. Currently we are trying to work the marriage out. In between the times we were separated he had 3 kids by 2 different women from different states. Right now we live in the same state as one baby mama. Just recently she was in a relationship and never called or asked the husband to see the kids. Now her relationship is over, she's calling, texting, emailing him and he hides it from me. Also she's gotten to the point of posting bad things on my Facebook for family and friends of mine to see. Plus texting and calling me bad names. Please keep in mind I'm the WIFE of 11 yrs. What should I do?
 
Melissa, thanks for stopping by. First let me say I don't know all the details I realize time and space doesn't allow you to tell it all. I would strongly recommend you and hubby seek out counseling because three children with two different women is no lightweight issue. Simply getting back together over and over does not address the root of the problem.  If you all are truly committed to your marriage,  invest in outside help. Find a church home if you don't have one and a licensed relationship therapist. . It may be challenging to work through it all but it's not impossible.  Blessings.  -Mel
 
Hi melissa I am 20 years old. Me and my bf have been together for a year this month. About 2 weeks ago he started acting weird and moved out of the house. He would just get angry with me for no reason. Well yesterday he finally told me that he found out that he has a 3yo daughter that he didn't know about. And now he's confused because she wants to be with him so that they can be a family after her man left her. I think she's tryin to start trouble becauseshe wasn't going to say anything until she found out he was getting married. So now he won't move back in the house. He now picks up his daughter but won't bring her around me because his bmama doesn't want no bitch excuse my language being around her which I believe iscompletely IGNORANT!!!!!! He tells me all the time that he loves me and wants to be with me. But he still won't come back home. He say that haven't been sleeping together. I just don't think its fair how just because you have a baby with somebody doesn't mean you have to be with them and it just breaks my heart how she is going to try to take him away from me. We are supposed to be getting married in February and now all of this happened. I love him to death and we have been through way too much. Idk what I should do. I pray every night that things will go back to the way we used to be. 
 
Shy,  I'm very sorry you're going through this. But your bf clearly has unfinished busy. Better to deal with it now than later. Let your man sort this out. If he's going to be the head of your house and future father of your children,  you need to fall all the way back to see if he's truly ready (and you too) for this huge commitment. Marriage is beautiful but hard work. If you're not willing to give him space and time to deal with his past that has now surfaced, you may not be ready for what marriage truly requires. Best wishes to you all! Stay connected to Diary on fb. -Mel
 
Hi Melissa, I am 20 years old my boyfriend is 24 and he has a 2 year old boy. We've been going out for 7 months and things are doing ok. This is the first time I've dated a man with a kid,I  never thought of myself as the type of person who would. I am young and have a whole life ahead of me why should I trouble myself and get involved with something as delicate as this situation? Love is blind, deaf, unpractical and oh so stupid.But I am resolved to try and make things work, but I am scared. I'm scared I'm getting myself involved in something that I wont be able to handle.The fact that he is still technically married to the babymama angers me greatly. Legally separated doesn't mean much to me. Recently, he had to unfortunately move back to his mom's house for financial reasons. The babymama works for his mom taking care of his very old grandfather. They both see each other everyday. In my (although biased) opinion she is still way to involved in his life, it is completely understandable that they both have to communicate and stay on friendly terms for the sake of their son but she still expects him to get her out of trouble whenever she is dealing with a difficult situation. Whenever her car breaks he gives her a ride home, when she is running short on cash she asks for money, when she is having issues with her own boyfriend she talks about her sex life with him. Am I wrong to want to set some  boundaries? I've never met her in person nor do I want to. My boyfriend swears that he does not want to get involved with her ever again. Then why does he allow  this kind of relationship with her?He has his son everyday now because apparently the babymama has an unstable living situation. We barely get to spend time with each other. I want this to work but I need advise please help?
 
Hey Melissa my name ieshia and my story is a lil different from others .. OK so I have a lil girl and. My bf has a lil but I don't have a problem with that baby mother.my bf had hot this girl pregnant and she lost her baby but he tells me that they Dont talk or whatever but he always talking on the phone with her she always come get him when he needs a ride so she texted me an asked Me do I still talk to him do they still got some going on? 
 
Mrose, I want to tell you something I wish someone had told me at your age:You will meet a lot of men in your lifetime. Do NOT waste your time trying to make a relationship work. The right ones work wirhout all the extra effort. And any relationship that you can't seem to walk away from, despite all the drama and pain it brings is the one you definitely should walk away from. Stay connected! Blessings.  -Mel
 
Ieshia, I don't know the answer to that. All I know is that you have a man who likes to maintain contact with women he's had sex with. And the easiest person to have sex with again  is someone you've already had sex with. Govern your actions and decisions accordingly.
 
Hi Melissa, I really need some advice / guidance thru my current situation. Me and my boyfriend have a 3 yr old son together. Weve been on and off for about 4 years now. During one of our "off" periods he started dealing with someone , whom he later had a child with about 8 months after i had my son. There have been occasions where we would go through our problems, break up, and he would run back to her, emotionally and sexually. The last time that they had sex was in May, and its bothering me because he says im stuck on the past, and im acting like a child when i express how i feel about the situation. Honestly, this has made me insecure, because his bm still has feelings for him, and im not sure if he still has feelings for her, even when he tells me he doesnt. We have moved in together, so its getting pretty serious now, but I am still dealing with my thoughts of them.How can i get past this feeling, knowing she honestly doesnt respect my relationship with him because she feels like shes entitled to certain things that she isnt? I know shes going to have to deal with him b/c they have a child. I try to explain the reason i feel like this is because of him..if he didnt have a history of going back and forth with her, I wouldnt feel as insecure. Please, I need your help as to how to handle this. Thank You!
 
Hello Kiauna. Your bf and his bmama may have a history of going back and forth with each other, but you also have a history of taking him back after he's been with her. You have allowed a viscious cycle of breaking up and making up to continue. In order to break this cycle you must do something new.My suggestion? Stop breaking up.Break ups are meant to be permanent,  not something two people do when they're mad, hoping that the other will change. If you want to be with him, that means that the thing that has caused you to break up in the past can no longer affect you.Never, ever break up with a man hoping it will motivate him to change his ways. It won't and your bf has proven that. Commit to the relationship, whether it's good, bad or ugly or be prepared to let it go completely.  That is the mature thing to do.Stop this unhealthy cycle sis Blessings to you and stay connected!  -Mel
 
Like many I am glad I found this blog because I have been feeling a bit uneasy about my relationship and surely do not want to play the fool but nor do I want to blow things way out of proportion. So Melissa here is my story. I have been dating this man for a few months. When we first hung out one of tge first questions I asked was if he had kids he gave me a joking answer saying I may have many so I took it as it was and just said he didnt look like he had kids...he didnt correct me. A few months later I took his phone jokingly and saw he got nervous so I demanded to know what he was hiding which resulted in him telling me he may have a child. He told me a bit of the story still holding back with a bit of lies. We have argued about it constantly with of course me bringing it up. In the middle of December we got into it and I called my mother and it was as if she knocked some sense into me. She told me he is still lying if the girl loves him he has been knowing about the baby longer then what he said. He had told me he just found out about the baby but the baby was already born when he told me and is now 6 months old. So I confronted him and thats when I finally got the truth (I think). He had know. Since the beginning through out her pregnancy.  They had talked about being a family but he says it never worked out. He has held the child changed diapers etc meanwhile I had eexpressed to him how unfortunate it was he hadnt done that and hopefully he could build a relationship with the baby again he hadnt corrected me. Then he decided about two weeks ago that he needed a break from us and needed to know I could accept everything. Then he decides he cant do it without mme.I know she still has feelings for him obviously and last night she called and wished him a happy new year and asked if she and him were good. And that was it. That phone call nags at me as I found it inappropriate she didnt mention the child nothing.  In my eyes it was an irrelevant phone call but to him he thinks it is justified and there was nothing wrong with it because supposedly she was speaking on behalf of the child. We have been arguing about it and I still cant come to terms with it. Am I being irrational? He says he just doesnt want any drama and turmoil so it doesnt effect his relationship with the child but im having a hard time accepting and understand ing what are proper boundaries and what is appropriate and inappropriate.  He says he expects her to call on holidays and his birthday because it is on behalf of his daughter who cannot do that yet. Is this appropriate? 
 
Confused,  let me paint a picture for you. You and your man are construction workers on a construction site. All of the materials are there. You put up the frame, walls and roof. But what's missing? A firm FOUNDATION.  A principle that will serve you well in life is this, if you heed it: There is no relationship where there is no trust. Period. There may be walls and frame but there is no stability and eventually,  it will crumble.His bmama and child isn't the issue.  In a previous post, I caution women from getting involved with me who have very young children for this very reason. He lied to you because he knows the situation with bmama is still fresh and any thinking woman isn't about to take up with him if she knows all the details. Let your man handle his business as a father. He's not ready to be serious yet and instead of being straight with you, he lied. I'm sorry he lied and you caught feelings, but now that you know his situation isn't resolved, the choice is yours. You can't make a man respect boundaries when he has none. If a man wants your heart, he should already have boundaries in his life that reassure you that he's completely for the relationship he has with you. Blessings and Happy New Year!

Hi melissa my situation is my husband n I got married last year and he has a 2 yr old son and his baby momma knows how I look because he had pic of me on his comp when he was living with her he just move out last December of 2013. I still was dealing with him and they use to quarrel she use to make fuss of little stuff.but my thing is she don't know we married don't know we live together and the other thing she call 2-3 in the morning to talk not emergency call but talk esp about her family problem so is it wrong for me to tell him DAT why all of a sudden y'all want to be close friends and he did confess he has love for her but I think he still on love Caz when I try to defend myself against her he jump down my throat and yell at me.bit he can't do DAT to her.they plan trips behind my bk I find out when he talking to other ppl dats  how I find out she send me stuff in my email but I don't tell him but when ppl Facebook request her she thinks its me and tell him.then he tells me I'm trying to come between a child being with both his parents and seeing his parents togetber .I know I might be jealous but the things she does I have to trying to loose weight even though he said he love me I still don't know what to do Caz I'm fed up its best they get bk together and live since they so loving.
 
Sidechick21, I have some questions for you to ponder: It seems like you have some lingering questions and uncertainties. Why then did you decide to get married BEFORE your concerns about your husband's bmama were addressed? You had uncertainties and insecurities before you married and guess what?  Now they're still here. My advice? Believe what your husband tells you. The only way your marriage has a ghost of a chance to survive is if you have trust. If he tells you it's over between him snd bmama, believe him. Anyone would get tired of being accused for every little thing they do. Delete and block bmama from Facebook and focus on your marriage. If you don't,  you won't have a long lasting marriage.  Blessings to you. Stay connected! 
 
recently I just found out that my sons father fathered a child with someone else just like a day before we got together. and so my son and her son are only two months apart. I'm having a hard time accepting it I don't want to be feeling the way that I am. I'm not even sure how it will workout. they haven't done a dna tests yet but we are pretty sure the child is his because the other guys dna test came back as not being the babys father. Last year he was flirting with her and saying perverted things and it broke me and he made it seem like we were a mistake to him and he messed it up with her. but they didn't even know each other but that one night and he ripped the condom. I am just not sure how to deal with this even after he found out she was pregnant two weeks after that he never brought it to my attention and kept it a secret for a year. So I'm nervous and afraid of going through that hurt again with him flirting with her. its hard to deal with and I'm not sure how to do this without being jealous of another woman. I would like some advice. I'm trying to figure out the next step Iknow we can't change the past but accept it and cope with it I'm afraid of the things that will happen in future
 
Bernadette, don't get overwhelmed. The turmoil you feel is due to trying to predict other people's feelings and actions. The only person you can control is you and the only thing you know for sure is in the here and now. Can you trust your son's father NOW? Is he fully committed to you NOW?  Aside from being your son's father,  which he may be good at, is he good to YOU? You can't make a good daddy be a good boyfriend nor should you confuse the two. This other woman and her child is not your issue. Your focus should be on figuring out if what you have NOW is real or just all on you. Only you can make that call. But you deserve a man who's as honest and committed to you as you are to him. Blessings to you and stay connected! 
 
Hi Melissa,I like your advice! Maybe you can help me- and I know the problem is in me so let me go ahead and get that said.I met my Husband when his son had just turned one. We worked together. We fell in love over that first year and got married but he had issues with his child's mom allowing him to see his son and I wasn't very involved. A year after our wedding she moved back in town and he immediately filed legitimation and child support so he could begin to have rights to see his child. I fell in LOVE all over again! His near three year old became the apple of my eye and I only love him more every day.He is turning 7 this month, and I thought my concerns would have disappited by now. This is whats happening;When she first came back into town, my husband had to be in her presence for all time he spent with his son for about four months. That summer ((very early on)) my husband went to the swimming pool with them and she tried wrapping her legs around him where he says he pushed away to the deep end and she giggled and asked him if he had a girlfriend. Thats when he told her about me. They went to dinner, visited museums and did numerous other family things together in this time. I'm sure you can imagine my silent tears on car rides home from work and sleepless nights while he slept happily next to me.Finally, it was arranged for me to meet his son and his bmama. She answered the door and i smiled, trying to ignore the jealousy I had felt. I hugged her and told her I was so happy to meet her. We ate and I chased the three year old around, making him giggle.I thought I had done it all right. I thought everything would get easier.While it did get easier, its still a constant uphill battle. His mom is an over-protective type. I don't have children but I can understand wanting to protect this precious boy. She is ALWAYS telling my husband what to do, how to spend his time with his son. She says things about me under her breathe or in a nonchalant way that make me feel like she is trying to make me look bad to my husband. She moved in with a new man about a month after she met me. A year later, they were married and have their own little broken family problems (she has two totally gorgeous baby mamas who I'm sure drive her nuts). But every day I hurt over her. Every day my thoughts go back to disliking her and wishing I didnt have to put up with her. Every day I am bitter and eaten up by my disdain for her behavior. She puts her son between their problems and doesnt care how her actions her their son, so long as it also hurts my husband. HOW do I STOP obsessing over her? Taking negative things she's says about me and doing them better JUST because she said them...I'm afraid to have children and bring them into this venomous situation. I like what you said about how we are all a family now and I dont want her to be a part of my children's family. Please help :( This is my first time asking anyone about it.Sorry its so long!Thank you in advance!
 
Hey Melissa,My husband and I met at work when his son had just turned one and his bmama had just moved to another state with baby to live with man 2 of 4 since my husband. He and I fell in love over that year and got married. About a year after our wedding day, bmama came back just before the child turned 3 and my husband immediately went to her local court house to legitimate the child and establish child support. My husband was allowed to see the child in his bmamaâs presence and on her schedule and made every arrangement to do so. They went out to eat, went to parks and museums and did all of that family stuff to get my husband re-aquainted with his son and I was not involved at all. One of their first outings was to her swimming pool that summer. I later found out she tried to wrap her legs around him and he says he pushed away from her  to the deep end. She giggled and asked if he had a girlfriend. Thatâs when she found out about me. Their âfamily timeâ went on for about four months. I had countless cry sessions on my drives home from work and sleepless nights while he lay next to me sleeping happily. I trusted him and had every reason to. He is a good and honest man. But that didnât make it hurt any less.After those four months, they decided it was time for me to meet his son- and her. He had told me she bad-mouthed me when she could and he only lightly defended me, for fear she would rip his son away again. I was nervous for the coming drama. She had us over for dinner. When she opened the door, I stifled my grief and greeted her with a big smile and hugged her, saying I was so happy to meet her. I fell in love all over with my ânew manâ. I spent some time chasing giggles out of their son after dinner and I still grow closer to him every day. I thought everything would be easy. I thought I had done everything right.She met a man and moved in with him a month after meeting me. My husbandâs son will be seven this month. She is bitter. She will hurt herself and hurt their sonâs well being if it means hurting my husband. The last five years have been the hardest uphill battle I have ever faced. But that is not the issue. The issue is, I cannot cope with her behavior. I hate her for the way she hurt my husband in the past by ripping his son away from him. I hate how she does things out of spite to hurt him and I hate how she puts their son in the middle of it- hurting him too. We had to pay tens of thousands of dollars to see his son every other weekend, every other holiday, every Wednesday afternoon and every July. I am so drowned in my bitterness to her. I cant understand how she can be so mean. I think about it day and night. I obsess over wanting to make her jealous and fight with wishing I could want to show compassion.I like what you said about the broken family being family now. I would love to come to a point where I think of her as family. But I donât know how to fix this. I donât know how to adjust my emotions and her behaviors. Is there something I should do to make her see me as more of a friend? Am I just doomed to live in this for the rest of my life? Iâm so distraught. What do you think?

HeavyHeart, first, I salute your courage in posting here! Your pain and frustration is a major reason why this blog exists. Too many women are going through this. That's why I caution women to "don't date, investigate".Your focus, like many women, was on you and your husband's romance. It wasn't until you married him that you discovered the complication of his relationship to his bmama. My advice to you is to stay focused. While it's true that you all are family that doesn't mean you all are married. The only relationship that needs to be priority to you is your marriage.  Second, let your husband take the lead on how to deal with bmama and then trust him. He created this family dynamic by having a child out of wedlock so it's his responsibility to handle it. So far, it sounds as if he's doing just that. You all don't have to be one big happy family grinning and bearing one another. The important thing is that your husband has an opportunity to be a part of his son's life. Blended families take a LOT of work and not all scenarios play out like Will and Jada. So relax, trust your husband to make good decisions concerning his son, support his decisions and the be confident in your position as the love of his life. This situation is not as bad as it seems and it will improve as soon as your attitude about it changes. Blessings to you!

Melissa, I have found your blog to be so absolutely helpful and enlightening. I love and respect your clear view on things, and I can't tell you how much reading your blog has helped me realize some things. Also reading some of the other comments with women who have certain situations and reading your answers has helped as well. Hopefully very soon I'll have enough time to type out my specific situation and get your advice on it. I could really use it. I'm just really glad I ran across your blog. Bless you for writing this and helping women!~Sara
 
Sara, thank you so much for your comments and encouragement! You are why I do what I do. Please subscribe to this blog and stay connected to Diary's fb page. Blessings to you!
 
Hello melissa
 
Melissa,I'm hoping you're still read this blog. If not, I'll have to find another internet source to make me feel better lol.I(21) have been with my boyfriend(23) for a year and a half, and have been in his 2 year old (almost three) sons life for almost just as long. Maybe a month or two less. In the beginning, our relationship was rocky, and we were on and off. Then we did great for a while. But about 3 months ago, he decided to enlist into the Navy. I was angry and sad because it interfered with plans we had already made that I was excited about, and I didn't want to have a long distance relationship and what not... So our relationship went back to rocky. But about 3 weeks before he left to boot camp, we decided we loved eachother enough to try to make it work. Keep in mind,since we got together (happy with my boyfriend or not),I spent as much time as I could with his son, did things for him, helped his dad with money when things weren't so stable, and was honestly a very good mother figure to him while his mama wasn't there. I've always respected my boyfriends sons mother, and we've never had any issues until now. Because we weren't stable before he left, she is not allowing me to visit her son while he's at his grandmas or aunts houses (boyfriends parents don't live near us, so that's where the family would get to see him). She told me that when my boyfriend gets back from the Navy (4 years),if we are still together, then I'll be able to see him. I couldn't believe it, because even she told me how thankful she was that I loved her son and that she appreciated me. Why the sudden change? I tried to reason with her and told her I wouldn't continue my relationship with his family or son if I didn't see it working out. I know it's not good for little ones to be seeing the whole back-and-forth crap. I asked her to please reconsider her decision and allow my family and I to visit him when we can, and still no. I don't understand and it is so unfair. He is not my child,I know that, but it hurts so much to know that I can't see him. We had a very close relationship, he was very comfortable with me, and I'm so heartbroken over this. My first thought was that she didn't like me at all and couldn't wait until he left for the Navy, because since he had to sign over the child support stuff, she has full custody of him for now.I don't want to hate her. I want to understand her. I want to see some good out of her reasoning. But I'm furious and helpless because I know that he will forget me, and I've put all my love and many memories into this situation. Please help :(

I really think you focus to much on how the baby mama feels instead of the gf. Just because the gf and bf aren't married means nothing! Because at the end of the day the gf has feelings as well. She to has to find a balance & she to wants to be & continue to be happy. Just because another woman has a child by your man doesn't mean you hve to give all of your power away or move on. Gf dont just want to lose what they hve because "people" feel there's no hope in making a relationship work. I'm not saying it want take so work or time to accept the situation but everything takes time & if your man wants you just as much as you want him. He will find Balance!!

Cyria, thank you for comment. Allow me to clarify something for you and others who may read this: this blog is called "Diary Of A Baby Mama" because it is written from a baby mama's perspective. I encourage women, whether they're wives, gf's or bmamas to take ownership of the issues discussed here and not to be victims who blame others for their misery. Thanks for stopping by. Please feel free to read other blog posts of mine. This one is just a popular subject. Blessings to you!
 
Hello Melissa!I(21) have been with my boyfriend(24) for a year and a half, and have been in his 2 year old(almost three) sons life for almost just as long. Maybe a month or two less.In the beginning, our relationship was rocky, and we were on and off. Then we were amazing for a long time until about 3 months ago, when he decided to enlist into the Navy. I was angry and sad because it interfered with plans we had already made that I was excited about, and I didn't want to have a long distance relationship and what not... So our relationship went back to rocky. But about 3 weeks before he left to boot camp, we decided we loved each other enough to make it work.Keep in mind, since we got together(happy with my boyfriend or not), I spent as much time as I could with his son, did things for him, helped his dad with money when things weren't so stable, and was honestly a very good mother figure to him while his mama wasn't there. I've always respected my boyfriends sons mother, and we've never had any issues until now.Because our relationship wasn't stable before he left, she is not allowing me to visit her son while he's at his grandmas or aunts houses (my boyfriends parents don't live near us so that's where the family would get to see him). She told me that when my boyfriend gets out of A-School(8 months) if we are still together, then I'll be able to see him. I couldn't believe it because even she told me a while ago how thankful she was that I loved her son and she appreciated me. Why the sudden change? I tried to reason with her and told her that I wouldn't continue my relationship with his family or her son if I didn't see it working out. I know it's not good for little ones to be seeing and back-and-forth crap. I asked her to please reconsider her decision and allow my family and I to visit him when he is with my boyfriends family. But still the answer was no. I don't understand and it is unfair. He is not my child, I know that, but it hurts so much to know that I cant see him. His son and I had a very close relationship. He was very comfortable with me, loved me, and I'm so heartbroken over this. My first thought was that she didn't like me at all and couldn't wait until he left for the Navy, because since he had to sign over the child support stuff, she now has full custody of him.I don't want to hate her. I want to understand her. But I'm furious and helpless because I know that he will forget me, and I've put all my love and many memories into this situation. Please help Melissa! My boyfriend and I are doing very well and I see myself marrying this guy. I'd like to not hate her for the rest of my life over this.
 
Cyria I think this blog is to help EVERYONE. I thank God for Melissa and her wise words because it has helped me out as a Bm and a woman. So get off the defense and LISTEN. There's a lesson here for us All. She's just tryna spare another sister for investing her time and hard earned work into a dead end situation that doesn't manifest into the prize...The  ring. I know gf's hate to see certain things but the truth is the truth.
 
Natasha, there are risks involved when you're building a relationship with someone and one of those risks is having your heart broken, not just from your guy but in separation from his children. Unfortunately you've gone as far as you can to improve the situation but mom is right in this instance. Admittedly, you and your guy have not been stable long enough to convince her that you'll last and as a mom, she's not willing to set her child up for potential heartbreak and rightfully so. But here's what you CAN do: if you truly believe that you and your guy have the real thing and you love his child, continue to do the work to build a strong, stable relationship. I know it may not seem like much of a benefit with the child not being there around you, but taking the time to work on your relationship is the best and most mature thing you can do. If bmama is wrong, prove it. Focus on your relationship. A child can only stand to benefit when parents have a loving, healthy and stable relationship. Blessings!
 
I have a bit of an age issue compared to everyone else here. I'm 40 and my bf is 44. Before me he dated a 22 yr and she got pregnant  and since had the baby.  I have 2 older kids(11 & 15) and so does he(11 & 22). We used to plan our future together until he had to go for a dna test. I think that really made it real. He doesn't want to drag me in the middle of this because it was a bad situation with her & her family. Not the typical bad either, worse. So he says he doesn't want to bring anyone into this with this family if he is the father. I think that should be my choice & I already understand what it's like to not get along with ex's & their family. I'm not really sure how to reassure him at this point or just let him go. :( Thank you for reading. 
 
Ava, thanks so much for stopping by. I'll move straight to the point. Your bf is telling you as nicely as he can that he does not want to have to manage a relationship with you and a bmama so he's choosing the bmama. He's masking this truth with making it sound like he's trying to protect you from his drama, but he's really trying to avoid the drama he's anticipating. It's not right nor fair and it's also not your job to try to argue this point with him. When people tell you who they are and WHERE they are in life, believe them. This is where he is. A loyal man that deeply loved you wouldn't be trying to abandon you for the sake of sparing you drama but would hold on tight when things got tough to fight it out TOGETHER. That's what YOU would do in similar circumstances, right? Accept nothing less. Blessings to you and guard your heart! 
 
Hi Melissa. Thank you for posting!!I'm 20 years old and my boyfriend recently had a baby with another girl (she was pregnant while we were dating but told my boyfriend to leave her alone and it was not his baby, it was her current boyfriend's baby). Then the baby is born looking exactly like my boyfriend but she still continues to believe it was her current boyfriend's child. A few weeks to a month later, she asks my boyfriend if he would like a paternity test. Results show that my boyfriend is in fact the father and a few days later we break up. I was highly upset of course but realized there was nothing I could do. And he told me he just wouldn't be able to live with himself if he did not try to work with his ex for the baby's sake. I let him go. Eventually, he comes back when he realized they broke up for a reason and a child just makes things harder for them to get along. So now the baby is 9 going on 10 months old and the ex is living with the boyfriend she was with when she was pregnant and I'm living with my boyfriend when I am home from school. I engage with the child but never try to be munipulitive by spoiling the child or having him say mama and call me mama. The only thing I've done is post pictures of him and I and she feels "disrespected". I assure you this is not my goal. I try putting myself in her shoes and I do understand her frustration but then I think of how I plan to spend the rest of my life with my boyfriend which means I will become a stepparent. She tells my boyfriend she's happy I'm there for Lucas but doesn't want me to display on Facebook that I do care for the child. Maybe I'm trying to take on the "wife" role before I am in fact his wife but I just don't see the big deal about pictures. It's not like I'm posting them with a caption saying me and my son. I post saying me and my little friend showing that I simply would like to be this little guy's friend until I become his stepmom. I don't want the child growing up thinking I don't like him because his mother would not like me to display how I care for him. She has even gone to the extreme of reporting my pictures on Facebook. On the other hand, her boyfriend may not post as much as me (he also isn't on Facebook as much as me in general) but has posted a picture of them on Facebook and shares posts about being a dad. Although my boyfriend sees these post and is a little hurt, he bites his tongue and realizes this is how it will be since he decided to have unprotected see with a woman he did not believe he could spend the rest of his life with. She is constantly the one fighting with us and although we question a lot of the things she does and how it makes us feel we simply just avoid the confrontation for the baby's sake. She does her own thing and posts about and we do our's. But she always finds a problem with us.Sorry this is so long but I need help from someone in my position. I don't want to disrespect anyone and would like for me to understand what is okay for me and what's not okay. 
 
sam95, thanks so much for posting. Here's my advice to you: pull the plug on you and your boyfriend's facebook connection to baby mama. There's absolutely no reason on God's green earth for the three of you to know each other's moves on social media and remaining low key stalkers of one another is just another excuse to remain petty and immature. You all already have a child that is 10 months old. Where are the grown up's? Ninety percent of your stress would be removed if you deleted/blocked baby mama and had your boyfriend do the same. If she needs to communicate, do so the grown up way: it's called a phone or face to face. You can post whatever you like when she doesn't have access to your facebook page and there's absolutely nothing illegal or immoral about posting pictures of your boyfriend's child when the child is with the two of you. Personally, I'm leery of others posting pics of my children because everybody isn't on the up and up online but there's little I can do if their father decides to do so. That's his business. Stop worrying about things that don't matter and definitely don't keep mess going on social media. Block!

For Women Who Want The Ballerific Life!  Royce sure knows how to pick them. She thought she had a catch with her new & youngerÂ boyfriend, Dezmon Briscoe of the Tampa Bay Bucs but it looks like he has a little baggage he can't let go of....a baby mama who apparently didn't like what she saw on television last night! Christina Nero of Dallas, TX is the mother of Dezmon Briscoe Jr and according to some text messages she so nonchalantly dropped on Royce via Twitter, Dez has been trying to get that old thang back. Â  Â   Â  Looks like she didn't like what she saw on TV because just last night she sent the following tweets: Â  "I swear I almost threw up watching bbw fake ass relationship.Â In your 30 and your ass too Gullible #NotAGoodLookMaam.Â Any REAL woman, would encourage her man to come see his son or hell at least buy a pack of diapers" Â  And then... Â    Â  "After this tweet I'm done Dezmon don't text me, no we aren't going to be a family, no you can't take me out to eat or no you can't see me.Â Unless it pertains to our son I don't want to hear from you! Which means I won't be hearing from you!"- Christina Â  Â  In typical baby daddy behavior, I'm sure he'll spin this to Royce by saying "I said all those nice things to her because she be trippin! She won't let me see my child unless we're together". Hopefully Royce doesn't fall for the okie doke and she runs as fast as she can! She is clearly being played and baby mama is clearly not going to let this die. These young boys are a mess! Maybe Royce's dad was right! . Updated: I guess I was right about Dez's excuse and it also looks like Royce responded, in which baby mama Christina offered up more proof.    Come on now Royce, don't be stupid. Below is Dez's number if you're feeling freaky.  To which Royce replied...

 yay!!! I feel so good!! I sent youu these Dets!! loveee you eleven you my girrl!!Â  Thank ya girl :) this is a mess... the funny thing is the texts where he is coming at her don't have a date only the last one... which could technically be interpreted however many ways...from what I have seen he is always publicly flirting with Royce. She got in her feelings she has been waiting for this. So messy! @ Siren, I tried to put them in order the best I could assume but the first one DOES say Easter...so its very recent (unless it was last easter lol). Then again I doubt it was last easter because the baby doesn't look like he was alive back then LOL I feel you but they look like drafts not texts...something in the milk ain't clean. She got in her feelings when she heard him say that he was deeeply in love on tv. I think BM played herself by writing: That alone sounds to me like she was some thirsty azz chick who let a rich boy hit FOR FREE Well.. Ain't this a lesson learned for Royce.. don't go bragging about something that isn't completely yours... Damn. He's sexii too. smh.Â  And uhh, what she got, a Boost Mobile phone???Â  I bet it's a flip joint... Mhm.. BM is obviously doing this for attention she's spilling more tea... Eleven check it out Well the baby mama was right about one thing....Royce is hella guillable and too old to still be that way. Each season there is a different dude andÂ every dudeÂ she claim is "the one". They both look stupid going back n forth when it seems he is playing them both if he is dating Royce but still trying to hook up with his baby mama. So I don't know why the BM thought she was proving anything special with the texts. She showed his texts but why didnt she post her replies?Â She is tripping. Â  Royce needs to learn to shut up period. She can't call out anyone else on sleeping around when she is with a new one every month. Comment Join Baller Alert.com

 Well, itâs that time of year again. Coldness. Darkness. Silence. Boredom. Illness. Frozen barren landscapes. Sadness. You got it! Itâs time to celebrate love! Yep, Valentineâs Day is rolling into town. A day unlike any other; a day devoted to spending money on the people we love the most (who are already the people we spend all of our money on anyway). Still, the Hallmark family has to have their Zillion Dollar Day, so we might as well just get on with it. As a father and a husband, I want to let my wife, my Baby Mama, know that I appreciate her. And so, in the weeks leading up to the 14th of February, I try to let my imagination climb the high peaks of possibility and conjure up wonderfully original gifts that I can give her to celebrate our eternal bond. Unfortunately, I have fallen on myÂ  face nearly every single year. So this year, instead ofÂ  putting all of my Mega-Valentine Energy towards disappointing my wife, Iâve decide to step outside the box, and help other guys like me actually get it right.

Don't be this guy. Sure, to some folks nothing says 'I love you' like a special Valentine cut porterhouse. But chances are that person isn't the one who shares this life with you. If you have to buy this, I totally understand. Just stick it in the freezer for yourself for another day.

Love Is Back, Part 1
 2 of 20


Sometimes, we get swept up in an idea. Dang, we think to ourselves, she is going to see this and remember why she fell in love with me in the first place! Uhhh..excuse me... but no. No she's not.

Love Is Back, Part 2
 3 of 20


Putting Baby Mama's name in ink is sorta cliche at this point, huh? Tons of fellows have the name of that special someone, or that special ex-someone, living forever down next to Bart Simpson on their calf. So, when you decide to take it up a notch or two, and nail something even more original to knock her socks off (and maybe more!) when you come home Valentine's night, just remember I warned you that you are going to freak her out. And not in a good way.

Getaway! GET AWAY!
 4 of 20


Every year around this time a lumbering cliche of Yeti proportions comes barreling out of the woods and collapses in the backyard. His old Indian name is Bedandbreakfast. Or Bed and Breakfast, to you and me. Don't get me wrong: there is nothing wrong with treating your Baby Mama to an awesome relaxing night or two away from the hustle and flow of your kids, but make certain you do your homework here. Plan the thing out. Research inns in the country or hotels in the city. Don't think that horrific weekend getaways are just the stuff of sitcoms. Otherwise, you may find yourself all alone, walking along some backwoods lane in rural Vermont, with that Yeti close behind.

The New Spice/The Wrong Spice
 5 of 20


So-called experts claim that monogamous couples need to find new and exciting ways to liven things up in the sack. And they're probably right. I mean, it doesn't necessarily take a skeevy Dr. Phil to shine a little light on the fact that physical romance ebbs and flows with time, right? Okay fine. But, please. When you are out there shopping around for that spicy little Valentine gift for the little lady, make sure it's something super right for the job. Otherwise you might end up in these with one of your buddies, as she points the revolver at you.

Honey, I Knew Youâd Love A New Candyland!
 6 of 20


Yes, the little one or little ones that you share with Baby Mama are the precious/expensive/wonderful glue that holds the whole family together. No one will argue that. Still, DO NOT make the very specific and fatal mistake of confusing her love for her children with a Valentine's Day gift for her that involves the children. A picture of her and the kids is okay, but beyond that, make sure what you get her isn't something that is only fun or useful with the bambinos hanging on it or eating it or riding it or wearing it, too.

Brutal Honesty Is Not Romantic, Part 1
 7 of 20


I'm not gonna lie. There are times when, if a Great White Shark happened to be swimming past my wife while we were doing one of our ocean frolics after a massive fight, there are times when I might nudge her a little towards the hungry man-eater. There, I said it, okay? YOU, on the other hand, probably shouldn't be broadcasting that particular message on Valentine's Day with a gift like this. Unless, of course, you have, like, $600 just sitting around and a Baby Mama/lover with the most epic imagination under the sun.

Brutal Honesty Is Not Romantic, Part 2
 8 of 20


Passing on the shark was probably a good idea, but in all honesty, you might wanna re-visit the shark again if you are seriously thinking about a gift for her like this. She already probably senses that half the time she is talking to you you aren't even listening: you're thinking about food. Don't do it, dude. Yes, she WOULD be cute in this. But she will never ever see it that way.

Wino Charm
 9 of 20


For a lot of wonderful Baby Mamas, there is nothing like a glass of wine at the end of the day to take the edge off the chaos of parenting. However, allow me to subtly inform you that there is a fine line between the delicate flower who enjoys a glass of Pinot Grigio or two and the type of wild sauce guzzler who needs a crocheted glass holder on a lanyard to make it through the night. Although, if you're looking for Christmas ideas for moi...

Dream Griddle
 10 of 20


The name says it all, really. The Dream Griddle is that long lost link between modern Valentine's day gifts for your sweetheart and dragging home a clobbered antelope for the woman you force to cower in your cave. I know, I know: everyone loves to wake up to the smell of sizzling bacon. But take it from me, you can go too far with breakfast meats; and giving her this would qualify.

FaceBookFace
 11 of 20


Perhaps your sweet gal enjoys her private time out in cyber space? Perhaps you notice that she really revels in her 'alone' time catching up on her favorite blogs and websites, watching YouTube videos of squirrels who water ski. Well, if that's the case, at first glance this little creation seems intriguing/warm/ and fuzzy. But then, reality kicks in, and you realize that unless your Baby Mama is hanging out in the rec room of a sanitarium, the giving of this gift to her this Valentine's day will likely haunt you for the rest of eternity.

Puppy Mistakes
 12 of 20


A this point in the history of the world, some exceptionally bizarre people have probably figured out the ways to have puppies born with little marketable fur patterns. You know: Christmas Trees, Hearts,  Pittsburgh Steelers logos. whatever. The thing is, you need to be aware of this mega-fact, okay? Okay, here it it. Unless she pretty much already KNOWS that she is getting a puppy or a kitten or a tarantula because she already pointed at the one she wanted when you BOTH went shopping for the pet you were going to 'surprise' her with on Valentine's Day, then actually giving her a pet is more than likely the worst idea you have ever had.

A Royal Screw (Up)
 13 of 20


On rare occasions, we cross paths with the sort of gag gifts that we, in the deepest crevices of our senses of humor, believe will both make our Baby Mama chuckle and feel a little frisky at the same time. Beware. This notion is completely false and fake and there is not even a drop of truth contained anywhere within its bird-brained conception (pun intended). Gifts like these "condoms of distinction" are called Gag Gifts for a reason. Plus, if they don't work: she might end up giving birth to a King or a Queen and how the heck are you going to afford that?

The Cabelas Rule
 14 of 20


There is nothing in Cabelas that your Baby Mama wants for Valentine's Day. There are things that you want her to want. But that is a much different thing and to confuse the two would simply be the tragedy of a simple fool.

Big Bad Lingerie
 15 of 20


Every man likes to imagine his sweetheart in nothing but 11-inch shimmery stiletto boots and a size-small lobster net. But beware when you're out there buying her the lingerie of your dreams: make sure you spend a little and try and get her something quality that will feel good on her, and not just look good to you. I mean, let's face it, you'd be happy with two McDonald's french fry bags and a pair of Daisy Dukes. Actually, come to think of it, so would I. But still, get her the nice stuff, not the NASCAR stuff.

Beer Carvings
 16 of 20


Deep in the old pine forests of Bavaria there live a small sect of craftsmen who specialize in the ancient art of Beer Carving. For centuries now they've been creating their tiny Bavarian Hearts on the sudsy heads of ales and beers, creations so valuable/so fleeting that you can only have one made for you by visiting their alpine village and hiring one of them to carve for you and your Baby Mama right there in the town Bier-Haus. So, don't get any crazy ideas about faking this and doing one of these carvings yourself, man. She'll know it isn't genuine. And you'll pay the price.

I Heart You
 17 of 20


Very few Valentine gifts have the traditional timeless grace of the heart charm on a sleek chain. That heart around her neck says she knows love, and love knows her right back. It is, without a doubt, one of the finest gifts a man can present his Baby Mama at Valentine's Day. Unless, of course, he decides to put a little twist to the deal and offers her up one of these more realistic heart charms instead. In which case, it will look as if she is wearing a lump of exploded roadkill on her chest. Which is what every lady wants, no?

Worth Your Weight In Love
 18 of 20


Chocolates used to be pretty foolproof. There was a time when a box of bon-bon's was a one-way ticket to "At-Least-I-Didn't-Forget-Ville". But times have changed, man. So, something like this - a goofy chocolate gag involving her weight - although it might seem kind of funny, it's not. It's not funny at all. Trust me. You give her this and the cops are coming tonight.

Car Art
 19 of 20


Go ahead. Get a bar of soap and some of those specialty crayons and on the night before Valentine's Day secretly cover up her car with hearts and I Love U's. Then, next morning, while she's still in her robe: make her cover her eyes and lead her out to the garage or the curb. She'll be thinking: OMG, he got me a new car!!!!! And then you holler,"Surprise!" and she uncovers her eyes and the two of you are further away for each other than ever before.

Relax
 20 of 20


No, not champagne hot tub relax (although, if you take her there you rule). What I mean is: Valentine's Day shouldn't be as much pressure as I just made it all sound. Heck, I was just messing with you. Tell the woman in your life that you love her. Tell her that you need her. Bust out some gas station roses and maybe a bottle of 9 dollar vino. Just enjoy the day, but remember that Valentine's Day is just a once a year thing, so don't stress it at all. And seriously: don't let her see that you bought that heart-shaped steak.

You may be wondering why Bosh keeps claiming he doesnât live in Florida three years into his contract with the Heat? Because, as weâve previously reported, his baby mama, Allison Mathis is only getting $2,600-a-month in child support from him because of a ruling in Texas, which Bosh claims as his official residence. Via EurWeb: Had Bosh been found to be a Florida resident, heâd be looking at $30,000-a-month in child support for the next 15 years, reports Jose Lambietâs Gossip Extra.     The ruling comes as part of a three-year battle between Bosh and an ex-girlfriend over their three-year-old daughter. The Heater was married last year to Adrienne Bosh. They have an infant son.     But when he played for the Toronto Raptors, Bosh lived with Allison Mathis, who got pregnant through fertility treatment.     Jane Carey, Mathisâ attorney, called todayâs ruling a âmiscarriage of justiceâ and promised to appeal.     âEverybody knows that Texas is rough on horses and women,â Carey said. âNow, I guess that any young man in Florida who makes big money should get a Texas address before they have a baby.     âTheyâll save a lot of money that way.â     In August, the Dallas born-and-bred Bosh did appear before Orange County Circuit Court Judge Robert Evans and was grilled for two hours about his current residency. At the time, Carey stopped just short of calling him a liar.     At that hearing, Bosh admitted that, in order to get a mortgage to pay for his $12.5 million-Miami Beach home, he signed an affidavit swearing that the North Bay Road mansion would be his primary residence.     Bosh also fielded questions on why his name was purged from Texasâ voters lists.     But Judge Evans said he based his decision on one set of documents: Boshâs income-tax filings, sent to the IRS from Texas! Chris Bosh just made out like a fat kid in the candy shop. How do these guys keep skating on child support?  Neyoâs Ex Baby Mama Lost Her Mind: She Wants $ For Cheating On Him And Getting Pregnant With Another Manâs Baby LETâS CONNECT TWITTER INSTAGRAM LATEST BUZZ O.J. Simpson And Khloe Kardashian: Father And Daughter? Did You Know Gummy Worms Were This Gross? Jessica Simpson Still Struggling With Weight After Baby FACEBOOK FANS ARCHIVES  Do you remember the VH1 âBehind The Musicâ Episode with Neyo? I watched it feeling so good that my suspicions were true. Dude is a good guy. Have his Ex fake baby mama tell itâ¦he is a snake who needs to pay her more moneyâ¦.not really sure why thoâ? Here is the story, Jesseca White (not the model) was claiming that Ne-Yo was the father of her son when they were dating. When she first told him that she was pregnant; he was so excited about the baby and was really looking forward to having his first child. He was there was for the entire pregnancy and paid for everything along the way. But, she had a nasty secret. Shortly after the baby was born, she could no longer keep her secret.Â  She cried and finally admitted that the boy, Chimere, whom Neyo named after himself, was actually not his baby. Neyo was heartbroken and fell into a depression. He was so sad because he really loved this girl and was in love with the baby. Crazy thing is Neyoâs mom always had a feeling that baby was not his. She never liked Jesseca. But, Neyo was so blinded by his love that he could not hear it. A partenity test later proved that the boy was not Neyoâs baby. Being a true gentleman, Neyo paid her $575,000 and went ghost on her. As if that gesture was not enough, now, Jesseca hired Attorney Gloria Allred to get more money out of Neyo. She is claiming that he broke a confidentiality clause by talking about the paternity issue on the episode of VH1 âBehind The Music.â According to her Attorney, in a letter sent to TMZ:Â  âJesseca has been defamed, ridiculed and harassedâ¦ Jesseca has been unable to work, was forced to file for state aid, suffers from mental anguish and is beset by nausea, vomiting and hair loss.â Can you say thirsty female? This woman has no idea how lucky she is that Neyo did not turn his back on her after she cheated and made him think that he had a son who was not even his baby. Jesseca has the nerve to now ask Ne-Yo to settle the matter amicably out of court otherwise sheâll be âforced to pursue more serious legal options.â I am going to need Jesseca to go find a real job and something more productive to do with her time. If you were Neyo would you have paid her any money at all? Only  registered  users can comment.  Â© 2016 BoujiBuzz All Rights Reserved.

 Justin Bieber is having the last laugh. Mariah Yeater, 20, made headlines last fall when she claimed Bieber was the father of her baby and the singer is only just now laughing about it. Bieber, 18, tweeted on Saturday, "Dear mariah yeeterâ¦we have never metâ¦so from the heart i just wanted to sayâ¦" He then linked to a YouTube clip of Sacha Baron Cohen&apos;s Borat character repeating, "You will never get this. You will never get this. La la la la laâ¦"

 Yeater claimed in late October of last year that she became pregnant with Bieber&apos;s baby after a sexual encounter backstage his concert at the Staples Center in L.A. when she was 19 and Bieber was 16. The "baby" singer said he had never met Yeater and reportedly took a DNA test to prove her wrong.

 Yeater withdrew her lawsuit and Bieber&apos;s team said in a statement they would, "vigorously pursue all available legal remedies to protect Justin and hold those involved with bring this suit accountable for their actions." The tweet Bieber addressed to Yeater (though he spelled her name wrong) was part of his "Random Twitter Hour" on Saturday.  He tweeted anything and everything that came to mind including, "Kinda weirded out that no one got the secret meaning of #boyfriend Obviously listening closely you can tell its about the migration of birds."

All Rights Reserved. All Rights Reserved Powered by WordPress.com VIP 3 years ago Singer Ne-Yo is having to deal with former baby mama Jesseca White yet again. The ex-gal pal has hiredÂ âevery manâs nightmare and every womanâs fantasyâ attorney Gloria Allred to assist her in possibly takingÂ the crooner to the cleaners. White is reportedly incensed that Ne-Yo publicly discussed their agreement to keep secret his non-paternity status about a baby White though she had with the singer. The story is a complicated one. Ne-Yo and White had a baby in 2009 and he thought the child was his at first but, in fact, it turned out that it wasnât. Ne-Yo and his ex agreed to remove his name from the childâs birth certificate. The former loversÂ also settled the matter to the tune of $575,000, which he reportedly handed over to her and they both agreed to keep the entire incident under lock and key, never to discuss it with anyone. In September 2012, Ne-Yo appeared on âBehind the Music,â where he opened upÂ the can of beans about the entire ugly drama that involved his non-paternity status with White. Bad move!Â  What about the agreement? Now Allred has allegedly sent Ne-Yo a letter stating that his public account of what took place with regards to the paternity matter with White has rockedÂ the young womanâsÂ world. AllredÂ claims that White is unable to find work, has filed for state aid, suffers from mental anguish and is âbeset by nausea, vomiting and hair lossâ because of Ne-Yoâs blabbing about their past relationship. White is now asking for an unspecifiedÂ out-of-court settlement or else sheâll take her legal threats a huge step further.  From <a href="http://hellobeautiful.com/2015/12/22/sandra-bland-family-non-indictment/" target="_blank"><strong>Sandra Bland</strong></a> to the shootings in <a href="http://hellobeautiful.com/2015/06/20/why-is-south-carolina-using-a-judge-in-the-charleston-church-massacre-who-has-used-the-n-word-before/" target="_blank">Charleston, South Carolina</a>, African Americans were sadly reminded that being <a href="http://hellobeautiful.com/2015/12/13/police-brutality-2015/" target="_blank">Black in America</a> is much harder than it ought to be. And yet in the same breath, 2015 was a year of Black joy during whichÂ our culture dominated not only in our lives, but in the mainstream consciousness. From <a href="http://hellobeautiful.com/2015/07/16/lee-daniels-and-taraji-p-henson-emmy-empire/" target="_blank">Cookie Lyons</a> to the <a href="http://hellobeautiful.com/2015/10/17/ebony-editor-comments-cosby-cover/" target="_blank">Cosby <em>Ebony </em>cover</a>, our brilliance helped to push the conversation, affirm our greatness, make history and most important, make us laugh.

 A month after it was revealed that she fathered a love child with Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Sperminator's low-key housekeeper is finally talking. In a sit-down with Hello! magazine, Mildred Baena said that when she first told her now-13-year-old son that his real dad was none other than Schwarzenegger, his response was short and sweet: "Cool!" You get the feeling there's a part for him in the next Terminator film? MORE: Arnold and His Mistress: A Timeline of a Scandal The Guatemalan-born domestic worker also set the record straight about when she first realized Schwarzenegger was the father and how estranged wife Maria Shriver found out about thei extramarital affair. "It was as [my son] grew and I started to see the resemblance that I wonderedâbut it became more apparent as time went on," said Baena, a mother of three who was married at the time she and Schwarzenegger were getting it on. She divorced shortly after her son's birth. Baena, who worked in the Schwarzenegger household for 20 years and had a close relationship with the family, said that when she brought her son to the Schwarzenegger home one summer, a number of people commented on his resemblance to Arnold, but it was finally Shriver who broached the subject of her betrayal and her hubby pumping a little more than iron. "She would say things like, 'I'm here if you need to talk.' I sensed something was up. I have so much love and respect for Maria," Baena said. "Finally, she asked point blank." At that point, Baena broke down and confessed, but to her shock and amazement, instead of anger, she recalled that her boss was surprisingly compassionateâespecially given Shriver was pregnant with her and Schwarzenegger's son Christopher at the same time Mildred was pregnant (the two boys were born three weeks apart). "She was so strong. She cried with me and told me to get off my knees. We held each other and I told her it wasn't Arnie's fault, that it takes two," Baena said. Schwarzenegger has since taken responsibility, buying Baena and her son a house in Bakersfield and helping them financially. After the scandal broke, the illegitimate baby mama remained tight-lipped about their affair and went into hiding. But now that their secret is out, a contrite Baena has nothing but sympathy for Schwarzenegger. "He's a good man and I know he's suffering too. He loves Maria. I hope with time they work things out," she said. Better late than never.

									My boyfriends ex wife is a drama queen it got a little better when we moved 5 hours away. They have been divorced for 6 years after a 2 year marriage and they had a great co parenting relationship till I came in the picture 3 years ago. She doesn't like that I am 10 years younger and bi racial.  She doesn't believe in people dating outside their race and has said to my face bi racial people are an abomination . Now we are moving closer like 45 mins closer and the drama is starting up again.... I think it's going to be worse now that I am pregnant my boyfriend is a great dad she will be the first to tell you she hates him with me... She has had a boyfriend but when that fizzled out she started the drama again... Just venting

									We have been fighting with my husbands ex wife for 2 years. She is an NIGHTMARE. It's not as bad when she's in a relationship but when she's single and miserable she does whatever she can to disrupt our lives and act like a lunatic. I'm tired of spending money on lawyers to force her to adhere to the visitation agreement, i'm tired of doing damage control for the rumors and lies she spreads about us. She uses my stepdaughter to get back at us and I'm over it. She even took my sd to the beach on the day of our wedding so she couldn't be in the wedding. She pulled the same stunt on the day that we had a huge birthday party planned for my sd. DH and my brother went to pick her up 3 hours before the party started and he kept knocking on the door and she wouldn't answer. They sat in the driveway trying to call her and find out what was going on and the cops showed up. She had called them from the neighbors house saying that she felt threatened by him. Wtf. I'm over the whole damn situation and I would absolutely wash my hands of the whole thing if i could.

									Sounds like his ex. It was his wkend which happened to be his birthday agreed to let him have her sending text saying daughter is ready he gets there and she isn't their and sends a pic with them at putt putt saying have a great birthday she did something similar on fathers day last year.  I could go on and on. I wish I could wash my hands but I love my boyfriend way to much. My parents were divorced and they didn't like each other but never put my brother and I in the middle like that so I don't understand parents who do that.

									My dh and I have been together 5 years and his ex still plays those games with the kids.  The kids are older and see what she does, but she is their BM so they do feel awkward about it.  Best advice?  Be as happy as possible and find a way to make the best of whatever drama she tries to bring your way.  She still says things here and there but we killed her with kindness and it helps us sleep at night.  Also, check out the book divorce poison if you start having issues with the kids.  It saved our family

									Kill em with kindness! Worst thing u can do is talk bad about kid's bm infront of the kid... Even though she's a witch she is still the mother.  When the kids get older, they will remember u were more civilized rather than the crazy lady! As for the whole bi-racial thing, just ignore her stupidity! I bet baby's stepsibling will be really excited to have a little brother or sister no matter what race!

Hereâs How to Avoid Itâ¦ Popular Stories MadameNoire Video madamenoire.com Try Not to Take It Personally There should be no reason for your manâs ex and his childâs mother to hate you. After all, unless he cheated on her with you, thereâs no reason for her to spew hate your way, right? If only it were that simple, but itâs not that easy. Most women who have a manâs child probably thought theyâd marry him. They may have even gotten pregnant purposely in order to âkeepâ him. If she loved him, and still does love him, she probably doesnât like you because sheâs a bitter ex harboring ill feelings; and because she canât have him and hasnât moved on, she focuses her resentment towards you. Thereâs nothing you can do about that except ignore her and try not to take it personally. You may ask your man about the relationship and how it ended, but at the end of the day, his version and her version of the relationship will always be different, so trying to understand why she doesnât like you might be futile. Just try your best to keep your distance and allow her time to get over it. Sometimes these things just donât make any sense, so trying to make sense of it will only make you crazy. my partner and I have been trying for a baby for over two years now, We were going to a fertility clinic for about 5 months before somebody told us to contact this spell caster who is so powerful, We contacted him at this email; babaka.wolf@gmail.com , for him to help us, then we told him our problem, he told us that we will either conceive in February 2014 or March 2014,but after two years of trying we were at a point where we were willing to try anything. And Iâm glad we came to Priest  Babaka, Because his pregnancy spell cast put us at ease, and I honestly believe him, and his gods really helped us as well, I am thankful for all he has done. contact him via email: babaka.wolf@gmail.com if you are trying to get a baby or want your lover back. he has powers to do it, he has done mine I am in a relationship withathe love of my life I love him so much and he loves me two but he have 2 kids with this crazy woman that drives me totally crazy and I feel like I am ready to gave up forever but every time I try to let him go he dont let me its been 5 years of nothing but stress and drama I dont know what else to do should I go or should I stay I would not date a man with children. When a man tells me he has kids, he gets approximately 1 minute of my time after that.  I let him know this will probably never turn in to more. Iâve met plenty of guys with no kids than to settle for this BS drama..Sorry! and Iâm 29, men w/ no kids do exist, ladies.  I once had a guy to try to talk to me and we was getting along great until he dropped a bomb. He said he had no kids but he did. His daughter was being born the next day on day two of us talking. He said his baby mama had moved and she was acting funny to him. I ran faster than the roadrunner and let him know that his focus should be on his newborn and not on some new booty that he isnt going to get. He did his rant on black women not being understanding of his situation (yes he really did, the kicker is that his baby mama had a girl.) That was in February. He now has some white girl 5 months preg with a boy (so he basically had unprotected sex with another woman while his first kid was only two months and yet complained how his baby mama wouldnt let him keep her). smdh they both trashed his other baby mama on facebook. Im soo glad I meep meep like the road runner out of that messiness. I guess for some reason the moderators didnât like my other post about this. But there is actual a BM syndrome (Divorce Related Malicious Mother Syndrome): A mother who unjustifiably punishes her divorcing or divorced husband by:Attempting to alienate their mutual child(ren) from the fatherInvolving others in malicious actions against the fatherEngaging in excessive litigationThe mother specifically attempts to deny her child(ren):Regular uninterrupted visitation with the fatherUninhibited telephone access to the fatherpaternal participation in the child(ren)âs school life and extra-curricular activitiesTile pattern is pervasive and includes malicious acts towards the husband including:Lying to the childrenLying to othersViolations of lawThe disorder is not specifically due to another mental disorder although a separate mental disorder may co-exist. Uhâ¦correction.  Is this REALLY about a malicious baby mama?  Or, does the fault lie with a trifling man that is all about his needs over his wife, woman, or child he should be committed to the welfare of taking care of?  What is the technical term for these men?  I could think of a few, actually. While I do not begrudge a dude for having a past, I also have a right not to have his baby mama in my future. When things are the best between you and your S.O. those chickens come home to roost. She may lay low if she thinks you all are just kicking it but if you get something from him that she never had like say a proposal sheâll manifest. When you marry, do not be surprised if she blows a head gasket even if sheâs halfway across the country. He wonât shut it down right away because itâs like a subtle stroke to his ego. His ego goes, âIf she acting like this I must have really put it on her.â Act 2: if you go off on a tangent the plot just thickens. She acts up, you react, he steps in when if heâd just step up in the first place he could just nip it in the bud you wouldnât have so much residual to deal with. Baby mamas may be a lot like drugs, âJust say no!â A baby mama is like new growth no matter how you relax and color theyâre going to show up. Donât start no stuff wonât be no stuff. Let the church say amen! As I am getting older, I donât have time to play games. Life is too short. It would be nice and ideal if things didnât work out, exes could be civil with one another but more often than not, that isnât the case. Thatâs why it is even more important for both parties in a relationship to use protection if they are not married. Itâs not fair to child to grow up without both parents together taking care of them. People need to stop being so non-chalant with sex and understand all the variables it holds(STDâs, pregnancies, hurt feelings, etc.) LOL youâre right.  The only time you have baby mama drama is when one (or both) of them have not truly let go. If there wasnât still inappropriate feelings still involved 99% of the drama wouldnât exist. The man shouldnât move on until that ish is over and done with or HE should check that ish AS SOON AS it gets outta line. Most men donât do that. I could go on and on about how disrespectful these baby mamaâs are out here but that would start a riot!! LMAO If youâre under 35, then itâs definitely possible to opt to date only childless men and women. But as you get older, then the chances that youâll find someone whoâs never been married or in a LTR are pretty slim. These baby mama tips also apply to ex-wives. More reason to expand to other races as you get older. Itâs not like that everywhere. There are some men who manage not to have children even if theyâre in their 40s or 50s.  Co-sign on this.  A lot has to do with acceptable norms in different races.  If you donât want to deal with a man with kids at 35+, you might need to explore âotherâ racial options.  Not everyone man is down with having a baby mama or two, etcâ¦. One thing Iâve noticed with the whole baby mama drama thing is that many times, the true drama ends up involving the new girlfriend and the baby mama and not the DADDY! The daddy will sit back and let you two go at it, while he just calls her âcrazy.â  this is what really gets me! All the more reason to leave that type of dude in the first place. The solution to this problem seems very simple to me.  If youâre dating a man with kids, and his ex shows the slightest bit of crazy, run in the other direction (meep-meep!)  You can tell a lot about a person by their dating past, as well as by the way that they treat their exes who have their children.  But if a man has such a wild woman as his baby mama, thereâs a part of me that will wonder what drew them together in the first place.  And I agree that a lot of this mess could be avoided if people made better, more thoughtful decisions about who to get involved with.  At the same time however, there are so many women who are scared away from being a stepmother (and understandably so) because they donât want to deal with this, and the kids are the ones that miss out.  Although there are some insane women out there, I donât think that people should rule out dating someone with kids, because all situations arenât the same.  Anyway, the advice in this article is great. âIf youâre dating a man with kids, and his ex shows the slightest bit of crazy, run in the other direction (meep-meep!)â âBut if a man has such a wild woman as his baby mama, thereâs a part of me that will wonder what drew them together in the first place.â âAlthough there are some insane women out there, I donât think that people should rule out dating someone with kids, because all situations arenât the same. Anyway, the advice in this article is great.â In all three of those statements, you specifically label the woman as the problem, whether it be because she is âcrazyâ, âwildâ, or âinsaneâ. I also prefer to not date a man with children. I donât have any children and Iâm not looking for a ready-made family. However, if I do choose to get involved, it will be with someone who has one child by one woman and he has to have a respectful, civil relationship with her. If I even sense any drama, I wonât hesitate to leave. Been there and done thatâ¦. Iâm right there with you. Exactly! If u have kids early then grow up and move on then ususally u accept a partner with kids because u have them but some baby mommas are just jealous and miserable because the daddy stepped his game up. I say pray and make sure you are not being disrespected. Stupid babymomma usually run out of options. Make better choices in men and you wonât have baby mama drama. Make better choices in men and you wonât have baby mama drama. Telling that to most b/w is like telling them to do brain surgery with no training. THIS!!! I agree to a certain degree. Some men have 2 or 3 baby mamas & just effâd up all around. Run from them! But if men make better choices in your sexual escapes (like using protection) and you wonât have babies. But since this is the topic weâre on, it is a manâs responsibility to step up and take control of a situation like this. This can not be blame on a woman who  is wanting to settle down. For the most part, you donât know thereâs drama until later.  Typical.  Tell women what they need to do while never addressing the behavior in men. I didnât even have to read the article to tell you the best way to avoid it is to get married to a decent man first and then have his children or if he already has kids, make sure he has a good relationship with the mother of his kids before you start dating. . .  Page 3 is the kicker! Let him do the talkingâ¦.but if he doesnât and just let the baby momma talk to you any ol kinda wayâ¦.itâs hard not to defend yourself. I guess you have to just love yourself enough to know itâs time to go at that point! (talking to myself) If you are just a girlfriend while the baby momma disrespects you then itâs time to let that relationship go if it happens more than once. If you are the wife, you are permanent fixture and need to let it be known that you, her, and him will need to come together to successfully co-parents the kids. After all, it is about the best interest of the child NOT PEOPLEâS HURT FEELINGS. Just my opinion. You wanna know how I avoid it?By not getting with a man with kids!!Thereâs still alot out there.I completely stop talking to a guy if he has kids shallow maybe but Iâm 21 years old and a college student why should I settle for a man that already began a familyâ¦I canât deal with the jealousy and the competition. of course you are 21. some college aged adults arent even responsible enough to go to class much less work on a consistent basis. so what makes anybody think theyâll have a sensible relationship with someone? Your friends/spouses/boyfriends are fragments of you. it just that we cant see their faults as our own too. find the right person whether they be with or without children. youâll know whoâs worth your time. Yea I feel you..I just donât want a guy with kids because most of the time the baby mama and them still have something going on and they obviously had sex without a condom so either they were serious or he was just plain irresponsible. Mouthful said right here! You are NOT shallow. You are on the money. Just donât let these folks out here make you feel bad for having this standard. I had people make me feel like I was scum of the earth for having just doubts about dating a man with kid(s).  My favorite comment from them- âdonât fault him for having kids. If you had children, you wouldnât want someone to treat you like that.â Treat him like what, lol?  Well, after several experiences of giving these complexed relationships a try, I am like âwhatever!â Life is already complicated, I donât need a manâs baby mama drama. Dude should handle that mess before starting a new relationship anyway. Better yet, try to work it out with her- youâve already created a family anyway. Ikr I donât need that in my life! @chakakhanian:disqus
^^this!!!! Yes!!! I once had a friend tell me how I was so selfish because I didnt date men with kids and needed to get use to most men having one kid (even if they didnt tell you about it) at our age of 24. smdh She on the other hand only dated men with no kids because she wanted her kids to come first with the man and for him to treat hers as his and felt it was okay for her with 3 kids to diss men with kids and complain about how he would treat her kids second to his kids.. She hopped from childless man to child less man and had 3 kids by each childless one. Well she got married to a man without kids and they have a kid together. He posts pics of the kid he has with her (only one) while she posts pics of all 4 of her kids. Kinda ironic isnt it? Your friends told you not to fault him for having children while they would probably turn around and fault a woman for having children. Even if all is well now, if yâall last thereâs a stage
disguising its self as graduation, weddings, holidays, spring break, and summer vacations  where the curtains are drawn back and the drama unfolds. At 21 youâre right you donât need an instant family.  But if you are still single when you are 30 plus the likelihood of a man not having kids/ex shrinks considerably.  I never knowingly dated a man with kids, I donât have any so why should I bother. But good luck to the women that do. I thought this was a good article. I lot of it is from common sense and wisdom. Just confirms that you it takes a lot of love, patience and being secure in who you are to be involved with someone who has kids. If the other party is serious about pursuing a relationship with you, I advise to inquire as much as you can about his/her involvement with the ex so you know up front where things stand. Most women like this donât have parental problems with the man, they have personal problems and oddly seek acknowledgment and validation from the childâs father. i read the first 2 and then stopped.
i figured if i donât have kids iâm better off dating someone with no kids. CO-SIGN! Iâm glad I never have that baby mama drama, I have a daughter with my ex husband but him and my fiance (who has no kids yet) get along well. But I knew women who had the baby mama drama, even my cousin. She started dating her boyfriend and his baby mama would spread rumors about her having AIDS and my cousin didnât do anything, the baby mama started hatin on my cousin ASAP.

  Vicki Gunvalson has received plenty of backlash since engaging in a relationship with Brooks Ayers. Ayersâ dirtyÂ laundryÂ was broadcast on the internet shortly after they began dating and fans were shocked at what they saw. Ayers is a dead beat dad who owes child support to the mother of his children. He was even thrown behind bars for his lack of payment. After all the negative things she said about Slade, how could she date someone like that? Now, Ayersâ baby mama is dishing even more to the press. Nicolette Catanzarite, the mother of Ayersâ three-year-old son, is speaking to ABCâsÂ 20/20, and not holding back. âHe has not supported his child. He bailed on the hospital bill, the pediatrician bill, and left me with all of it.â  âI met Brooks in 2007 in Atlanta on a golf trip and he was just kind of a Southern charmer without a doubt.â Catanzarite said. âHe did mention he was going through a divorce and was legally separated and that he had three children.Â It wasnât appropriate that he would ask me to marry him while he was still married so he gave me a promise ring.â Catanzarite also revealed that when they first began their relationship, Ayers claimed to not want anymore children and even told her he had a vasectomy. However,Â a few months later, Catanzarite found out she was pregnant.Â Soon after their sonâs birth, Ayers disappeared and hasnât been in their sonâs life since. âNo birthdays, no cards for Christmas, no phone calls, nothing,â Catanzarite said. Two years ago, she filed for child support and Ayers was ordered to pay her $700 per month, which she says she hasnât been getting. Ayers was even arrested for his failure to pay. Ayers denies all of Catanzariteâs claims. âI speak to my kids every day,â Ayers recently said during a recent interview, and his girlfriend Vicki is standing by him. Hopefully, Vicki wonât blame Tamra for this! UPDATE â Watch the 20/20 clip and see more photos of Nicolette Catanzarite (with and without Brooks Ayers) here!

// ]]&gt;  No surprise there. How is Vicky going to âspin thisâ ? Well, he rented her a fur coat so he MUST be rich. -head desk- CORRECTIONâ¦. He didnât rent it.  He paid for it with the credit card that SHE gave HIMâ¦ Love is not only blind, but it makes you insane.  That was how Vicki behaved when Tamra ripped Babbling Brooks a new one for causing friction over an eye roll.  Vicki went postal (her voice deepened lower than Linda Blairâs in the Exorcist) as she chastised both Tamra and Briana for a man who looks and moves like a doddering old coot.  (I canât believe heâs 45 when he looks over 60!) I REFUSE to believe that heâs 45.  He looks like hot garbage. So is she going to blame Tamara for this one too? Crooks isnt speaking out on the 20/20 interview..but he has changed his twitter profile picture tohim holding a baby boy. I guess that changes everythingâ¦LOLâ¦LOLâ¦NOT! Stop spamming all these sites witth your ignorant views and opinions. You and your deadbeat are as stupid as Vicki and hers. Fur coat = âjoint checking accountâ  So Vicky paid for the coat, Brooks just picked it out.  As smart as Vicky is, she really thinks the people around her are stupid.  I feel sorry for her kids. I donât understand  why a woman is so willing to have unprotected sex, leaving herself open to a pregnancy that is clearly unwanted by the father as well as subjecting herself to any stdâs from a man she really didnât know. Yes, he said he had a vasectomy, and he clearly said he didnât want any more children. Now, if you go ahead and get knocked up, the man should not have to pay for the next 18 years or more. Women need to stop doing this to men and to the children they bear for the sake of padding their pockets I do not understand why a MAN is so willing to have unprotected sex, leaving himself open to impregnating, STD and lying about his ability to impregnate(and his intentions).  If you go ahead and knock someone up SHE should not have to pay for the next 18 years(and not just in currency but her lifestyle). MEN need to stop doing this and simply put on a condom!!!

RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR 1 COMMENT MOST POPULAR HOT NEWS POPULAR POSTS POPULAR CATEGORY I recently read an article that was supposed to big up the Black father. The articleâs title (something along the lines of âBlack Men as Deadbeats is a Mythâ) suggested, at least to me, that this would be a story of a man or men who go through hell and high water to be just as active in their childrenâs lives as their mothers, or, better still, Black fathers who are the primary caretakers of their children, or, even better, the fact (yes, FACT) that the statistics and media propaganda of the deadbeat Black father is just false (I have, recently, read such an article). Instead, though, this story was all about how a Black man videotaped his desperate pleas to his angry and belligerent babyâs mama to see his son who, despite the knowledge that her actions were being recorded, refused him access to their child. The old story (however true in however many cases) that further divides Black mother and father and entrenches us in the narrative of Baby Mama and Daddy. I am sick as hell of that story. I am what would be called a âBaby Mama.â I do not relish in, nor do I even LIKE this term. This term conjures up images of Welfare Queens who take care of themselves before their children and do all that they can to make the father of those children miserable. This is not who I am. This is not my story. Neither is it the story of MOST Black parents, married or not. The father of my child and I have a very good and loving relationship (even if it was hard fought, the point being we FOUGHT for it). We have our issues (hence, we are not married), but we work them out and all for the sake of our three year old little girl. I tell you these things, not because we are the exception, but because we are the rule. Most families like ours are, at least, semi-functional. Keeping it real, ALL families are ONLY about semi-functional! I am his childâs mother. He is my childâs father. We are a family, if a non-traditional one. I am all too familiar with the propagation of the Black man as deadbeat. A man unwilling to, if not incapable of, not making multiple children with multiple women nor taking care of those women and children. Lately, there has been an influx of articles, surveys and studies proving this image a myth (read: outright lie). However, along with the positive uplifting of our Black fathers , has come the disparaging and diminishing of the image of the Black mother (as is usually the case with our people). Time and time again, site after site, article after article, Black men (and women) have gone to war against the single, Black mother. Commonplace are the phrases, âyou canât trust no woman these days,â âthese women just wanna get a nâa for his check,â âyou know these chicks ainât no good,â etcetera. And Black people via facebook, blogs and news media are feeding into this. Even those who call themselves âpro-Black,â âconscious,â or âPan-Afrikanistâ are fanning this ridiculous, Black woman bashing flame- supposedly, in the name of repairing the name and image of the Black father. However, it only tears us apart and hurts our babies. The problem in the Black community is that we have failed to behave as a COMMUNITY! The solutions to our problems do not lie within the blame placing and shaming of one another (put down light skinned folks to uplift dark skinned folks, put down women to uplift men, put down mothers to uplift fathers). We are not our enemy! The divide between Black men and women started well before the courts, the government and the media made it look (emphasis here) profitable for us, the oppressed, to oppress one another. To degrade one for the upliftment of the other only furthers the systemic, insidious disease that is the plight of the Black man and woman in america and around the world. We must begin to choose an attitude of love toward one another, regardless of our differences and personal squabbles. We spend so much time trying to prove each other wrong and trying to trace the origin of the breakdown in our relationships to one side of us, the victimized, or the other. We get so caught up in trying not to look stupid or foolish for letting someone take advantage of our kindness, that we end up being just plain mean to each other and our children suffer. Let me let you in on a little secret: all of the same emotions that helped you make the child should have some place in helping you raise that child, whether you are together or not (if you had a one night stand, you liked that person for at LEAST 30 secondsâ¦ work it out!). This is something that my childâs dad and I, both have to remind ourselves of when things get tough. And because of this, I have that manâs back- good or bad, right or wrong, happy or mad- and he has mine. It will always be that way because we will always share a bond that is the most precious that any two people can share: a child. We have an awesome responsibility. Our child loves and adores the both of us. I will not allow any negativity (from ANYONE) to tarnish her image of her dad, no matter what the current or past circumstance may look like. We mess up, we fight (privately and AWAY from our child), we get over it. Such is life. We will not feed into the old narrative. I urge all of the âbaby mamasâ and âbaby daddiesâ to do the same. For the sake of the children. Great article, Monique! Thanks you! Comments are closed.

 From partying to pacifiers, DJ Pauly D is about to transition from a New Jersey party animal into the role of a hair gel-happy dad. On Oct. 22 it was revealed that the 33-year-old former Jersey Shore star had a secret love child, a baby girl who was the result of a one night stand in Las Vegas.Â  TMZ has since revealed that Pauly D (real name: Paul DelVecchio) is the father of a five-month-old baby girl named Amabella and his baby mama is former Hooters waitress and current VIP hostess Amanda Markert.Â

  Ne-Yo Gets Stung With Defamation Lawsuit By âFakeâ Baby Mama, Jesseca White Popular Stories MadameNoire Video Source: WENN Back in December, we told you that a woman by the name of Jesseca White was threatening to sue Grammy Award-winning singer and songwriter, Ne-Yo. In case youâre unaware of who Jesseca White is, allow me to catch you up to speed. A few years ago Ne-Yo and Jesseca dated. During this time, White gave birth to a child whom Ne-Yo believed that he fathered. Shockingly, in 2009 he found out Maury Povich-style that he was not the father. In September of 2012 the âLet Me Love Youâ singer appeared on a VH1 Behind The Music special, where at some point he discussed the traumatic ordeal and finding out the baby wasnât his. âJessica called me, balling crying. Iâm like, âWhatâs wrong with you?â And all she could say is, âHeâs not yours, heâs not yours.â She just kept saying it over and over and over again, to the point where I droppedÂ the phone. Chimereâs not mine. That hurt âcause I had attached myself to this guy, you know. This is my son. Iâm looking at him and Iâm picturing Iâm gonna be old, and heâs gonna be â this is my son! Itâs not my son,â he said during the special. A few months following the showâs airing, Jesseca hired an attorney and threatened to sue Ne-Yo, claiming that his depicting her asÂ âa harlot who lied, broke his heart and then vanished,â was defaming and caused her to become the subject of much ridicule and harassment. She also claimed that she was so distraught and mentally tortured over Ne-Yoâs comments that she was unable to work, forced to file for state aid and suffered intenseÂ ânausea, vomiting and hair loss.â It was expressed that White hoped that she and Ne-Yo could settle amicably, but if he didnât pay up, sheâd be forced to sue him. It appears that Ne-Yo hasnât complied because TMZ is reporting that White is moving forward with legal proceedings. In her lawsuit, she claims that Ne-Yo depicted her asÂ âan unchaste woman who deliberately tricked him into believing he was the father of her child â¦ so that she could fraudulently bilk him of âungodly amounts of money.'â She also claims that she didnât âtrickâ the singer, but at the time she gave birth, she wasnât sure if he was the father and that Ne-Yo made it seem as if she âaggressivelyâ sought to deceive him. White says that her career as a photographer and graphic designer has been drastically impacted since Ne-Yoâs special. While Jessecaâs claims seem a bit outrageous, when she finally revealed to Ne-Yo that he was not her childâs father, the two reached a settlement agreement where he paid her $575,000. It is reported that the two also agreed to a confidentiality clause, in which both parties vowed to never go public with certain information regarding the paternity drama. And this is why Jesseca just might have a case.
Messy. What are your thoughts on this? Should Ne-Yo have to pay Jesseca? Â  Follow Jazmine on TwitterÂ @jazminedenise. He shouldnât have to pay her a dime for fraud.  She deliberately lied to bulk him out of money.  Itâs so sad for the child but this woman deserves nothing. I hope the judge rules in Neyoâs favor. Enough is enough. This is the first time EVER where Iâve heard of a woman fooling a man into thinking a child is his AND making him pay her CHILD SUPPORT for a child that isnât his after the truth came to light. Now she wants to take him for another pay dayâ¦Sheâs ridiculous. Her livelihood has been at the hands of this manâs hard earned money. Confidentiality clause my behind, he has a right to tell details about HIS LIFE if he so chooses. He did not defame her, he simply stated his truth, which happened to involve her. If she didnât want anyone to know about it she shouldnât have done it. This broad is SAD.  You should look up child support laws, in many states this is the way it goes even if a man isnât the biological father. They have until the age of 2 and after that itâs nearly impossible to get a child support order reversed. Personally, I donât understand the nerve of women who ask for itâ¦ Thats horrible it truly is. I can say that Iâm a woman who put my childâs father on child support. We split up and he left me in a situation where he was not contributing to his childâs life. I had lots of nerve behind it and still stick by my decision. I didnât get a dime until the state made him pay. You absolutely should get child support from your childâs father. But the ones I find issue with are the ones who seek support knowing good and well that a man is not the father. Even if the law technically recognizes the wrong man as such, it just doesnât seem right to keep after him. I agree with you. Laws are so screwed up. For that very reason, even thought I was COMPLETELY faithful to my boyfriend, I told him to get the test while we were in the hospital just to ease him mind. I encouraged it, just for my own kicks and giggles..I do believe that men need to take advantage of that quick and easy paternity test before the child even leaves the hospital. Its FREE and everybody is already gathered there together. Married or not, men should just protect themselves in these situations. Sheâs truly trifling, females KNOW they done messed around but somehow in their mind think that they can âwishâ a baby into being who they WANT it to be by. Not child support.  Sheâs seeking money for damages for exposing her as a loosey goosey Maury Povich hall of famer. I know that sheâs not after him for child support now. What Iâm saying is she went after him for child support AFTER they both knew he was not the father. The girl just wants the money. hmmm I didnât read that in THIS story.  What it sounds like is she asked for child support and when a DNA test came back he was declared not the father. And she ran crying embarrassed off stage left. I guess it would depend on what information he wasnât allowed to talk about. He didnât reveal the amount of money, he just told the story. And I didnât get the impression that he thought she intentionally misled him. It just seemed like he said that the baby was tested and it wasnât his. But he claimed him another manâs child as his. This chick has some nerve, suing Ne-yo for some child support to support a child thatâs not even his (gotta love Cali for that law). Then disappearing without a trace after getting the money. She doesnât deserve another dime, she didnât deserve anything in the first placeâ¦ World & Country know that Neyo can sit on a lollipop and tell you what flavor it is. So he broke the confidentiality clause? Not smart. He should have kept his mouth shut like she did and she wouldnât get anything. I feel for him with the child not being his (so dirty) but you have to keep it legal. keeping it legal? in that case she never should have lied or accepted his cash to begin with . . . And yâall keep wondering why a lot of black men donât fux with black women. Because you all are always money hungry hoes with yâall hands trying to get into a negroâs pocket. Black women stay losing if its H.I.V., single parenting, rape etc. Shut Up. You couldnât wait to drop the black women bomb lol. Is that comment supposed to hurt black womenâs feelings? Smh His fiance is Black, so evidently dealing with one bad apple didnât turn him off an entire race of women, which is how someone with common sense approaches life. Takes two to spread HIV, takes two to make a single parent dunno what youâre talking about with the rape.  Whatâs your point? I blame the black fathers for not sticking around to help raise their daughterâs properly.  Other races of men overwhelmingly stick around to help raise their kids.  Whatâs wrong with yâall black dudes though? First off I personally think Neyo is a gay man pretending to be straight.  In the article it clearly says that when she found out he wasnât the father she told him, she didnât keep it from him.  They signed an agreement, he didnât honor it.  He should pay!  Stop calling this woman a hoe!  You donât know her or Neyo! You sleep with at least two men unprotected, within a two week time period . . .. .equals h*e-like behavior to me.  *shrugs* call a spade a spade  . . . I donât know why I find this story hilarious. Iâve always thought Ne-yo was a âHow you doin?â lmao! Forget the drama, what stuck out the most to me was that childâs name. THIS IS RIDICULOUS! When will African-Americans stop this? The childâs name is Chimere. A (Chimera) is a lion with a goat head attached to itâs back and a snake as a tail from Greek Mythology. To top it off, I âthinkâ the creature is female, not male. They even use the word today when scientists merge genetic material from two distinct animals.  I assume she didnât know any of this when naming her son.  And no, changing the a to an e doesnât make a difference and it still has the same pronunciation. OMG.. I hate this stupidity. Oh small minded oneâ¦. Chimere is a Nigerian name which means God givesâ¦ understand that words like bowl, plate etc have various meanings depending on the context. While some people do go to extremes with naming their children it isnt exclusive to âAfrican Americansâ  Its sad that thatâs the only thing that you took from the article. Please locate the nearest seat and google where you can find a clue! SMH The article was a little boring but Iâm laughing at that chicks âeducationalâ point of view. Iâm guessing Google was her source lol  She named her son Chimere because that is Ne-Yoâs middle name and at the time of his birth she thought it was his son. So basically she just named him after his âfatherâ. Nothing is wrong with that until the paternity test of course. I just want to know what did she do with the $575 he gave her! Sounds like if she had to go on state aid they need to sue her for a DAMN over payment for receiving public assistance! Hell noâ¦.thatâs all From the looks of it she was already paid. You canât just go around suing people because you canât keep your legs close and got exposed. Defamation of character? She should sue herself lol. Let me get this straight, she hot excited cuz she thought she hit bank by getting pregnant by a celeb, embarassed herself by exposing herself as a hoe, and now she suing cuz she embarassed herself? If only I didnât have morals or valuesâ¦*sigh*â¦ she should owe him money for not disclosing that she was in doubt of his paternity at the time she had the child. By her own admission she knowingly deceived that man for years while accepting child support from him. smh Hoes stay winning I swear. She doesnât deserve a dime! And Neyo gave her a lump sum which she has depleted from what I hear. He didnât slander or lie on her. Neyo told his story. She lied to that man and then asked him fund and feed a child that wasnât his. I hate dead beat fathers, but I can stand conniving and greedy women. You want to collect money for your  pain and suffering, find your childâs father. I 100% agree with you but if he signed a confidentiality agreement he might have to pay up! I saw the VH1 special its is so clear that he will never get over what she did to him SMH. I hope she doesnt get a dime! Okaaaaay!!! I donât understand how she has the nerve to want any more money from this guy after he gave her half a million dollars for a child that is not his. Crazy!

LaquettaÂ Theus (pictured left) is the latest alleged baby mama to claim that the iconic former NBA player Michael Jordan (pictured) fathered her 2-year-old girl, according to TMZ. RELATED: Judge Orders M.J.âs Fake Baby Mama To Pay Him Thousands For Bogus Paternity Claim Theus reportedly filed paternity suit documents at a Georgia court and is seeking child support, contending that the legendary player is indeed the Father of her baby girl, Juyana Rachelle Henderson. Theus even reportedly postedÂ a message onÂ her Facebook pageÂ for his Airness that read: Â Michael Jordan, when are you going to support your 2-year-old daughter? YouÂ  drop 10 million on your nice wedding â¦ that was nice but donât you think itÂ  time that you support your daughter? TheusÂ is the second woman to publicly come forth involving a paternity suit against Jordan.Â  Former wannabe baby mama Pamela Smith also came out of the woodwork earlier this year seekingÂ coins from Jordan in a huge way for her 16-year-old son. Smith withdrew her paternityÂ petition from the court, though, but was later ordered by the judge to pay Jordan $9,704.13 for her false paternity claim. Now Theus has stepped up to the plate. According to TMZ, Jordan has reportedly filed legal documents stating that TheusÂ knows who her baby daddy is â and it is certainly not him! The plot thickens!

And yet in the same breath, 2015 was a year of Black joy during whichÂ our culture dominated not only in our lives, but in the mainstream consciousness.

 Although the term âbaby mamaâ may be more commonly used in ANY neighborhood today than ever before, would you watch a TV show showcasing an African American man with 10 âbaby mamasâ and 11 children?Â  Well, if you havenât heard, and you probably have (more than once), âAll My Babiesâ Mamasâ is not a joke.Â  Itâs scheduled to appear on your TV from another cable network this spring. As an African American woman who makes her living writing about relationships, I HAD to give my DARLING NIKKI TWO CENTS while trying to control my SIDE EYE.Â  Iâm sorry people but FOR REAL?Â  My gal pal said it best when she said âeven though this MAY be common in your âhoodâ that doesnât make it right.âÂ  LOL!Â  According to the âAll My Babiesâ Mamasâ trailer, 36 year old rapper Shawty Lo (Carlos Walker) may be known as a rapper but in Atlanta he is known as the man with 10 âbaby mamas and 11 children.âÂ  I must have missed the memo but when did THAT become a badge of honor in the era of HIV and AIDS? With the state of reality TV these days, I guess I shouldnât be surprised at all and should be numb at the idea of yet another television show making US look crazy but watching that trailer hit me like a bullet!?!! How many folks are going to see THAT and think this is the norm in the Black community or think their big pay day is to get knocked up by a rapper?Â  #DARLING_NIKKI_REALTALK For me, the 13 minute âsuper teaseâ or trailer was more like a commercial for BIRTH CONTROL for both MEN and WOMEN then actual entertainment. Iâm not sure who would sign up to have a baby with a man the same time as another woman or maybe even two or three other woman (There are multiple children the same age.Â  You do the math!).Â  I also donât know what man would want the headache of putting up with all those women AT THE SAME TIME for the rest of his life.Â  Why not just protect yourself from the nonsense?Â  Well, Shawty Lo had an answer for that too. âThey [the women] was in love and I probably was too.Â  Hell, it just happened,â said Shawty Lo in the âAll My Babiesâ Mamasâ trailer. Iâm not sure who Iâm rolling my eyeballs at the hardest, Shawty Lo or the women who all have been nicknamed for the show?!? From the âFirst Ladyâ (once engaged to Shawty Lo) to âThe Fighter Baby Mama,â âWanna Be-Bougie Baby Mama,â âNo Drama Baby Mama,â âThe Shady Baby Mama,âÂ  "The Jealous Baby Mama" and âThe Baby Mama From Hell,â which name would you want to be known as?Â  For me, NONE OF THE ABOVE. Well, at least one âbaby mamaâ had her head screwed on straightâ¦sorta.Â  She stated for the cameras thatâ¦âWhen I found out he had so many kids, the first thing I wanted to do was get myself checked and make sure I didnât have any diseases from him.Â  Thank God I didnât.â
â Amanda âThe Jealous Baby Mamaâ Shawty Loâs current 19-year-old girlfriend is the same age as not one, not two but three of his daughters and she is proud of her love for the ATL rapper.Â  âWhen I first figured out Carlos had 10 baby mothers and 11 kids, I didnât care cause I was already crazy about him,â she said. For everybody that says this is âcoolâ because he can afford it I have to ask â can he?Â  Why is he opening up his home, heart and children for the cameras?Â  He is not doing this for FREE!!!! Or perhaps his pockets donât need the extra ching Â but the itch to become the next big reality TV star is just too tempting.Â  Â For me, itâs not about the money or the fame itâs about spreading your seed and not really caring about the consequences PERIOD.Â  While we are teaching our young daughters and sons to be âresponsibleâ Â we are also rewarding a man and all his affairs with a TV show?Â  For those that say that everybody appears to be âhappyâ and he is taking care of his, my response is, thatâs the LEAST he should be doing but does the world need to see it?Â  And although the woman may seem âhappyâ nowâ¦ I bet you that wasnât the case when many of them were pregnant at the same time and or finding out about other women.Â  Thatâs the side of the story that sometimes never gets fixed no matter how big the paycheck or ratings. One man and all his âbaby mamasâ plus his 19 year old girlfriend (the same age as three of his children) equals Â a train wreck on roller skates.Â  Sorry, I said it but it is what it is!Â  Iâm sure the show will do blockbuster numbers if its not cancelled first but like my gal pal said, âthat donât make it right.â

News Dan Marino and 7 More NFL Stars with Baby Mama Drama Related posts from this category Related posts from this category Get The Top 5 News Stories Each Day in Your InBox  Leave a Reply Cancel reply We will never share your email address.  With the world all atwitter about Dan Marinoâs apparent extra-marital affair and subsequent secret child, itâs a nice time to reflect on other football players and the freaky litters theyâre leaving left and right.  So donât judge Dan too harshly, these cats are lapping him. Travis Henry
 Travis Henry was a successful running back in the league for six seasons, bouncing around from Buffalo to Tennessee to Denver and then eventually getting a three-year deal at a federal prison for cocaine trafficking.  Along the way he fathered at least nine children with nine different women, although reports on the number seem to fluctuate all the way up to 11 kids.  On a positive note, he has been reinstated and is eligible to play in NFL again if a team decides to take a chance on the 33-year-old running back.  Apparently the child support is a real killer. Antonio Cromartie  Cromartie and his wife are expecting twins, which will bring their grand total to four little ones.  Seems like a nice family heâs got brewing there. The only problem is the man has fathered a total of 10 other kids with eight different women in six different states.  So numbers 11 and 12 might lose a bit of their luster at this point.  Iâd make a joke about how heâs struggled in certain coverage schemes or whatever, but being on the Jets right now is
punishment enough. Janoris Jenkins
Itâs a boyâ¦.again! Itâs a boyâ¦.again! Meet the new kid on the block, at least in terms of contributing the most to the world overpopulation epidemic.  Jenkins fathered four kids with three different women, and now a fourth mama is claiming heâs the father.  It should also be noted that three of these babies were born in the same year.  So â¦ yeah, he has unprotected sex at the same rate most people change the oil in their car.  Also, heâs only 24 years old, so thereâs a chance he could rise to greatness.  He should probably get some financial advice though. Ray Lewis
 By far the most polarizing figure in the sport, Lewis has had his share of ups and downs in his career.  That of course includes being accused of a double murder, and pleading guilty to obstruction of justice.  These days the linebacker is prepping for the Super Bowl and being accused of huffing deer antler velvet (you canât make this sh*t up) before riding into the sunset to spend more time with his family.  That family includes six children with four different women, mind you.  Now, in case you havenât noticed, Lewis is quite vocal about his faith these days. Iâm guessing forgiveness is a big theme here. Charles Rogers
 Besides being one of the biggest busts in NFL history, Rogers got two separate women pregnant before graduating high school.  He finished up with five illegitimate children total, and played in only 14 games professionally.  If that wasnât enough, the guy really hit bottom when he assaulted the mother of one of his kids and entered rehab for substance abuse.  This guy was supposed to be the next Randy Moss by the way. Marshall Faulk
 Marshall pulled off six kids with three different women while helping Kurt Warner run the greatest show on turf.  His 12,000 yards got him into Canton in 2011, but those six mouths to feed have kept him on the air as an analyst.  Also, heâs still pissed about that whole Spygate thing. Derrick Thomas
 Pass-rushing guru and Hall of Famer Thomas was a monster on Kansas Cityâs defensive line throughout the â90s.  When he wasnât getting seven sacks in a game, he was producing seven children with five different women.  At age 33 he was tragically killed from injuries suffered in a car crash, leaving both his large family and the Chiefs faithful devastated.

     American Graduate Short Films: Baby Mama High Craig Phillips ABOUT THE AUTHOR TAGS  Itâs a startling statistic: 52% of American Latina girls get pregnant in their teens; more than half of those in high school never graduate. Heather Rossâs short documentary Baby Mama HighÂ looks at this issue from the perspective of an Escondido, CA, teenager.Â Itâs the last few weeks of high school for Yessenia, a soft-spoken senior with two small daughters and a boyfriend whoâd rather she stay at home than go to school. Yessenia is forced to choose: stand up for herself and her daughters, or give in to expectation. Yesseniaâs story in Baby Mama High sheds light on the culture of early motherhood in the Latino community, as well as universal themes of struggling to break free of the expectations of a partner, family, and community.  Baby Mama High is one ofÂ five short filmsÂ that are part of the American Graduate public media initiative supported byÂ Corporation for Public Broadcasting to help local communities across America find solutions to address the dropout crisis. These films (which includeÂ Canât Hold Me Back, I Really Want to Make It, Immigrant High, and Skipping Up) collectively showcase a diverse array of determined Latino adolescents, from Oakland to Detroit, New York to San Antonio, who have all struggled to overcome challenges â gang violence, drugs, poverty, young motherhood, and language barriers â as they keep their eyes on the prize: a high school diploma.  The American Graduate films are each available to watch for free online. We recommend each as appetizers before the two-part filmÂ The Graduates, which premieres on Independent LensÂ Monday, Oct 28, but they stand pretty well on their own, too. Weâll be promoting a separate short daily over the course of five days, so check back for the next installment.

Stay in the loop we will never send you anything boring ... promise! Read this to move forward from baby mama drama It's a tough road to travel. You've met a wonderful man who
loves you, who is secure and supportive of your dreams. You're smitten and you
can't believe how fortunate you are. There's just one hurdle you have to climb, but it seems more like a mountain. He has children from a previous relationship, and the woman he was with is a true-life horror story. Your love triangle
includes a Baby Mama, and it's not pretty. What is a Baby Mama? Well, Baby Mama is simply another term
for a woman who shares a child with a man whom she is no longer in a
relationship with. She is the mother of their child and, whether you like it or
not, she will never disappear. RELATED: How Much Input Can a Stepmom Have? Not every Baby Mama is spiteful, hateful or ridiculous, but
those who are can be a force to be reckoned with. But why does she behave in
such an irrational manner? Why the late night calls that erupt into arguments?
Why the contemptuous stare downs at family functions? Why does every decision
have to become a war? The first reason you may come up with is she's bitter and she
wants to reconcile her relationship with her ex. You believe this because it makes you feel
like the victor, as though you won a prize that she so desperately wants. If it
makes you feel good about yourself, go right ahead and continue believing that lie.
The truth is no one wants him but you. The real reason may be more complex
than you can imagine. It can be any one of these reasons: 1. The love of your life is still sleeping with his
Baby Mama. He's complaining about you to her, and she can't respect you because
she knows your secrets and fears. 2. You've shown her she can get under your skin. A
Baby Mama who knows how to push your buttons will do it for entertainment
purposes. When she knows that all she has to do is send a text or say a word and
you will react with venom, it gives her satisfaction to know that she can
control you. 3. They have always communicated in an unhealthy manner. What explanation did he give for their breakup? Did he explain that she was crazy? Did you ask how he reacted to her craziness? Why would you expect civil and rational behavior from a woman who is used to being disrespected by her ex? If your loving partner is being unloving to the mother of his child, she will react in the same way because that is the nature of their relationship. 4. She's finally asserting herself. After years of
being in a relationship that has been abusive or diminishing to her spirit, the
Baby Mama may finally realize that she has some power in her life and is overindulging in her right to say no or set guidelines. 5. The drama is a cover-up for how she really
feels. She may still have feelings for him; in fact, she probably does. The
love that exists between two parents cannot be completely broken, not even by
anger or disappointment. Instead of accepting the fact that love still exists
in her heart, she may not be mature enough to accept it for what it is and move
on. She may not realize that the love she feels doesn't have to expressed
romantically. Or she doesn't want him to believe she still loves him so she acts
out in ways that supposedly express hatred or disdain when, really, it's all a
cover-up. 6. The rest of her life is out of her control. When
a Baby Mama faces experiences like the loss of a loved one, being stagnant in
her career or caring for someone who is dealing with a prolonged illness, she
experiences the stress of not being able to control her life. This causes her
to hold the reins even more tightly with situations she CAN controlâlike
her children, your mood and her household. RELATED: How I Became Friends With My Stepkid's Mom 7. She's angry because he grew up. Relationships
that form during the early years of our lives are difficult to maintain because
the two parties grow up and grow apart. It could be that during their time
together, the Baby Mama wanted a certain treatment from the love of your life
but she never received it because he was too immature to understand the
importance of what she asked for. Now that he has grown up, she is seeing a
different side of him, and it angers her that he could not offer her the kind of
love and respect that he is now offering you. Do you have Baby Mama Drama? Share This on Facebook?

The couple got engaged but separated in 2010, Morales claims, and soon after she found out Odom was set to wed the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star in an over-the-top televised ceremony.

A few hours later, the Eagles running back took town his Twitter page entirely. 
 LeSean "Shady" McCoy lived up to his nickname Saturday night when he embarked on a Twitter battle with his baby mama, calling her names and insisting his followers also harass her on the social media site.     A few hours later, the Eagles running back took town his Twitter page entirely.  First he laughably posted he was "hacked."     The baby mama drama all began when McCoy innocently tweeted that he was in Puerto Rico on vacation. This led to a number of replies from @Angelface0330, whose account is still active, about the fact that McCoy is not enough involved with their sonÂ  who was born in April, according to the woman named Steph's Twitter profile.     With varying levels of profanity, Steph said McCoy has herpes, mocked his penis size, said his good friend had sex with his current girlfriend and also suggested that McCoy had recently performed oral sex on her in efforts to avoid child support payments.     McCoy replied that Steph was a "Broke bum" and a "nobody" who was trying to make her name off their son and told his followers to "Tell @Angelface0330 to get a job n stop begging for child support money she a BUM needs me to LIVE sad!!!"   He also said "I hit u n a week without knowing ya name .. My son the only reason u have a life u broke stop frontn on IG ...U BUM." If we may translate: McCoy says he had sex with this woman less than a week after they met and he didn't know her name. He suggests she's casting aspersions and inaccuracies on the social media site Instagram. CrossingBroad.com archived and posted dozens of tweets from the couple back and forth and once McCoy started retweeting messages from his fans, harrassing the mother of his child.  While obviously neither party needed to publicly attack the other and drag a baby into the fray, we sincerely doubt that McCoy was forced into having unprotected sex with this woman.  Perhaps it's time the Eagles, and all major sports teams finally add Condom Instructor or even a Pulling-Out Coordinator to their coaching rosters. Reps for McCoy were not immediately available for comment Sunday. Steph, who continues to tweet about the matter, also did not return our inquiry.

I canât believe it either that Pauly D is a dad. But he is, and now that the news broke (the same day as Snooki & Jwoww season 3 premiered on MTVâ¦go figure), more and more details have surfaced about this mystery woman (and baby!). Hereâs what we know so far. OK! News: Pauly D Confirms That He Has a Daughter The baby mamaâs name is Amanda Markert. Sheâs a former Hooters waitress who was working as a hostess at the time she got knocked up in Vegas by Pauly. Both parties were intoxicated when it happened, FYI. Instagram Amanda is only 25 but she already has another kid from a previous relationship. Her son Mikey is a super cute five-year-old boy. OK! Exclusive: Pauly D Hangs Out With The Backstreet Boys The new babyâs name is Amabella, and sheâs really, really cute. Amanda has an entire Instagram page essentially devoted to her kids which you can check out @A_Markert. Instagram Amabella is 5 months old, which means that Pauly and Amanda slept together circa August 2012. They met at Harrahâs Resort & Casino in Vegas where Amanda was hosting and Pauly was DJing at the time. Amanda still lives there with her kids but Pauly now lives back on the East Coast. Photos: 13 Celebs Who Went Wedding Dress Shopping on TV Pauly has allegedly not yet met his daughter, but he and Amanda are now in a bitter legal battle over custody of the little girl.

 Jermichael Finley had a rough Saturday night/Sunday morning, and Iâm not even sure where to begin or how to try and explain this, so Iâll let his Baby Mamaâs tweets tell the story. Backstory: Chelsie Bellisle, the woman whose tweets youâre about to read, had a baby with Finley. Here are the paternity court documents. Finley is a tight end on the Green Bay Packers and in February 2012, signed a 2-year, $14 million contract. Heâs married to the very cute Courtney Finley. The action begins sometime after midnight early Sunday morning, with Finleyâs baby mama tweeting at Finleyâs wife.

  Chief Keefâs Middle School-Aged Baby Mama Says Heâs A Deadbeat Dad Leave a Comment #DontShoot Report Bangin Candy Despite rolling around with plenty of cash at all times, Â Chief Keef has trouble paying his bills. The Chicago rapper is allegedly behind on the $3K a month child support paymentsÂ he was orderedÂ to one of his baby mamas, which could lead to another arrest.Â  TMZÂ reports: 17-year-old Rapper Chief Keef has been stiffing his middle school-aged baby mama on child support â¦ or so she claims, which is crazy ironic considering the guy rolls around with STACKS of cash in his pocket. As we reported, Keef allegedly fathered the child when he was just 15 and the mother was still in middle school â¦ and he was subsequently ordered to pay $2,600 per month in child support (plus $500 for daycare) based on his income of $13,000 per month. But the mother has now filed legal docs, claiming Keef hasnât been paying his child support bills. The girl says Keef was supposed to start paying up in May, but so far heâs only paid $1,900 â¦ meaning heâs already way behind â¦ which is mindblowing if itâs true because Keef regularly carries THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN CASH. Like that time he was arrested with $8,000 in his pocket, or that time he left LAX with stacks of stacks. The girl claims she canât afford to support herself without Keefâs money and he needs to pay up stat. A judge has since ordered the rapper to appear in court in September to explain why he hasnât paid. If he doesnât show up, an arrest warrant could be issued. Calls to Keefâs camp werenât returned. Keef does seem to dote Kayden, his daughter with another girl/woman, since she is a fixture on his Instagram. But we doubt the judge will go for any âWell, I take care of one of my childrenâ arguments. Considering Sosa is getting hit up by baby mamas for cash, his superfluous spending habits and a debut album that fell below expectations, weâd be willing to bet the âDonât Likeâ rapper will be crying broke in less than two years. Thus, the girl may want to reconsider her career trajectory if âChief Keefâs baby mommaâ is how she plans to make a living. â Photo: Instagram  Bode Millerâs baby mama Sara McKenna claims: âHe never offered to use a condomâ âYou have to agree to have four of my babies,â Miller reportedly texted Sara McKenna â adding a pair of smiley faces â during a conversation last year. Olympic Gold medalist Miller married pro volleyballer Morgan Beck â while McKenna was pregnant.   Ex-Marine Sara McKenna and her son with Bode Miller, Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna,  in Sheridan Square Park in the West Village â her move to New York while pregnant, set off a custody fight. Sara McKenna says of Miller, ââHe assumed I was ready to get pregnant.â Sara McKenna leaves family court Thursday in Manhattan after an appearance there in her child-custody battle with Olympic skier Bode Miller. Bode Miller has a child with Sara McKenna and married his wife when she was pregnant. Bode Miller wanted to have lots of kids, says his baby-moma Sara McKenna. Most Popular Entertainment Video 
	The mother of Olympic gold medalist Bode Millerâs infant son says the earlier death of a newborn daughter steeled her to safeguard her second childâs life. 
	Sara McKenna â who claims the Olympic bad boy wanted her to have an abortion â said the memory of her first childâs premature birth and demise motivated her to stay strong. 
	âThatâs why I fought so hard to keep this one,â Sara McKenna told the Daily News on Friday. âThat made me more careful this time. I wasnât going to go through that again.â 
	The 27-year-old ex Marine said she almost suffered a miscarriage from stress when she was five months pregnant after learning that Millerâs new wife, volleyball player Morgan Beck, was telling friends she planned to raise McKennaâs baby. 
	She claimed she was later bombarded with messages from Beck, who wanted to know where McKenna lived â ostensibly so Miller could send child support papers for little Samuel Bode Miller McKenna. Actually, McKenna said, Miller wanted to serve her with more legal papers in New York. 
	Two days after the Feb. 23 birth, McKenna said she visited the 6th Precinct stationhouse seeking an order of protection against Beck. 
	McKenna was pregnant when she moved to New York to enroll in Columbia University under the GI Bill. That complicated a custody fight for the child that Miller started in California, before the baby was born. A Manhattan Family Court referee ruled Thursday that the case belongs back in California. 
	An attorney for the acclaimed skier, who earned five Winter Games medals, declined comment on the increasingly harsh legal fight. 
	McKenna said she first became pregnant by a longtime boyfriend in 2009 â but he, like Miller, wasnât interested in marriage. 
	The little girl was born two weeks prematurely and died two days later due to problems with her lungs, McKenna said. 
	McKenna told The News that she and Miller, 35, met through a high-end Internet dating service last year and shared a sexual encounter in California. 
	The two went their separate ways, but McKenna said they resumed contact a couple weeks later and agreed to meet in Florida in May 2012, where McKenna became pregnant.

												 Not only has Michael Jacksonâs baby mama Debbie Rowe reunited with daughter Paris â but sheâs also ready to take custody of the troubled teen once Paris is sprung from the hospital after a suicide bid, sources said yesterday. âDebbieâs door has always been open to Paris, and she will do whatever it takes to help her daughter,â a source close to the pair told The Post. âShe will take custody if Paris wants to come and live with her.â Rowe â the biological mother of Paris, 15, and older brother, Prince, 16 â is calling the shots on Parisâ welfare in the wake of the teenâs suicide bid this week.  âKatherine [Jackson] has asked Debbie for help,â the source said, referring to Parisâ 83-year-old grandmother and Jackson family matriarch, who has co-guardianship of the teens and their younger brother, Blanket, 11.  âThe rest of the family is looking to Debbie to take the lead; she has extensive experience in psychology,â said the source.  Rowe, who got at least $15 million in alimony from Jackson, would also take custody of Prince, but he has wanted nothing to do with his birth mom, several sources said.  With a car and a driversâ license, Prince has also been spending less time at home with Katherine.   âAs soon as heâs 18, he is outta there,â said a source close to the Jacksons. The custody issue came up after The Post reported yesterday that T.J. Jackson, a cousin who has co-guardianship of the siblings with Katherine, has not been living full time in the kidsâ Calabasas, Calif., home. He has his own home two hours away.  Paris had already been staying at Roweâs ranch outside LA on weekends before she downed a fistful of Motrin and cut her wrists this week.  The teen had planned to spend the summer with her mom, with whom she recently reconnected. Meanwhile, in the wake of media reports about the teenagerâs precarious health, the Los Angeles judge overseeing Michael Jacksonâs estate and his childrenâs guardianship yesterday ordered an investigation into Parisâ situation.  A probate investigator âshall prepare a written report and include therein any recommendations related to the minor childâs health, education and welfare,â LA Superior Court judge Mitchell Beckloff wrote.  He warned that the report âshall be provided only to the court,â with no copies disseminated to any other parties.  Katherine and the Jackson clan are âbracing for a custody battle,â a source close to the family said â even though Roweâs camp insists she will not go to war with them. âItâs their own paranoia,â the source said of the Jacksons. âThey are afraid the kids will be taken away from them.â LA County Child and Family Services agents want to âinterview each of the kids at length in the next few days,â said the source. Also yesterday, another source said Paris will not return to her posh private school, and may opt to be home-schooled.

Anne Hathaway Nails Maternity Style In A Dotted Mini Dress Alongside Her Husband As They Red Carpet Debut Her Baby Bump  This is a terrible way to get things done, but it seems like he's left her no choice! Pauly D has been reportedly trying to see his love child Amabella, but maybe heâs not THAT eager! The Jersey Shore alum has apparently tried to contact his baby mama Amanda Markert to see his little girl, but hasnât gotten an answer. Well, the mom took to Twitter again on Wednesday to explain her situation: âThis is getting out of hand, you've had my number since day 1. Come bond with her any day, any time you and your family want. @DJPaulyDâ âIt could all be so simpleâ¦.
Call nowâ¦
@DJPaulyDâ âSince we last spoke I don't have any way to get in touch with you directly and I think we can solve this by talking ASAP.
@DJPaulyDâ So, it sounds like Amanda actually did want to contact him, but couldnât. You know how celebrities can be! Amanda also went on another rant previously, stating that Pauly D knew about the baby all along and even paid some of the expenses! She said: "Looks like any chances of utilizing my degree towards a positive career and future for my kids is now ruined bc of the mediaâ¦" âI kept this a secret from everyone BUT him for a reason, the best interests of my children. It's not my fault he told.â âAnd the 'texts' were NEVER brought up by me. He told media that too.â âAnd who gets hurt out of all the negative he has put out there? The baby girl.â âAnd when she reads about her father wanting her aborted, it's going to damage her little heart.â âStop putting negative out there! For the sake of the little girl.â âThe interview I did only, to defend myself, was not compensated!â âThe pictures of my children out there were stolen from my social media sites, which I keep in touch with friends and family.â âI can't even walk my son to the bus stop now because people are out there taking pictures.â âWorst week of my life. God give me strength.â âI saw the ultrasound. I heard the heartbeat. I couldn't go through with itâ¦â âSo yes it paid for ONE ultrasound, Blood work, and proof of pregnancy. I paid for 9 months of doctors appointments followingâ¦.â âI have been financially supporting Amabella MYSELF for the past 5 months.â âApparently he wrote a check and sent it a few days ago just to show the media the copy of itâ¦publicity stunt.â âI love my children more than ANYTHING in this world. The chaos he has created is a shame.â âHe has NEVER contacted me to see this child and I have never denied him his rights as a father.â âNor did I hide the pregnancy from him. He knew all along and he never once denied it was his.â âCalling her a 'love child' in the media. Does he not realize she will read all of this later on?! And how damaging it will be!?!â âI have studied about child psychology and child growth and development within my years of schoolingâ¦â ââ¦And I know the importance of having both parents involved. I hope he ends this war and starts making the right choices.â âThis is REALITY not a REALITY sitcom! Leave your publicity mask at home. I'm sick of this!â Wow!!! Can someone get this girl another interview? She has A LOT to say!!! No one really knows whatâs going on with this situation except Pauly D and Amanda, but we truly hope that the DJ gets to see his baby sooner than later! [Image via Instagram.]
 Tags: amabella, amanda markert, baby blabber, baby momma drama, legal matters, pauly d, twitter, visitation I love how these girls get all high on morals after they've had unprotected sex with a "celebrity" stranger.  I feel for her daughterâ¦not her or Pauly!!!
 It's not appropriate that the first time meeting his five month old daughter would be taking her for two weeks. What does he really expect? Did he really think she would be ok with that?
 This woman clearly has a brain in her head and loves her children. I just heard of all this now, but I really hope that her message gets out loud and clear.. she is not looking for B.S.. and people who talk about her sleeping with a celebrity unprotected,â¦. seriously probably most women who are in the spur of the moment and star struck would do the same. She is human and not once sought attention like most women who sleep with celebs. I loved all the quotes she wrote because it shows her priorities in life and shows that she can see right through the B.S produced by the sperm donor. Love it! You go girl.
  
We're so thrilled to see Kate Middleton taking on such an important cause! On Wednesday, Kate expressed her views on children's mental health in a blog post through the Huffington Post's "Young Minds Matter" series. The piece was as well written as it was informative. Related: Kate Will Soon Give Her First On-Camera Interview! In the message, Middleton expresses her belief that addiction and adulthood problems are often caused by "unresolved childhood challenges". The momma warned that if precautionary measures aren't taken to address the needs of "taboo" issues children too often face, this will lead to major issues down the road. K.M. elaborated on her position: "...time and time again, the issues that led people to addiction and destructive decision making seemed to almost always stem from unresolved childhood challenges. It became clear to me that many children â even those younger than five â have to deal with complex problems without the emotional resilience, language or confidence to ask for help. And it was also clear that with mental health problems still being such a taboo, many adults are often too afraid to ask for help for the children in their care." While this is such a sensitive issue, it's nice to see the Duchess of Cambridge working with mental health charities like the Anna Freud Centre to bring change. Not only did the beauty incorporate her own work anecdotes to express her opinion, but she also included tidbits about children Prince George and Princess Charlotte to drive the PSA home. The brunette explained: "Like most parents today, William and I would not hesitate to seek help for our children if they needed it. We hope to encourage George and Charlotte to speak about their feelings, and to give them the tools and sensitivity to be supportive peers to their friends as they get older. We know there is no shame in a young child struggling with their emotions or suffering from a mental illness." Aw! Georgie and Char are SO lucky to have such well-informed and doting parents!

With so many different birth control options available in 2013, itâs amazing that rappers continue to roll the dice with psychotic groupies and money-thirsty jump-offs who only want the fame, fortune and nothing else. Here are eight rappers caught up (or recovering) from baby mama drama. Take a look.  50 Cent  First, the messy Rap diva was accused of assaulting his secret baby mama (Daphne Joy) that no one knew existed then lashed out at his own son with baby mama #1 (Shaniqua Tompkins) via text.  Beef with both baby mamas at the same damn time? Only 50, who once dissed the entire industry and was nearly assassinated.  Future  The golden-voiced rapper/croonerâs trio of thirsty baby mamas (yes, THREE) love interrupting his body parties with Ciara to demand more cash based on his stardom. STRESSFUL.  Nas  Carmen Bryan is Hip-Hop baby mama royalty who refuses to let the legendary father of their daughter live without publicly spewing venom.  Forever scorned? Hell yea.  Rick Ross  The sloppy Rap walrusâ scorned baby mama Tia joined forces with arch nemesis 50 to end his career by spilling unsweetened tea in a raggedy tell-all book and failed, miserably.   Flo-Rida  He may be filthy rich off 12-year-old white girl money, but cheap when it comes to paying child support for his alleged 2-year-old that he denied was his. According to legal docs (acquired by TMZ), he is NOT the father despite Gloriaâs claims but hasnât been officially cleared by the Florida court.   Akon  The fertile father of a village worth of kids is always embroiled in baby mama warfare over cash. In fact, he was JUST sued for more child support in May.  Scrappy  Thereâs nothing healthy about your linebacker-built mother and her wet & wavy wig-helmet trying to fade your baby mama on national TV, but it happened (in slow motion), and ruined his already stressful relationship with baby mama Erica.  Layzie Bone  The âother light-skinned one not named Bizzyâ from iconic Hip-Hop group Bone Thugs-N-Harmony knocked up a woman while married and ignored her until she fought for child support and involved the courts. If anything, HE created his own baby mama drama. Reblogged this on City Press.  Evelyn Lozada Already Knows About Carl Crawfordâs Other Baby Mama, Amy Freeman Rihanna Had a Huge Meltdown Before the Grammys, and Thatâs Why She Canceled Her Performance? Watch âThe People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Storyâ Episode 3 Minnie From âLittle Women Atlantaâ Pregnant With Pastor Troyâs Baby Taylor Swift Responded to Kanye West in the Best Way Possible at the Grammys Watch Justin Bieberâs 2016 Grammys Performance (ft. Skrillex & Diplo): âLove Yourselfâ and âWhere Are Ã Nowâ MORE POP CULTURE LIKE US ON FACEBOOK Evelyn Lozada shocked us all when she announced that she was having a baby, and when folks found out who the father was â MLB player Carl Crawford â they immediately got to digging, and discovered that Evâs new baby daddy isnât exactly âNEWâ to this whole fatherhood thing. Not only does Carl have a 10-year-old son from another relationship, but he also just had ANOTHER baby over the summer by a woman named Amy FreemanÂ â the mother of his first child (see below).  Evelyn is about six months pregnant, so if Carl just had a baby about six months ago, that would mean that Ev got pregnant either right before or soon after the birth of Carlâs new baby. But what about those âsourcesâ who told TMZ that she and Carl had been seeing each other for âalmost a yearâ and their relationship had gotten âserious?â A relationship canât be that âseriousâ if a guy has a baby with one woman around the same time he impregnates another. Hold up, wait a minute. Let me put some pimpinâ in it â¦ before you start getting messy with that information and have Evelyn looking at Carl like this:  Bossip did their homework and confirmed that while Crawford did have a baby recently, he isnât a cheater and Evelyn isnât a home-wrecker. According to our source Carl was single when Amy, who is mother to his 10-year-old son, became pregnant with their newest baby. The two were not dating and according to our source, Crawford believed Amy was on the pill â because thatâs what she told him! Carl and Amy have not dated or lived together in over seven years, and this latest child was the result of an offhand, one-time incident where the pair were just being consenting adults having sex. Evelyn didnât even come into the picture until much later. I see â¦ said the blind man who never saw. The good news is that Evelyn Lozada is his new baby mama. The bad news? Well, there is none!Â There are a lot of guys out there â including this guy! **points at self** â who would love to have babies with a woman like Evelyn Lozada. Just ask Chad Ochocinco. He tried, but failed, miserably. Just donât make the same mistakes, playa! Check out Locked Up: Celebs Who Have Done Hard Time  by Gossip On This at Mode Carl Crawford is the dumbest man that has ever lived. Didnât      learn when she stole Antoineâs money or when she used 85. WHAT AN IDIOT Youâre so right  And whoever wrote this article is not too bright as well.  Because theyâre saying, âAny man is lucky to have a baby with Evelyn.â  WOW!  What morals!!! Whatever happened to getting married and having kids with one person? Between them they got 2 women 2 men and four kids with broken families. The devil is busy, God has got to be tired of manâs charade. Read the book of Revelations in the Bible mans time is running short. Whoever wrote this article is a real fool. A baby with a psychotic, violent, supergroupie? Really ? Those are your ambitions? She bankrupts Walker then dumps him, destroys Ochos career and spends an entire season catawailing on TV about him, in the meantime she was porking Carl Crawford and probably everything else she could find with a contract. Waitâ¦. Did Eve or her cronies write his article?. What? This woman has her own money!! Sheâs got a book. Sheâs on TV. She has a store. âDestroy Ochoâs career?â How? He did that all by himself; starting with that stupid name! These athletes donât get to play house; and then embarrass womenâ¦ for free~ like a broke man can. MâKay??? Evelyn can âpokeâ whoever she wants. Is she to be vilified just because sheâs pretty? What? Pretty women with real hair arenât supposed to have sex drives?? And if they can bag a hard body with moneyâ¦. they shouldnât because??? Yes, she has violent streak. Sheâs working on itâ¦ nobodyâs perfect. Whatâs really your problem??? Are you not pretty?? You canât poke who you want? I donât get it! Great response Evelyn (CommonSense)! You are so creative. Get a real life you super groupie. Normally, I wouldnât give you a responseâ¦but damn! Howâs a person responding to an article from 2013 telling anybody else to âget a real lifeâ?? Try to keep up, okay? Evelyn I wrote it because I knew YOU WOULD respond. You ainât foolin nobody. You can try to change your image but your reputation will always remain the same. LOL!!! Hilarious love me, because Iâve fooled you. I wouldnât mind being Evelyn, for the money and access to great parties. But my own life is got me so amazed. Canât wait to see what Iâm up to nextâ¦ Anyway, you take good care! Youâre pretty funnyâ¦of course you wouldnât mind being who you are Ev. Thatâs all you talk about when you defend yourself on social media. âOh the money money money and all the women who would love to be in your shoes because you f&%$ athletesâ. You might want to change that up. Itâs getting old like you. Canât wait to see how your life turns out. Anyway, you take good care too! She was busy abusing women her whole career, Ocho was stupid to get nvolved with her, because she is a groupie looking for a rich athlete. She has trapped Crawford now, what an idiot. Why anyone would want a part of that gene pool is a mystery, letâs hope Crawford takes an active part in raising this child. .. If it inherits her morals it would be so sadâ¦. Evelyn is pure scum. âThe bad news? Well, there is none!â? Really, what about when you just said, âthis latest child was the result of an offhand, one-time incident where the pair were just being consenting adults having sex.â? Iâm sure that child will feel fantastic that you called him thatâ¦ Read more: Evelyn Lozada Already Knows About Carl Crawfordâs Other Baby Mama, Amy Freeman Dear Carl, Please do not let the checks be late. love, Evelyn This article is played!

Iâm in Johannesburg, talking about relationships with a guy, a friend of a friend, I met earlier in the night. As in the United States, itâs impossible for a mixed group to get together and the conversation not turn that way. This guy is talking about how his fatherâs two divorces have affected his outlook on dating. Heâs getting pretty deep in his feelings, which doesnât surprise me given the amount of liquor consumed in our revelry. Iâm listening with undivided interest until he calls his own mother and his stepmother âbaby mamas.â âEx-wives, you mean?â I say it the same way you would correcting a kid who has used improper grammar. Â He looks at me funny because he doesnât get it. âSame thing, no?âNo. Itâs not the same thing. A wife is a married woman. An ex-wife is a formerly married woman. And âbaby mamaâ? It started out being a demeaning term for a woman who has a child by a man she was not married to and where the ârelationshipâ between the pair was just sex. It quickly evolved to a description of any unmarried woman who had a child. Iâve always hated it for erasing the idea of any commitment that may have once existed between a couple and reducing it only to functions related to the child. (For clarity, I hate âbaby daddyâ too, and for the same reason.) This hood term went mainstream circa 2008, when Universal released Baby Mama starring Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. Unfortunately, itâs become a catch-all to describe all mothers â including married moms. Take the guy above, who unironically called his own mother one. Or recall Fox News going way-out ignorant during the 2008 election and referring to then-would-be FLOTUS as âObamaâs Baby Mama.â Fox News didnât exactly apologize, but the senior vice president of programming acknowledged âa producer on the program exercised poor judgment.â You think? I thought again about how insulting the term was upon hearing the way Kanye West announced that his girlfriend, Kim Kardashian, is pregnant. On December 30, he declared to his concert audience, âMake noise for my baby mama.â I suppose âbaby mamaâ is better than âperfect bitch,â Westâs previous accolade for Kardashian, but itâs still pretty bad. Wouldnât âmy girlfriendâ have been just as accurate? No matter the current relationship status between a couple â married, divorced, committed, etc. â at some point they liked and trusted each other enough to lay down together and create a child. Women should be acknowledged with respect, if not for the former relationship, if there was one, then at least for the hard work of raising a child. Demetria L.

You'll Love   Pauly Dâs baby mama Amanda Markert has resorted to trying to get his attention via Twitter. But he wants nothing to do with her or her family who keep sending him messages to meet in-person. And itâs getting out of hand, said a source close to the DJ.  Paulyâs one-time Hooters girl baby mama recently posted her pleas publicly:    And thatâs not all. Her friends and family are getting in on the online action. âHer family keeps tweeting him to come over for Halloween or Thanksgiving so they can meet him. Itâs like a Pauly D meet-and-greet,â said the source. In one message to Pauly it reads, âHeâs invited to come trick or treat. Why is he so negative. Come see your baby,â even adding he can âhide in costume.â Another bizarre message asks him to mail a personalized cardboard cutout to 5-month-old Amabella: âAt least send a car board cut out of yourself so Amabella can get used to your face.â While another begs him to visit Amanda and her fam, âWE ARE WAITING,â it reads. And they attempt to paint his one night stand in a good light by writing sheâs âpatient and calm. Your not giving this a chance.â âWe are awesome and fun. A new kind of fun for you. You will be in love at first sight.â But Pauly is simply turning it over to his legal team. âHe wants them to stop,â said the source. âItâs embarrassing and it looks desperate. Heâs hired a lawyer and taking this seriously. This is not going to be played out in social media. âHeâs just ignoring them and is not going to answer. Heâs just letting his lawyer know whatâs going on. âHe thinks heâs now involved in this horrible family. He doesnât want to have anything to do with them, but wants to be involved in his little girlâs life.â This is actually just giving him one more reason to want to take care of baby Amabella full-time. âHeâs going after full custody because he doesnât know her,â said the source. So far heâs asked for visitation three times, which Amanda has denied. âHe does want to reach a compromise so he can meet Amabella and know her sleeping schedule and feeding schedule so he can take care of her,â said the source. âHe wants to spend time with his baby, not with her mom.â So hereâs the backstory. The two met at a daytime pool party in Las Vegas where they hooked up (and Pauly understood she was on birth control), according to our source. Two weeks later she contacted Pauly to let him know she was pregnant. âThey discussed having an abortion because he didnât even know this girl, and then she fell off the face of the earth.â According to the source, Amanda contacted him after she gave birth to their little girl andâ¦ get thisâ¦ wanted money for her silence. âShe requested money in exchange for her signing a confidentiality agreement not to say he was the father,â said the source. âBut thatâs not what Pauly wanted. He told her he didnât want to pay her off because he wants to have a relationship with his baby.â A call to Amandaâs attorney was not returned. And so the baby mama drama will most definitely continue.  Pauly D's Baby Mama -- History of Domestic Violence ... Bloodied Ex-BF in Brutal Fist Fight

The rapper initially denied her claims that he broke her nose and damaged her eye socket and now heâs denying any wrong doing, but his Marrying The Game co-star tells another story. Tiffney posted a Bible verse on Instagram along with a photo that suggests she may be afraid to tell the truth about what really went down.   âAll I needed to seeâ¦ Thank u Jesus. Thank u to my family, friends, & supporters.. Nothing more to be said or explained,â she posted. The rapper took a few subliminal shots at his woman when he posted some pics of his first babyâs mother. âBaby Mama (no drama). #EveryNiggaNeedOneOfThese,â he wrote.

  French Montana âFeeling Greatâ After Khloe Kardashian Split â Except For âBaby Mama Dramaâ Reality Gossip TV Spoilers Celeb Moms Music Red Carpet Hot Guys Khloe Kardashian Viggle Points are off at the moâ Around The Web Like or follow us to continue and get the latest updates for Wetpaint s  Itâs only been a few days since the news came out that Khloe Kardashian split with French Montana. Early reports said Khloe was the one to let him go, with French supposedly still hoping the relationship could be saved. However, if French was feeling heartsick he didnât show it Friday night at Hard Rock Hotelâs Vanity Nightclub. French talked to People while hosting a fight weekend party, and he told the magazine, "I'm feeling great. Feeling great and looking even better."  So his ego is fully intact! French had some fun weekend plans lined up with his friends, but he added to People that, in addition to working on movies and his album, he had to âdefinitely try to get rid of all these problems I got." What problems? "Baby mama drama and all kind of different [stuff]."  Do you think Khloe made that [stuff] list?  French does have a baby mama in estranged wife Deen Kharbouch, who is not a big fan of her ex. Deen told Life & Style back in April â when Khloe and French were newly dating â that as soon as French started to become successful, he "practically abandoned" his wife and son. She said, at the time, that he did pay her $7,000 a month in child support as they went through their divorce but she said "he was forced to do so" when she went to court. If French is having baby mama drama with Deen, plus work commitments, he may be too busy to try to win Khloe back â if he even really wants to. The Khloe dumped him reports could've just been spin. And some folks say their relationship was just a publicity stunt anyway. However, French may not be completely out of Khloeâs life, since he hired her mother, Kris Jenner, as his manager.

					Thanks for being patient. Sorry!   Meet Marcus Allenâs Baby Mama Lauren Hunter [PHOTOS] You Might Like Lauren Hunter Bio:  Pro Football Hall of Famer Marcus Allen was a legend during his 16-year playing career with the Raiders and Chiefs. If you believe the Nicole Brown Simpson (driftwood) stories, Allen was a legend off the field, too. Somehow during his eventful life, the now 53 year-old Allen never fathered a child â¦until eight days ago when his girlfriend Lauren Hunter, a fitness model whom he met on MySpace (!), gave birth to Drake Connor Allen. The couple welcomed their newborn son Jan. 5. Because sheâs a fitness fanatic, Hunter is already doing push-ups and eating right to get back into her sculpted pre-baby physique. It wonât take long. According to Wiki, Allen is still married to Kathryn Eickstaedt, whom he wed in O.J. Simpsonâs backyard in 1993. If thatâs true, the holidays were probably a whole lot of fun for Marcus, eh? Of course, Wiki also lists his jersey number as â33,â so who knows. Home: Los Angeles
Age: 28
Stats: 5â8â³ 123 lbs. ; 36C-26-36
Children: Three â Drake and two from a previous marriage.
Hobbies: Fitness buff. She constantly talks nutrition and working out. Not sure how Allen feels about all this? Check out this pic. Seems about right. Photos: Instagram.com/laurenashleyhunter and ModelMayhem.com [H/T: TMZ]

All Rights Reserved - iOne Women. All Rights Reserved Powered by WordPress.com VIP 2 years ago So I said I wasnât going to say anything else about the whole Dwyane Wade baby mama situation, but more details keep popping up so I figured I would update you all. Some of you might remember that Dwyane Wadeâs new fianceâ, actress Gabrielle Union, received an open letter from one of his potential jumpoffs back in February. Considering Dwyaneâs new baby was born on Nov. 10, this letter is said to be written around the time the child was conceived. Messy, messy! Take a look at the letter below (courtesy of âBlack Sports Onlineâ): So itâs only right I put Dwyane Wade on blast. First and foremost iâd like to thank ***** Wade, his cousin for booking my numerous of flights.Â  Ohh yea, hi Ms. Union. Good too see you stuck around and have a few more pieces of clothing inside of his house. The kitchen looks great by the way. I love the new counter tops. I would also like to thank Rich, the chef for his amazing breakfast. His cookies are the best.Â  And last but not least Iâd like to thank Dwayne for always making me feel comfortable on your side of the bed. Hiding pictures in your drawer. You know the night stand next to your side of the bed, the one with the two drawers. Think the picture is the one with you and Sanaa Lathan in it.Â  Also Gabrielle you are a little to old to be making Valentines day Photo albums. Leave that to the young girls your man cheats on you with. Dont believe me, I took a picture of the picture.Â  FYI your man likes fat aâs you might need to get you one. Last but not least. I will send you a picture of the bags your man left in the hotel room i fâ-d him in. lolÂ  This would sound like a regular scorned groupie if she didnât have details about their homeâ¦and if D. Wade didnât father a love child nine months later. But Gabby is never one to hold her tongue, so she took to her Twitter to respond. Twitter/Gabrielle Union/Hello Beautiful It could all be a coincidence, but there doesnât seem to be too much of those in situation.  Copyright Â© 2016 Interactive One, LLC	.

												 Reality TV became too real for Joe Piscopo when his âassistantâ â the mother of his 3 Â¹/â-year-old daughter â punched him in the face while filming ABCâs âCelebrity Wife Swap.â In an episode airing Tuesday, Joe swapped his assistant Jessica Nasoff, who has also been his on-and-off girlfriend for seven years, with the assistant of âBrady Bunchâ star Barry Williams, who lives in Branson, Mo. Piscopo, who has a morning drive-time radio show on AM 970 The Answer, âhas a propensity for bipolar women,â a friend told me. He divorced his second wife Kimberly Driscoll â an 18-year-old babysitter when he met her â a few years ago. The âWife Swapâ crew filmed Piscopoâs reunion with Jessica when she returned from Branson, but the producer wasnât satisfied. âDonât you want to get rid of the chaos in your life?â the producer prodded.  Piscopo sat back down, and said, âJess, if you had a good time in Branson, if itâs too crazy for you here, why donât you just spread your wings, and stay in Branson.â A witness said, âShe starts crying. Joe goes over to comfort her, and she cold-cocks him right in the jaw. He walked right into it.â Piscopo later told a friend, âNow Martha Stewart is looking good to me. I want an old rich broad.â

But before he got there â¦ weâre told Norma called police because she felt the custody order did not require her to turn the kid over and she needed cops to look at the document.  LAPD officers arrived and Tyrese showed up as well. Cops talked to Tyrese and left â¦ and so did Tyrese â without the kid. Law enforcement sources tell us there was no disturbance of the peace â¦ no police report was taken as far as they were concerned itâs case closed. But itâs not case closed for Tyrese. Sources connected to the actor tell TMZ â¦  heâs going to court to ask a judge to hold Norma in contempt and throw her in jail for violating the custody order. He does not believe his child was sick â¦ he thinks itâs all just revenge. Awww, poor thang, sounds like Tyrese is reading from the book of Saigon.

Featured Stories   It was one of the most talked-about moments during OutKastâs historic, star-studded homecoming shows at Atlantaâs Centennial Olympic. The three late September gigs featured a whoâs who of Southern hip-hop royalty and beyond, including members of the influential Goodie Mob; veteran Memphis rhyme duo 8ball & MJG; UGKâs respected orator Bun B; new age Mississippi spitter Big KRIT; critically acclaimed visionary Janelle Monae; Run The Jewelsâ mighty Killer Mike; ATLâs current street king Future; and left-field drifter Kid Cudi. But the sold-out crowd during the tandemâs headline-making stand was shocked to witness funk-soul priestess Erykah Badu join âKastâs AndrÃ© 3000 and partner Big Boi on the underrated Stankonia cut âHumble Mumble.â As the charismatic Badu hugged her former significant other Three Stacks she hilariously mused, âThatâs my baby daddy!â It was a clear nod to the now legendary union that produced their son Seven. But AndrÃ© tells VIBE that Baduâs jaw-dropping showing was long in the making. â[Badu] knew of the tour already,â said the celebrated MC and budding actor born AndrÃ© Benjamin, who is currently making media rounds to promote his portrayal of guitar god Jimi Hendrix in the independent film Jimi: All is by My Side. âShe was supposed to come out to Coachella but the dates did not work out. So we already know that we wanted to find the time to bring out people that we knew during the tour, and I think the Atlanta show worked out.â As for the âbaby-daddyâ talk, 3000 suggests that people are making too much of a big deal over Baduâs irreverent quip.  âWe joke a lot,â AndrÃ© says of his relationship with the unpredictable siren. âPeople just donât know our personal life. We joke like that on the phone. She calls me her baby daddy and I call her my baby mama. Itâs funny to us now because itâs such a talked-down type term. It is what it is. Itâs totally a punch line.â One person that finds the pairâs relationship off-the-wall is Seven.  âOur son is about to be 17 and he tells us, âYou guys are nuts,ââ AndrÃ© laughs. âErykah and I are cool friends, man. We talk on the phone. She even asks my advice on relationships. Sheâs like a cool sister more than anything. The first thing people would think about us is, âOh, they donât get along.â But there are always feelings when people grow apart. Itâs something you have to get through. But man, we are cool.â Stay tuned for VIBEâs full AndrÃ© 3000 Q&A. âKeith Murphy (@murphdogg29) VIBE grabbed some exclusive photos of the fellas.  Free Daily Email

Share it: 8 Responses to The Man Who Asked Me To Be His Baby-Mama. A True Story On Love, Spirit + Connection. Leave a Reply Cancel reply VOTED MOST POPULAR You have not added an image yet. Please upload and apply an image.  I want to tell you a little story. A story about a man who asked me to be his baby-mama.Â Itâs a true story. A story about love, spirit and connection. Once upon a time, in mid-March 2013, I moved to San Francisco for 3 months. A friend of mine had offered me his house in exchange for taking care of his dog while he was away on several business trips, making it a perfect opportunity to explore this beautiful city some more. Said friend has a speculative law firm; taking on high-risk, high-return cases prosecuting insurance companies, corporate organisations, and other big-world baddies, acting as prosecuting attorney for âthe little peopleâ. Women who had been sexually harassed and worse, men who had serious accidents that went uncompensated, single mothers who were illegally evicted from their rent-controlled homes and so on. This friend â letâs just call him Tom â worked very hard, and very long hours, risking his personal funds to pay for the court hearings of his low-income clients, with the hope that they would end in massive payouts. To say Tom was very stressed is certainly an understatement. His high levels of stress were palpable on every level: his body literally reeked of it; he had trouble sleeping and took sleeping pills every night to aid his rest; he suffered from various skin conditions; was balding prematurely; his friendships and relationships suffered; even his dog was nervous, on edge and frazzled. Having spent his entire life devoted to developing his vocation, here Tom was, 32 years old, with a career that was at the precipice of either taking off or burying him, and absolutely no life balance, no inner peace, no true happiness. He was miserable, and constantly consoling himself with the idea that âwhen this case succeeds / when I have this much money / when I move to this kind of amazing penthouseâ¦ Thenâ¦yes, then I will be happyâ. Tom had never spent any time developing himself either emotionally nor spiritually. Never connected with his own soul or felt what it feels like to truly live. He simply fulfilled the dysfunctional pattern of trying to create a life that appears like success in modern, capitalist America. Because that is, he thought, is what would bring him a fulfilled life. Now that you have a little bit of background, here is where things get interesting. One day Tom came home, when I was there and decided to announce he was in love with me. For me, a laughable fact, since in all his disillusioned life he had never even had a chance to get to know me. Not really. Not the way someone who loves you does. To him, all I was, was a pretty girl, a free-spirit who lived life quite differently to the way he did. And while he was certainly enamoured by my freedom, my ease, my infinite calm and joy, and my view of life, he most definitely was not in love with me. I know love. I know it well. I know what it feels and tastes like. I knew what he felt was not love. What he was perhaps in love with, was the idea of owning something in his life, which gave him an escape from the choices he had made. He saw something in me that his soul craved, that he desperately yearned for, but it was not me. While he was busy crushing his soul with endless court hearings, fighting for people and cases that made him cry, he had lost his own sensitivity, his ability to feel and connect to truth, his Spirit. And instead of seeking that connection within himself, he sought it out in others. In me. I was gentle and clear with him, that his idea of love to me is an illusion. And that perhaps he might like to look within his own soul to find what he is looking for. Because what he seeks is not in me. Tom looked at me with sad, hurt eyes. The next day he went to see his therapist. And came back with some ridiculous book about women rejecting you because they were too fucked-up to see your worth. He showed it to me and said I might like to read it. I laughed and told him to enjoy it. A week later, he confided in me his dream to have a child. He told me that he really wished to become a father, to raise a son and teach him the ways of the world. I could see that what he wished for wasnât truly a child, but to feel. To feel loved, to feel like he belonged, to feel important, to feel a sense of worth, a feeling of being needed. What he wished and craved for was a sense of connection to the powerful energy that we are all a part of, the feeling of Love the connection with soul and Spirit brings. And then things got weirdâ¦ Not long after, Tom asked me if I would help him fulfil his dream of having a child, and become his babyâs mama. He offered to support me, my life and our child; in exchange for bearing it and raising the child together as friends. No relationship. No contractual romantic commitment. Just, would I please have his baby. To this day Iâm not sure if this request was a very convoluted, complicated way to get me into bed; or to tie me to him, but as you can imagineâ¦ Thatâs just not the way I roll. I told Tom that I believe having a child comes from a union of deep, mutual love and not from a financial contract. I told him that I didnât believe that he was emotionally and mentally in a place thatâs supportive and healthy to having a family, and that perhaps this was a good opportunity to actually dig deep and delve in why he is seeking to fill this hole in his life and soul in such a way. Proclaiming love and seeking to have a child with someone who very clearly doesnât share any kind of deep feelings and emotions with you, is an act of insecurity and deep inner detachment. Tom was so disconnected from life, love and truth that he couldnât identify them. Over the next days, as he saw that my mind wouldnât change, Tom became extremely moody, dark, sharp-tongued and evasive. He wasnât comfortable with me and what I represented to him: his unwillingness to face his truth. As the air in the house that we shared, became flooded with his animosity and bitterness, I moved out, and onwards. I am forever grateful for this experience as it showed me and taught me how so many people do actually live. I needed to see and experience this, to know the contrast to my own life and choices I make. To understand why I choose the way I choose. Every experience is valuable and there is a reason why life brought the two of us together the way that it did: to learn from each other. Whenever *Tom is in my thoughts I send him love, and hope that one day he jumps into the deep abyss of his soul and finds what he seeks. His own beauty, vulnerability truth and shining light. Beautifully written, sunshine. I LOVE your perspective on life and love xx I love this! I definitely resonated when you said that he was in love with he idea of you. That your freedom and presence was appealing to him, because it was an escape from his regular life- something he is craving.  I think youâve just summed up the last lot of men in my life Thankyou Vienda!  You did it again girl ;) x Itâs so easy for all of us to project what we want or what we think we want onto others. Which is why itâs so important to remain present in every moment as to not fall into the charmed and wicked trappings of our egoic mindsâ¦ Ah, love! What a conundrum it can be! Haha! xx Iâm so very glad Iâve found your site! Love your writing style and energy. This was a beautiful story with so much to take in. Wisdom and love all over. Thank you beautiful Jade. Itâs a joy to meet you too! x Beautifully written account of love, seeking love, and a reminder that love canât be bought. Thank you! Interesting relationship and guy. I hope he has found himself and found someone to love him and support him. Iâm glad you took from this a deeper understanding of yourself. What a beautiful, bittersweet story of the human condition and yearning for one of our most basic needsâ¦all in all, we all want to be loved and want something to love. Thank you for sharing, Vienda. xx  Swizz Beatzâs Baby Mama Details Past Affair Leave a Comment #DontShoot Report Bangin Candy Jahna Sebastian, the mother of Swizz Beatzâs five-year-old daughter Nicole, has granted very few interviews regarding her past with the producer and husband of Alicia Keys. In a recent chat, the London-based singer and Russian immigrant cleared up details regarding her time with Swizz Beatz and claims she had no idea he was married during their time together. In an exclusive interview with our partners, Madame Noire, Sebastian unflinchingly answered questions regarding her past relationship with Swizz Beatz and left little doubt to the extent of their dealings then and now. More from Madame Noire: âI donât want to be associated with those women who look out for a rich man, a baller or any other successful man to help them have an easy ride in life,â the singer/songwriter told me. âThat behavior is totally the opposite of who I am and what I represent, I have always chosen to get what I want through hard work myself, even though there have always been great men around. I have always relied on myself. I work hard for my career and my child. Unlike the way it is now, the single mother explained that her former loverâs personal life was nowhere near as publicized as it now at the time of their relationship. In fact, Jahna says that his personal life was so under the radar in the UK, that she had no idea he was even married. âI was not aware of him being married at the time, I thought he was single like myself and he acted like a single man,â the âI Am Freeâ singer explained. âHe was not that well-known here anyway at that time, his private life was nowhere near as publicized in 2007 as it is now.â Sebastian says she didnât know Swizz Beatz was still married to Masonda Tifrere, the mother of their son, Kasseeem Dean Jr. She says she kept the existence of Nicole hidden as to not make matters tense for Swizz Beatz and his wife. After some time when she realized it was time to address the situation and allow Swizz Beatz ino their daughterâs life. âWe [Mashonda and I] have been in contact for a few years. She did not know that Nicole and I even existed until July 2009 when she and Swizz got the letter with the news at the same time. It was after some time since the divorce had already been filed for other reasons. She is a great mother and a nice person,â said Sebastian. Sebastian isnât looking for any handouts, and has found success as a music artistand studio owner while embracing her role as a single mother with pride. She has said that Swizz Beatz sees his daughter three to four times a year and that theyâre forging a relationship. Read the full story of over at Madame Noire. â Photo: Madame Noire/Jahna Sebastian Soâ¦why did Mashonda blame Alicia for breaking up her marriage again? Swizz was doing her dirty long before that. This lady says he even acted like a single man during their relationship in 2007. What a mess.  Guess my first comment wasnât approved, so Iâll try again.  My question was why would a woman just sleep with a man before knowing him well, or at least well enough to know he was married.  I think some women really donât care or want to know.  Point blank, asking would be a step in the right direction.  So he didnât act like he was married.  That really doesnât mean anything.  Donât a lot of men act like theyâre not married especially in the rap and hip hop world?  He was a producer and she was an artist trying to get a start.  Enough said.   50 Centâs Baby Mama Alleges He Used To BeatÂ Her Main menu Uh Oh: Sources Say Bobbi Kristina Never Asked Cissy Houston For Her Blessing Yelawolf Posts Pics Of Himself Draped In Confederate Flag [PHOTOS] A-Rod Banned For 162 Games And Will Not Play At All In 2014 Join the Conversation!

Leave a Reply See waymentâ¦ Boosie has been hot since heâs been released from prison. The rapper has had beacoup shows and stays in the studio. He plans to release two albums and a whole lot of other positive things are going on, and his baby mama wants a piece.  Â  One of his baby mamas, Walnita Decuir, has penned a tell all book, âWhen The Music Stops.â If you remember, she smuggled some weed into the prison for him and ended up serving 18 months. It sounds like the typical I held him down but then he left me for someone else. The names are fictional but this is based on a true story, according to information from the book. Peep the excerpt:   Whatâs crazy is apparently he left her for Deiondra Sanders (daughter of Deion Sander), and Deiondra has been hinting at this for a while now. I swear it seems a bit far fetched butÂ the two are an item or at least were. Homegirl even went to court with Boosie. Check out these photos:     Â  I guess when the reality show didnât get picked up, she turned to writing books. Chile, Iâm done for the day!

Meet Mathew Knowlesâ 2nd Baby Mama TaQoya BranscombÂ (Photos) Main menu Related Articles	 Leave a Comment VIDEO VIEWS Activity Feed on Facebook Featured Bloggers Most Recent Posts Follow âAtlanta Daily Worldâ Also On Atlanta Daily World: Wednesday, February 17 According to multiple media reports, Mathew Knowles was really getting âturnt upâ in 2010. That was the year that he impregnated his first baby mama outside of his marriage,Â Alexsandra Wright, who gave birth to their child, Nixon. It is also apparent that Knowles, 63, also allegedly knocked upÂ Taqoya Branscomb in 2010, a Houston native. 2010 has proven to be a nightmare year for Knowles. It was also the year that his former wife, Tina Knowles, filed for divorce. And it about that timeÂ that BeyoncÃ© fired Mathew KnowlesÂ as her manager. On top of it all, at 30 years of age, the new baby mama Branscomb is younger than Knowlesâ own daughter BeyoncÃ©, which probably doesnât sit very well with the family. Branscomb is a real estate agent and former model. So, unlike Wright, who didnât get the child support she desperately needed and had to move into a homeless shelter, Branscomb appears to be a self-sufficient businesswoman and hustler. But that doesnât mean she doesnât want Knowles to cut a child support check. In fact, Branscomb went to Harris County courthouse to request a paternity test, get child support and then have Knowles pay for her attorney fees. If Wright could speak to Branscomb right now, sheâd probably say âgood luck getting those checks.â Take a look at photos of Knowlesâ 2nd alleged baby mamaÂ Taqoya Branscomb.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11Next page Â» Tags: Alexsandra Wright Â» another mathew knowles paternity suit Â» beyonce Â» Mathew Knowles Â» mathews sued by another woman Â» TaQoya Branscomb Â» tina knowles Sign up for the Atlanta Daily World Digital Daily!

Oh heavens, yes! I wish this was all real :) I am 5â10â I ALWAYS break my base with a 7N and then use bleach with 30 volume developer for the highlights! For every two highlights I pull one lowlight through with the 7N! If that makes no sense to you, thats okay, just tell all of that to your hair dresser! I am addicted to Estee Lauder Double Wear Foundation! It is so fabulous and lasts all day long and you hardly need any, it goes a long way! I use my beauty blender or Sephora #46 brush to blend it. You can shop all my make up product must haves â here Yes, I have tried a ton of them but Kate Somerville Tanning Towelettes are my favorite!  TEE: Maj Tees c/o // BLAZER: Shopbop (25% off with code INTHEFAMILY14) // MATERNITY JEANS: NordstromÂ Â HEELS: REISS c/o // SUNGLASSES: Karen Walker // BAG: YSL via Fashionphile // LIPSTICK: MAC âCoral BlissâÂ WATCH: Michael Kors Photos by Ashlee Brooke Photography I went through an obsession with blazers last year and literally bought one in every color and for a while forgot how much I love them! I went through my closet and re fell in love with blazers â I love throwing them on over a printed tee (obsessed with this baby mama one!) or even just a plain tee and a slick bun. Speaking of baby mamaâsâ¦ this pregnancy is getting to the point where it is extra hard to dress the bump! I mean there are so few styles that work with a big belly (while not feeling like you look huge haha) and lets be honest some days I just want to be in my sweat pants and a big, comfy tee all day long. I am sure if you are pregnant or have been you know those days when you try on 10 million things and just donât feel cute in any and end up crying or something and your husband has to try and make you feel better?? Please tell me you can relate haha. I actually love LOVE love dressing the bump 95% of the time BUT there are those days of course  luckily blazers are one thing that I found totally work with the bump and have been a go to lately! Hope you are all having a good week! xox

Where is the baby mama tee from? Thanks! My sister wants one ð Hi Amber
I totally know how you feel! (I am 30 weeks at the moment)
I was actually having one of those tearful days when I found your website & it has given me so much inspiration. You look great!
Lisa xxx Aw congrats!!! 30 weeks, you are just right behind me! And girl, I swear every pregnant woman has those days so donât feel bad! Totally normal! I think its hard when you have the bump to feel good 100% of the time because of all the weight gain but I have never seen a pregnant woman I didnât think was beautiful so just know its only you who feels that way everyone else thinks youâre a beauty! (easy to say not to hear haha should be saying this to myself too!) xx Girl, I can totally relate to those days and Iâm not even pregnant!! It makes me feel better that someone as perfect as you has them too haha. You look gorgeous as always! Iâm still a few years (and an upcoming wedding) away from getting pregnant but Iâll definitely have to come back to these posts for some style inspo when Iâm carrying my first little one. Who knows, maybe your 2nd or 3rd pregnancy will coincide with my first and I could get maternity style inspiration from your current posts at that time too!  Haha k good I am glad it happens to you too!! And yeah hopefully one of our pregnancies will coincide!!  Thanks for your sweet comment!! xx Aww you amazing prego yes the feeling of, just wanting to lay around,and be comfy but i bet you. Could post some, comfy cloths prego,and still be amazingly gorgoes. Being,a mom is,the best thing,in,the world. Aw thank you! And yes comfy pregnant is the way to be!

You always look so incredibly cute, and Iâm sure you still would even if you wore sweats, so donât worry ð If it makes you feel better, I looked sorta like a  baby whale with acne. It was terrible.  Worth it, obviously âcause little boys are the best!! (Also I think itâs great youâre my age, married, and going to have a baby. I kinda feel like the odd man out sometimes, so itâs nice to be reminded that Iâm not the only one!).  Anyways, sorry for the really long and sorta creepy, personal comment.

Aw so fun!! He sounds darling!! That makes me so excited for a boy!  So wish I had seen this tee when I was pregnant with my girls! You look Gorgeous Amber!

I really hope itâs not true and something tells me Omarionâs mama is behind all this . via: BlackMediaScoop Omarion and his Love & Hip Hop star girlfriend Apryl have reportedly split and itâs all because Apryl refused to give her son a DNA test to prove heâs Omarionâs. Word on the street is Apryl and Omarion seem to have a very good relationship â but Omarionâs mom has been starting some drama. According to sources, Omarionâs mom has been hinting around that the baby looks bi-racial. She also mentioned that Aprylâs ex boyfriend is Mexican. If this aint some juicy mess! That baby does look Mexicanâ¦just sayinâ lol! So a source claims that after months of mama spitting that HATE into Omarionâs ear, he started having second thoughts about paternity. The source says âOmarion asked for a DNA test, and Apryl was offended . . . she started crying and carrying on.â The insider continued, âAfter Apryl calmed down Omarion asked again and she still said no.â Blac Chyna Puts Tyga On BLAST After Break Up!  Â  So the source claims Omarion ended up dumping Apryl! Oh and did we mention that all of this was caught on camera and will be shown later this season on Love And Hip Hop Hollywood!

You'll Love   Mel Gibson has more than $450 million in his coffers, but his ex only has $10 in her pockets. The woman at the center of Gibsonâs epic audio rants and bitter custody battle, Oksana Grigorieva, has filed bankruptcy, according to docs obtained by CB!  Grigorieva filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy last month citing $48K in assets, but she owes more than $438,000. The Russian beauty was thrust into the limelight when it was revealed she and the former $900 million man were having an affair and later a love child, 4-year-oldÂ Lucia, which broke up his 31-year marriage. Then, who can forget those explosive audio recordings that led to a criminal investigation of the 58-year-old when he made death threats and told the singer âyou deserved itâ after she said he hit her and broke her teeth. It also exposed Gibsonâs priceless breathless quotes like âI deserve to be blown first! Before the f*cking Jacuzzi! Ok, Iâll burn the goddamn house up, but blow me first!.â And whatâs become all too familiar territory for Gibson, including slurs against Hispanics and the N-word. Grigorievaâs recent money woes include only $7,500 in child support funds (BTW, Gibson pays her $2,500 a month), $300 in her bank account, $8,000 in furniture, her very own artwork worth a mere $500, a $5,000 piano, $2,000 in clothing, $1,500 in jewelry, and a modest $15,000 Dodge Charger. Most of her outstanding financial obligations are credit card debts, including a whopping $200,000 in legal and court fees no doubt when it came to battling her famous ex in front of the judge.

												 NBA star Paul George, in a âgross insultâ to women, has branded the mother of his baby girl an unfit parent â because sheâs a full-time mom, a Manhattan matrimonial lawyer charged on Friday. âSheâs unemployed because she has a 2-month-old child,â lawyer Raoul Felder said of his client, Daniela Rajic, outside Manhattan Supreme Court. âThis is grossly insulting to women.â The Indiana Pacers forward has claimed in his custody suit that awarding shared custody would be âdetrimentalâ to the child, the Indiana Pacers forward claims in his custody suit because Rajic has ârefused to seek or gain employment and is dependent upon others for the care of her child.â Rajic has been living with family in Middle Village, Queens, since giving birth to baby Olivia on May 1. The ex-stripper dressed demurely for her court appearance Friday in a white button-down shirt and black pants. But the hearing was adjourned until a federal judge decides whether the matter should be held in Florida, where George filed the custody suit, or New York, where she has filed her own. Felder called Georgeâs case for custody of Olivia especially âabsurdâ because the big-bucks dad is asking Rajic â who has no assets â for child support. George has a five-year, $95 million contract with the Pacers. The hoops star has never met the child, sent a gift or paid her a dime in support, Rajic told The Post. George says that if the court awards Rajic custody, he wants to pay less than state guidelines, according to court papers. George filed his suit in Miami last week. Rajic was just served with the papers, almost a month after she sued him in Manhattan for sole custody and support. In her suit, Rajic argues that George is the unfit parent because he is constantly on the road.
Rajic brightened Friday when talking about her daughter. âShe is an angel, a perfect baby,â the buxom brunette told The Post. âOnly recently heâs had an interest in seeing the child,â Felder said, adding that the timing coincides with the filing of the suits. A spokesman for George insisted there be a paternity test. âAs we have said repeatedly, If there is a paternity test that is legally binding, Mr. George will embrace his responsibilities as a father and provide emotional and financial support to the child,â the rep said in a statement. In his Florida custody petition, George admits to meeting the former Tootsieâs cabaret dancer in Miami and being in a sexual relationship with her from June to August but says he wants âreputable, scientific testingâ to prove he is the father.

A Recent History of Sports Baby Mama Drama Michael Turner Channels Our Sites A Recent History of Sports Baby Mama Drama NowTrending NowTrending Baby Mamas: Maria Grissom, Rasheeda Walker, and allegedly many moreMichael Turner's alleged fifth baby mama, Maria Grissom, launched a "get to know your baby" Twitter campaign with a picture of their daughter and a not so subtle caption of "Michael Turner daughter, my sweetie... Let's pray he decide to see her one day this year." Besides being called out in 160 characters or less, Turner made headlines last year for reportedly breaking up a girl-on-girl fight at his home between a golf club wielding Elizabeth Delacruz (his then-girlfriend) and Rasheeda Walker (one of his five baby mamas).  The Baby Mama Syndrome What is The Baby Mama Syndrome? Can we simplify that definition? OK, so thatâs not very simple.Â  Try again. Get the Book Circumstances PeopleÂ  Relationships Behaviors Negative effects Comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Recent Posts About Robert Doyel Sign-Up for Email Updates About Judge Doyel Connect with Me Categories Looking for Something? Judge Doyel July 22, 2014 by Robert Doyel 6 Comments  Baby mamas are unwed mothers of any age.Â  The fathers of their children are baby daddies.Â Â âBaby mama dramaâ has become a common expression for the many conflicts associated with baby mamas. Â Less well known is âbaby daddy trauma,â which refers mostly to domestic or other violence committed by a baby daddy.Â  âDramaâ and âtraumaâ donât begin to describe all the issues included in the Baby Mama Syndrome. Dictionary definitions of syndrome often describe âa constellation ofâ symptoms, things, events etc. related to a certain condition.Â  A syndrome is also defined as âa predictable patternâ of circumstances, behaviors, events etc. associated with a particular social condition.Â Â Unwed pregnancies and births are the socialÂ condition weâre dealing with here. I define the Baby Mama Syndrome as the constellation of circumstances, people, relationships, behaviors, and negative effects related in any way to two people making a baby together when they are not married to each other.Â  It is not a medical or psychological diagnosis, although some of the negative effects on individual baby daddies and especially on baby mamas and their children can be both psychological and medical. Iâll try.Â  The Baby Mama Syndrome starts with two people who are not married to each other conceiving a child together. The Baby Mama Syndrome involves the baby mama, the baby daddy, their biological relatives and in-laws, as well as other baby mamas and baby daddies with âtiesâ to the baby mama or baby daddy, plus friends, the police, the court system, society, taxpayers, and, of course, the child. The Syndrome includes any behavior by any of those people or institutions that would not have happened if the baby had never been conceived.Â  It can also include living arrangements, employment, and lifestyle.Â  In fact, it includes just about anything related to the two unmarried parents. We all suffer from the Baby Mama Syndrome.Â Â The number of illegitimate births in our country every year is huge, and this phenomenon hasÂ changed our culture forever, with lasting negative effects on individuals (especially the children), governments, and society. We start with two people who are not married to each otherÂ having sex resulting in the female getting pregnant.Â  Well, thatâs not really the start.Â  Letâs look at the five components of my definition of the Baby Mama Syndrome, starting with âcircumstances.â Celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Halle Berry, and Dwight Howard make unwed pregnancies look like no big deal.Â  But celebrities often have lots of money to help solve their problems, although their wealth isnât always enough. Most baby mamas and baby daddies are poor, canât afford health care for themselves or their children, and have trouble putting food on the table.Â  Many have to live with parents or grandparents.Â  A large proportion of them didnât intend to make a baby at all. They may be in committed relationships, just dating, or hooking up the night they meet.Â  They may be married to someone else and make a baby while having an extramarital affair. Baby mamas may be children themselves or in their forties, and baby daddies can be any age from puberty on up.Â  A quarter of a million teen-agers became baby mamas last year, some of them for the second, third, and even fourth times. Baby mamas and baby daddies can be any race, ethnic group, or religion. A shocking array of people may be brought into the troubles of baby mamas and their baby daddies.Â  The baby mama many times is in conflict with some other woman who is seeing the baby daddy or has a child with him.Â  The other woman is her âromantic rival,â according to academic experts. Friends, neighbors, the older children of one of the parents, relatives, even strangers canÂ get caught up in the problems.Â  The police are called, a judge puts one or both parents in jail or on probation, court staff and child support enforcement personnel have to deal with them, and social workers such as child protective investigators are brought in. And, obviously, there is always at least one baby.Â Â These people and the agencies they work for may be part of a particular Syndrome,Â but all of them are part of the Syndrome we as a society and as taxpayers suffer from. One of the biggest problems in the Baby Mama Syndrome is that relationships between baby mamas and baby daddies are often fleeting and unstable, and new boyfriends and girlfriends move in and out of the homes to the detriment of the kids. Besides the intimate partner relationship between the two unmarried parents, ârelationshipsâ in the Baby Mama Syndrome include any connection any person or agency may haveÂ with the baby mama or baby daddy.Â Â Romantic rivals, friends, grandparents, strangers, hookups, neighbors, the parentsâ other children, current and ex-spouses, live-in boyfriends and girlfriends, fellow workers and bosses, anyone connected in any way with either the baby mama or baby daddy can get caught up in their drama. As time goes on I will introduce you to the wild and often bizarre behaviors of some baby mamas and baby daddies and the others brought into the drama.Â  One woman stalking another is commonplace, especially by phone or on social media like Facebook.Â  Domestic violence occurs frequently.Â  The children may be abused emotionally, physically, or sexually. Some parents have little interest in raising children; others canât or wonât support the kids.Â  Baby mamas account for 85%Â of abortions each year in this country.Â  Some baby mamas or baby daddies drink excessively or abuse drugs, and their behavior can lead to abuse, abandonment, or neglect of their children. If youâve read this far, you get the idea.Â  I have written and will write many thousands of words spelling out in detail the negative effects of the Baby Mama Syndrome.Â  Â Those effects are the unfortunate fallout from a culture that no longer values marriage as a necessary step before making babies, and of several years in which 40% of all babies born in this country have had mothers who were not married and probably didnât want the babies in the first place.

Julie Lucas says  March 10, 2015 at 6:02 pm I just became aware of this book ,I ABSOLUTELY WILL BE PURCHASING ,THIS BOOK BOTH electronically ,and Hard Copy,if both are offered ! I am a âmotherâ of a human being that has been going through this from the second he was born. The father,and I are âPOSTER CHILDâ examples! I am the non custodial parent who has a past of HERION addictin,felony arrest,not going any further than high school (and I still wonder how I even did that! ) and most important a person who has for the past fourteen years disrupted this childâs growth ,and need of a BIOLOGICAL MOTHER not a woman who just had a baby, So this is the place Iâll often visit and be a part of (the book ,website,any a any other means of EDUCATION, involving this subject. I want to thank this judge for making this  literature available,this willbeen the ONE source of truth,on every level,emotional social,personal,spiritual,legal and any other facet that involves this HORRIBLE SYNDROME 
Robert Doyel says  March 10, 2015 at 8:15 pm Thank you for your soul-baring post.  I hope my writing will be as educational and as useful as you think.  My second book on Baby Mama Syndrome Violence is in the rewrite stage and I hope to have it published by early summer.  The third one, though, should be right on the mark for you.  Children of the Baby Mama Syndrome is about half written.  It will focus on bad things that happen to the kids and on manipulation by parents, including abuse of the court system. The first book is available now in hardback and paperback online at Amazon and Barnes & Noble.  Ebooks are available for Kindle, Nook, and iPhones, iPads etc at Amazon, B&N, and iTunes.  I still have a supply of hardbacks which I can autograph if you prefer that.  If you want one from me, email me at robertdoyel@judgedoyel.com.  We will have to figure out how I can get it to you. 
Trish says  March 13, 2015 at 2:44 pm I totally agree with that you were saying about baby mama syndrome!  As an educator in a preschool, I see baby mamas all the time.  At one time, I had 10 children in my class, 8 whose parents were not married.  Some were living in the abuse shelter.  There were court orders against some baby daddies.  The children had very little food in their lunches, and what was there was unhealthy, processed food.  The children would act out inappropriately, which made us wonder what they were seeing at home.  The children whose parents were married seemed happier and less aggressive in the classroom.  Thank  you for the article! 
Robert Doyel says  March 13, 2015 at 3:00 pm I am learning as I go along that educators and nurses are more in a position to know about The Baby Mama Syndrome than most people.  I appreciate your affirmation.  I hope you looked at the rest of my website and saw that Iâve written a book that contains a whole lot more information than the one blog post. 
Maria says  July 20, 2015 at 6:00 am Iâm a âbaby mommaâ statistic but I wasnât a drug addict nor had any domestic violence or anyrhing like that. My case was purely that I was extremely naive and uneducated when I began to have a sexual relationship. I think your upbringing has much to do with it as my parents were extremely conservative and I wasnât even allowed to date until I was 18 not to mention we never had any sex ed. conversations. Sex was taboo and not an openly discussed topic. Needless to say that I fell head over heels for a guy and thought he was âthe oneâ. I have a step father who has other children with an ex wife so when I met who I thought was Mr.Rightâ¦.little did I know he was actually Mr. Wrong!! He had 2 children already with a baby mamma and I had never experienced drama like that! I was young and so in love and thought I could âfix itâ.  I always knew that marriage was important and I practically begged him for us to get married, but that didnât happen.  I hung on for a little while longer dealing with the baby mama drama until I found myself in the same predicament and became pregnant at 20 and held on 2 more years until I got pregnant again and then I made a decision to leave becuase I couldnât live like that any longer. I became a baby mama and have worked very hard to provide stability and a âdrama freeâ household for my 2 children. Their father pays child support but does not exercise any visitation rights and I have never forced my children on him. The father is back with first baby mama and I think they are still not married (10 yrs later)I only contact him for urgent matters like the kids needing a passaport and legal matters like that. Iâm a baby mama/single mother and my bad decision has cost me many years of struggles, but thankfully we are not on welfare and I work very hard to educate them and try to give them the tools they need to make wiser decisions than the ones I made. I am sadly a baby mama but gladly without the drama. 
Robert Doyel says  July 20, 2015 at 7:48 pm Maria, you are a brave woman for putting your story online for all to see. You describe issues in your life that I have seen in hundreds and hundreds of court cases. The difference between many of those cases and your situation is you. You may not have been mature and obviously werenât equipped by your parents or schools to deal with the issues you confronted, but you are handling it all responsibly and with wisdom.

Here we go again.  Last week Nasâ daughterâs mother Carmen Bryan was reportedly trying to have him jailed for contempt of court for failing to pay $11K in back child support/tuition for their daughter Destiny. Now in a weekend interview with the Hip-Hop Socialite she reveals she doesnât want to see him behind bars, she just wants him to get help for his âmental health issues.â Yikesâ¦  Peep the excerpts below: On Media Reports That She Wants Nas To Be Jailed: âI do not want to see my childâs father go to jail. However, I do want to see him get the mental help that I believe he desperately needs. So this situation is a curse and a blessing with regard to the fact that there are some deep-rooted mental issues that I believe exist and need to be addressed.â On Her Beliefs About Nasâ Mental Health Issues: âWell first off, let me just say my experiences with Nas, my dealings with Nas, and my research all lead me to believe that he does suffer from bipolarism and he may be a paranoid schizophrenic.   Thatâs my personal opinion based on my experiences and interaction with him.  An incident occurred with Nas years ago when we were together. I came in the house, Destiny and I, and he was on the couch wrapped up in a blanket; his mom was on one side of him, his brother on the other side, there were a few more people in the house. My first reaction was, âIs everything okay? What happened?â And thatâs when Nas told me ghosts were haunting him again, and entities were whispering to him and touching him and bothering him.  This is something that he mentioned when we first got together, but I had never experienced him ever experiencing it until that moment. So, Iâve witnessed this long battle with insanity.â Whoa. Do you believe her? With all the stuff that she revealed when her book came out â why no mention of mental health issues before in her dealings with the press? Nasâ mother died before he married Kelis, so why not mention this incident before?  Hit the flip for Carmenâs explanation for why she decided to take the issue over Destinyâs tuition to court and what she claims Kelis had to say about his alleged mental health issues.

Weâve seen makeups, breakups, shade, and twitter feuds as our favorite celebrities try to navigate the the ins and outs of their non-traditional family situations. Here are 15 kinds of celebrity baby drama making headlines these days. Image Source: Instagram.com Weâre glad that Ciara is taking the high road and getting along with all three of Futureâs baby mamaâs, but this Instagram publicity shot of the whole team feelsâ¦awkward. Does anyone smell a reality show in the mix? Iâm sorryâ¦ Chris Bosh is on the road 10 months out of the yearâ¦ how he could win custody is weird to meâ¦. these courts need to change how much these chicks get in CS and watch all the babies stop popping upâ¦ these chicks use these babies as their golden tickets. I donât like that term baby mama either! As long as âless than smartâ women continue having kids with guys who
they think have money and will take care of them, they will more than
likely continue to become baby mamas, and as long as âless than smartâ
women continue getting with guys who have multiple kids with multiple
women, there will more than likely be baby mama drama. The Secret- Jamie Foxx; that âs NO way to date; if sheâs good enough for you to get all up in between and plant your seed then she should be good enough for you to escort out in public.  There is more to this because it doesnât make sense; Chris Bosh- #LOSER!!!!  Heâd rather take custody of their daughter from his college girlfriend then pay the proper amount of child support.  Also, if the girl is a CLOSE friend of mine and I knew her man was steppin out then I would tell her but if its someone that Iâm not that close to, Iâll let her find out on her own.  Not trying to see anyone get dogged out but you know how females are; they are so in love with the man that if you try to be a friend and pull her coat tails to the situation you end up being a hater and jealous and wanting their man.  Ainât nobody got time for that!!! Chris Bosh is a jerk As long as âless than smartâ women continue having kids with guys who they think have money and will take care of them, they will more than likely continue to become baby mamas, and as long as âless than smartâ women continue getting with guys who have multiple kids with multiple women, there will more than likely be baby mama drama. Jamie, Jamie, Jamie at some point one of your baby mamas will go public.  Go ahead and make a stupid move to make one of them mad.  They will get paid if they are not already. These cases I donât even feel sorry for.   Some of these men and women need to sit down and stop producing children. I think jamie foxx is weird just like his weird azz hairline HAHA, I am so glad I wasnât the only one who got side tracked by the hair line. lol itâs like dudeâ¦just let it goâ¦itâs goneâ¦GONE! Iâm so glad Iâm not the only one.  Iâm tired of these dudes and their spray on hairlinesâ¦you to Brian White. wtf is up with jamie hair line Jaime went âHollywoodâ a few years ago.  I like people so much better in the beginning but he went and got his mouth fixed and it looks like heâs had other work done.  Donât get me wrong, if you need 8 root canals and donât want to spend the extra money for 8 crowns then by all means do your thing but he went an got caps put on his teeth. UGH! this is why the bible put so much emphasis on marriage before kids. this is EXACTLY WHY! There are reasons for things being called âthe right wayâ Amen!  These people just donât have any moraleâs or values.  Just go to bed with any man or women without a thought then you want to complain about support.  These people are so stupid! you know not EVERYONE believes in your bible right? i didnât say that anybody had to. the bible is really just a guide to a good life. most of the things in it are common sense. if you get married and stay committed to each other, you wonât have any baby mama drama. itâs simple You date people who are just like you, so if youâre in to foolishness and drama, youâre going to date people who bring right along with them.

[â¦]  Did Cop Murder Mother of His Child for Refusing Abortion? READ THIS. list 1 Did Cop Murder Mother of His Child? Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast Kate Briquelet Horrific 08.14.15 5:15 AM ET Kate Briquelet She lived to help victims of crime. But after two years as a crisis counselor for Texas police, Samantha Dean tragically became a victim herself.

The 29-year-old Austin woman was seven months pregnant when deputies discovered her body in the parking lot of a vacant shopping center. She had worked for the Kyle Police Department, where co-workers were planning a baby shower for her future daughter, whom sheâd named Madeline.

Deanâs life was cut short sometime before 2 a.m. on Feb. 4, when a deputy found her shot in the head three timesâonce at close range, an autopsy showed. A black plastic bag covered her face. The back seat of her Dodge Charger had been removed.

The alleged motive for her murder is chilling: VonTrey Clarkâthe father of her unborn babyâallegedly hired hit men because Dean refused to have an abortion and wanted child support, authorities charge.

On Wednesday, more disturbing details of the alleged hit job were revealed in a search warrant for Clarkâs locker at an Austin police substation.

Texas authorities and the FBI early on named Clark as the chief suspect in Deanâs slaying but havenât charged him with a crime.

Clark allegedly offered $5,000 to have Dean killed, the latest search warrant affidavit charges. Investigators say Clarkâs associate, Aaron Lamont Williams, 32, told them that Clark drove Dean to the parking lot where she was found slain.
 Williams allegedly claimed that Clarkâs buddy and former roommate Kevin Watsonâin jail on an unrelated drug chargeâadmitted to killing the mother-to-be with the help of a man named Freddie Smith. The hit men wanted to make it look like a drug deal gone wrong, according to the affidavit.  Cops also arrested Watsonâs girlfriend, Kyla Fisk, on charges of tampering with evidence for her role in allegedly hiding the clothes Watson wore the night of the slaying, the Austin American-Statesman reported.

Evidence suggests Dean feared her longtime lover before she was murdered. In a January 21 diary entry, Dean described an encounter in which Clark handcuffed her while wearing his uniform and gun. âDean felt at one point Clark was going to kill her,â authorities said in a July search warrant affidavit.

Dean reportedly also told Kyle Police Department colleagues that if something happened to her, Clark was behind it.

The couple was on-again, off-again for the last six years, Clark said, according to court documents. He allegedly told investigators their relationship was a secret because he was with another woman.

Police say his whereabouts were mostly unaccounted for the night of the murder. His girlfriend told cops he left his house at 8:30 p.m. on February 3 after they had a fight, and she found it bizarre that he left his cellphone and pager at the residence.

Clark told investigators he drove to a nearby school and sat in his car before walking around, according to a search warrant. Police say there is no surveillance footage of him doing so. He checked into a police substation around midnight, court documents reveal. Police said a Los Angeles-area number called Dean the night of her death, and text messages seemed to lead her to the abandoned shopping center. Authorities placed four cellphones, including Deanâs own, near the crime scene and said they were active around the time of her death, the American-Statesman reported.  Meanwhile, five days after Deanâs murder, Williams sent threatening text messages to an Austin Police Department crisis counselor, authorities charge in court records.  âI [expletive] got her. I am going to get him, then Iâm coming for you,â the text said. âI will show you what a crisis is.â According to the warrant, parties including Clark, Watson, Fisk, and Williams had conversations in which they discussed not snitching to police and distancing themselves from each other, KXAN reported. In July, Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo announced that Clark was suspended indefinitely for refusing to attend an in-person interview, then skipping an Internal Affairs hearing days later. Pending the investigation, Clark was not permitted to leave his home without permission, Acevedo said.Â  Cops soon discovered Clark flew to Indonesiaâa country that does not have an extradition treaty with the U.S.âon July 17.  âIf you have any dignity, any semblance of humanity, Mr. Clark, get back on that plane and come back to Austin,â Acevedo said during a July 23 news conference.  Clarkâs attorney, Bristol Myers, told KXAN that the former officer flew to Indonesia for a medical procedure.  âOfficer Clark booked an international round-trip flight in his own name, used his own passport, and was easily located. These are not the hallmarks of a fugitive,â Myers told the TV station. This month, authorities announced the FBI captured Clark in Indonesia but that heâs being held on a visa-related issue. Itâs unclear when he will return to the U.S. 

 Some relatives of Dean said they didnât know Clark and had never met him. 

 âThroughout the pregnancy, she had nothing to do with him,â Michaela Garth, Deanâs cousin, told The Daily Beast. âWe didnât know much of him until this situation happened. Nobody really knew who the father was.â

 Deanâs mother, Kimberly, declined to comment on Clark. She would only tell People that her daughter and husband discussed the father of Deanâs child. 

 âWe were a little concerned initially, mostly about the financial end of it,â Kimberly told the magazine last week. âBut she was a very good person and a great daughter, so we told her it was going to be okay. Weâd do what we needed to do.â Kimberly Dean told The Daily Beast that her daughterâwho had two bachelorâs degrees and one masterâsâwanted to be a detective. But after overcoming a rare form of cancer in her elbow at age 18, she could not pass physical tests required to become a police officer. Instead, she took a job as the Kyle Police Departmentâs first and only victimsâ services coordinator.  âMy daughter was a wonderful person,â Kimberly Dean said. âShe let people feel they could be whoever they wanted to be and do whatever they wanted to doâ¦ she was a moving motivational speaker for everyone that she met.â The grieving mom said one of her daughterâs biggest accomplishments was staying in school throughout 15 separate surgeries, along withÂ chemotherapy and radiation treatments, after being diagnosed with cancer. She later attended New Yorkâs John Jay College of Criminal Justice for her masterâs in forensic psychology, commuting four hours each way from Virginia to attend classes, Kimberly Dean said. Kimberly didnât want to discuss the murder investigation or the headlines surrounding Clark. âItâs tragic, and itâs sad,â Kimberly Dean said. âItâs something that could happen to anyone. Thatâs what people need to be aware ofâit could happen to anyone.â

You'll Love   Chris Brownâs baby drama continues.  Earlier this week, it was revealed the 25-year-old rapper is a fatherÂ to 9-month-old baby Royalty. The baby mama is 31-year-old Nia Guzman-Amey, and sheÂ also happened to beÂ married to another man for over 10 years whenÂ herÂ affair with Brown and subsequentÂ pregnancy happened. According to TMZ, Brown and the former model will now be headed to family court because he believes she leaked the story about Royalty. Â  Brown reportedly found out about their love child about a month ago, andÂ made a deal with Nia in exchange for her staying silent about the news. Chris is currently paying her substantially more than he would be if they had court-ordered child support. TMZ notes, âThereâs a scale on how much a parent pays, based largely on income. Weâre told Chris upped that amount and in return demanded that she keep her lips sealed.â His lawyers are in the process of draftingÂ the legal documents so that he can ask a judge for an order requiring him to pay child support. Resultantly, heâll actually pay his baby mama less than he is currently. Meanwhile, Chris Brownâs ex Karrueche TranÂ hasÂ seemingly been celebrating her public breakup. The model has been posting party pics to her Instagram ever since the news broke.

According to a new report, his baby mama, Josie Harris, has plans to sue the boxer for lying about their infamous 2010 domestic violence incident!

It appears things aren't going well between Chris Brown and Nia Guzman, with whom he shares one child. The pair have been locked in a nasty battle over custody and child support for many months now, with new reports suggesting Guzman, 31, is asking for a pretty hefty payout. Brown, 26, gave viewers some insight into his tumultuous relationship with GuzmanÂ during a recent Twitter rant. According to E! Online,Â the GrammyÂ winner hopped on the social media site Friday morningÂ to get a few things off his chest. In his first message he said it was shameful that some "females" use children as an easy way of getting money. He added that many men in his situation would have shirked their parental responsibilities, but he chose to take it on head first. In another postÂ he shamed women using their children "as leverage," and praised all the responsible men of the world stepping up to be fathers. Although Brown did not mention Guzman's name it appears clear that he is making reference to their current situation with daughter Royalty.Â  Some men my age run from their responsibility as fathers. I embrace mine. Just sucks that some females use children as meal tickets. 	â Chris Brown (@chrisbrown) August 7, 2015 Using a child as leverage is never ok. The highest praise to the men who actually want their kids. 	â Chris Brown (@chrisbrown) August 7, 2015 As TMZ reported Monday,Â Guzman is believed to have filed legal paperwork requesting a change in their current visitationÂ agreement and wantsÂ Brown to pay close to $15,000 in child support.Â She reportedlyÂ asked that BrownÂ be granted supervised visits only as she did not feel that he was responsible enough to care for Royalty, 1, on his own. She is reportedly seeking full custody as she fears it is detrimental to Royalty to be around Brown and his friends asÂ many of his associates have allegedÂ substance abuse issues. Guzman's concerns over her daughter's safety came after several incidents occurred at Brown's Los Angeles home. On July 15,Â the R&B singer's home was broken into by armed intruders. The suspects locked Brown's aunt, who was in the home during the incident, in a closet as they rummaged through his belongings. They were able to get away with money and other items. His home was broken into once prior in May by a fan who stripped down and spent several days inside the home. The 21-year-old woman is said to have spray painted "I love you" and "Mrs. Brown" on numerous surfaces in the home, including kitchen counters and across the side of two of his vehicles. Fortunately,Â Royalty was not present during either incident.Â  The IBT Pulse Newsletter keeps you connected to the biggest stories unfolding in the global economy.

Chris Brown had a $10k agreement in place with his baby mama,Â Nia GuzmanÂ â¦ but when she shipped little RoyaltyÂ off to hang with Chris' mom, he cut her off.Â  Sources close to Nia tell TMZ ... Royalty's parents finally came to an agreement on child support ... settling on $10k per month from CB, starting July 1. As we reported, Chris' camp said Nia initially wanted $15k, but he only wanted to pay $2,500. Â  Weâre told the new deal blew up though, when Daddy wanted Royalty this week -- but she was already hanging with grandma in Virginia. Since relations between Chris and his mom have been bad for years nowÂ ... our sources say Chris got pissed. Â Â  We're told Nia's claiming this is the first time she's ever denied Chris visitation, but looks like once was enough. We broke the story ... Chris is filing to establish paternityÂ in court, so a judge can settle their child support and custody issues.Â  According our sources, Nia never wanted to go to court because she didnât want to seem like a gold digger.Â   HERE'S THE RUNDOWN The Weeknd's Big Night Ended Face-to-Face with Police Kaley Cuoco May Have a New Man: Sam Hunt!

 Manny Pacquiao Wearing Nike   Gilbert Arenas is about to lose access to his 4 children if his baby mama has her way ... and it's all over a 15 second video of their 8-year-old son on the hood of a moving vehicle. Gilbert was on "TMZ Live" Tuesday and scoffed at baby mama Laura Govan's allegation he's a reckless parent by putting little Alijah on the front of a Polaris Slingshot and driving at around 15 MPH.  Gilbert told us he got an email from Laura's people saying they were going to try and take custody away from him, and TMZ Sports has learned he told the truth. Our sources say Laura -- who currently has primary physical custody -- will go to court and ask the judge to significantly reduce Gilbert's visitation. She also wants the judge to impose safeguards so the kids aren't put in dangerous situations. As one Laura source put it, "This is just the straw that broke the camel's back. He's done many other things." In case you didn't know, Gilbert and Laura have been at war for several years, and it's getting worse ... or as one source put it, "ferocious."Â

 TMZ Live: Paul McCartney: Music Legend REJECTED at Grammy After-Party Kanye West Shopping at Jacob & Co.  A lot of rappers run for the hills when they knock up some random chick, but Chris Brown wants to move that random chick to the hills ... the Hollywood Hills, so he can be close to his little girl. TMZ broke the story ... Chris gotÂ Nia Guzman, a 31-year-old Houston woman, pregnant and now he's the proud dad of 9-month-old Royalty. We know Chris has spent time with the baby since finding out he's the father, but it's difficult because Royalty is 1372 air miles away from Chris' L.A. home. Sources connected with Chris tell us ... he's asked Nia to move to L.A. with their daughter and he'll foot the bill for housing. He's not romantically involved with Nia, but we're told he genuinely wants a meaningful relationship with Royalty. He's saying he'd like to see her every day. Chris is in "negotiations" with Nia over support. He's paying her more than he's required to under the law, but he got pissed off when she started talking about their relationship and vowed to go to court where a judge would reduce the child support he's informally paying. Our sources say Chris has told Nia, if she moves to L.A. he won't pull the trigger on a child support court case and she'll continue getting the premium amount, in addition to a place to live. Nia hasn't decided, but it sounds like a good deal.   HERE'S THE RUNDOWN The Weeknd's Big Night Ended Face-to-Face with Police Kaley Cuoco May Have a New Man: Sam Hunt!

 (Getty Images) Chris Brown has reportedly asked his baby mama to move to Los Angeles with their daughter Royalty so he can see her âevery day.â As Gossip Cop reported, the bombshell news that Brown had fathered a child broke earlier this month, when it was revealed he was dad to a 9-month-old baby girl. The baby mama was identified as Nia Guzman (sometimes reported to be Nia Gonzalez), a Houston-based model whom Brown had partied with on occasion. Brown only recently found out Royalty is his child, who was apparently conceived while Brown was with on-and-off girlfriend Karrueche Tran. Brown and his camp have yet to comment publicly on the news, but in the weeks since the revelation, Royalty has been photographed backstage at one of the singerâs concerts, and another picture emerged showing a baby bottle on his tour bus. Now TMZ reports Brown wants Guzman to move to Los Angelesâ Hollywood Hills with Royalty, and he will cover all housing costs. While Brown and Guzman are not romantically involved with each other, the star is said to want âa meaningful relationshipâ with his daughter, something that would be difficult if they continue to be separated by more than a 1,000 miles. Upon finding out that he is Royaltyâs father, Brown reportedly began paying Guzman a large amount of child support. But, as Gossip Cop reported, after details leaked to the media, the star was said to have threatened to go to court to have the dollar amount officially set, and likely lowered, by a judge. TMZ, however, says that he and Guzman are currently in ânegotiationsâ over his financial obligation, and that Brown will not take his baby mama to court if she agrees to move. Gossip Cop will continue to have updates.

Ludacris might be newly married to his bride Eudoxie, but he's fighting another woman in court for custody of his toddler daughter, and the whole thing's getting ugly. 
According to TMZ, Tamika Fuller (pictured above on the far right) says the rapper-cum-actor initially wanted her to abort their daughter Cai Bridges when she told him she was pregnant. Fuller says he "offered her $10,000 and a house if she lost the baby." 
	Whoa. Here's hoping none of that story is true. Advertisement

	Fuller recently released images of her daughter with Ludacris earlier this month via Instagram, and she's a cutie.  At least for the sake of Cai Bridges, who has Ludacris's last name, everyone please kiss and make up (or at least be civil with one another).

												 Photo: Teresa Lee/Getty ImagesCelebrity photographer Terry Richardson â the man accused of soliciting sexual favors from young models looking for a break â is going to be someoneâs dad. He announced the news last month on Instagram after The Post printed the scoop. âBabiesâ first Page Six shout out!â he wrote. âSkinny and I are very excited to let you guys know that we are expecting TWINS in the spring!!!â So just who is the woman carrying the future offspring of one of NYCâs most controversial shutterbugs? Meet Alexandra âSkinnyâ Bolotow, the 32-year-old longtime Richardson assistant â and friend of Martha Stewart â who, confidantes say, might finally tame the self-professed âpervertâ once and for all. In the past few years, Richardson â who has photographed everyone from Barack Obama to Lady Gaga â has come under fire for allegedly manipulating models to engage in sexual acts. Model Jamie Peck has recalled a 2010 shoot with him where Richardson offered to make tea with her used tampon, before suggesting Peck manually stimulate him. Another model, Charlotte Waters, says she was Richardsonâs âsex puppetâ during a 2009 gig. âI collaborated with consenting adult women who were fully aware of the nature of the work,â Richardson told Page Six last year in response to the flurry of accusations. Bolotow came to his defense last June in a New York magazine story questioning whether the photographer was a predator. âI think part of being a strong woman is owning the decisions that youâve made in your life,â she said. âTrying to put the onus onto someone else for your own decisions is really cowardly and kind of dishonest.â  Babies' first Page Six shout out! We weren't planning to make this news quite so public quite so soon, because we are very cautious after going through some very difficult and heartbreaking losses, and always afraid of jinxing it, but since the cat is out of the bagâ¦ Skinny and I are very excited to let you guys know that we are expecting TWINS in the spring!!! This has been a difficult journey and we are so thankful to be surrounded by so much love and support from our friends and family, and some incredibly smart doctors! I'm sure the kids will be excited to  use this as a Throwback Thursday one of these days!!! ð¶ð»ð¶ð»ð A photo posted by Terry Richardson (@terryrichardson) on Oct 19, 2015 at 6:57am PDT  Certainly, Bolotow â who grew up in preppy Providence, R.I., where she attended an all-girls Quaker high school â didnât feel preyed upon when she met Richardson in the early aughts, as an undergrad at NYU. âHe was at some downtown party taking pictures and Alex went up to him and was like, âIâd love to work for you,â â an industry insider tells The Post. âShe was with her boyfriend at the time and Terry reportedly said, âIf you suck your boyfriendâs d â â k right here at the party while he holds you upside down, and let me photograph it, Iâll let you work for me.â â She got the job. As an intern, Bolotow posed for Richardson while performing oral sex on him, a âslutâ tiara atop her head. The picture was published in his 2005 book, âKibosh.â Bolotow â who dropped out of NYU to work with Richardson (sheâs since received a degree from Columbia) â has gained a reputation for her donât-give-a-damn antics. The insider recalls hooking up with Bolotow while she was on a 2006 break from Richardson. âShe goes, âAre you sure you want me to go down on you? . . . Because if I do, no [other oral sex] will ever compare to this and [youâll] be ruined for the rest of your life,â â he says.  Happy Hump Day ð¶ð»ð¶ð»ð¼ A photo posted by Terry Richardson (@terryrichardson) on Nov 11, 2015 at 7:53am PST  But friends say thereâs more to Bolotowâs relationship with 50-year-old Richardson than just sex and lewd photos. âHe couldnât function professionally without her,â says the insider. âShe sort of became his art director and muse and boss .â.â. Sheâs extremely opinionated. Terry can be kind of insecure, and Alex definitely gave him confidence.â He even says one image that made it into a past Richardson ad campaign for Sisley was actually shot by Bolotow herself. Sometimes Bolotowâs been too prominent in Richardsonâs professional life, according to Gavin McInnes, a co-founder of Vice Media who worked with Richardson regularly from 2000 to 2005. He was annoyed when, in 2004, Bolotow advised Richardson to pass on starring in a Vice reality show because âit was below him,â McInnes tells The Post. During the decade in which Bolotow has worked with Richardson on and off, their personal relationship has been similarly fluid: Heâs dated several women, including model Susan Eldridge and Audrey Gelman, former spokeswoman for NYC Comptroller Scott Stringer. And while there are perks to dating Richardson â such as spending last Thanksgiving with pal Martha Stewart (who will be at Bolotowâs upcoming baby shower) â those close to the parents-to-be say they are very much in love. âThis wasnât an accidental pregnancy,â says a friend of Bolotowâs. As for Bolotowâs parents, multiple sources tell The Post that her lawyer father is a bit in the dark about his daughterâs salacious shoots with Richardson. âI think people want to think that sheâs an idiot who likes to show her tits off, but sheâs really bright,â says Bolotowâs friend. âWho knows what her next act will be?â One thingâs for sure, she doesnât want to just be known as Richardsonâs baby mama. When declining The Postâs request for an interview, Bolotow emailed: âYou only care about me because of who Iâm fâ-â-âking, which is so lame.â

If the workplace is a window into the American soul, Melissa Brisman Wâ93âs office is a singular slice of motherhood and apple pie. Like many lawyers, she keeps an array of framed diplomas and honorary certificates on a wall close to her desk. And like many parents, she keeps a collection of Crayola and marker drawings closer. In one that hangs within armâs reach of her chair, a blue baby stroller rolls across the top of a page whose lower half depicts a pint-sized stick figure tucked into a little bed. Download a PDF of this article Baby pictures teem on the walls of Brismanâs firm. A giant collage of birth announcements hangs beside the reception doorâperhaps eight square feet crammed with wide-eyed newbornsâand more of equal proportions adorn the cubicles extending back toward Brismanâs office. The babies are part of a group whose number belies the exceptional nature of their parentage. They are among the roughly 2,000 children Brisman has arranged to bring into the world via paid gestational surrogates. The stick-figure baby by Brismanâs desk has special significance, because itâs the work of her genetic daughter, Simmie, who was born to a Pennsylvanian named Barb in 2003. Simmie has her fatherâs open face and smile, and an easygoing sweetness thatâs only halfway reminiscent of her mother, who is not really easygoing at all. Brisman (nÃ©e Melissa Levy) has a way of imbuing even solicitude and heartfelt sympathy with the same hard-charging energy thatâs marked her pioneering career in commercial surrogacy. Classmate Peter Bayard Câ93 remembers her as both an âextremely motivated studentâ and an âextremely sweet, caring, and loyal friend.â The doubled adverb would probably stick to any of Brismanâs traits. The moment I stepped into her New Jersey office she began talking at a pace that, sustained over the course of a long afternoon that ended in the casual family den of her home, yielded a transcript measuring 98 pages of single-spaced text. In the 36 hours after we parted company, she followed up with no fewer than 18 emails, containing everything from links to recent TV appearances to an emotional testimonial about Simmieâs birth mother, composed on her iPhone. But before she became the legal entrepreneur behind one of the first and largest surrogacy agencies in the eastern United Statesâin a state that prohibits pregnancy for payâMelissa Brisman was a young woman medically unable to bear children of her own, and thatâs the place to begin. Â  Brisman grew up in Parsippany, New Jersey, the only daughter of an engineer and a schoolteacher who gave up teaching to raise Melissa and her younger brother. Her childhood memories would seem familiar to many middle-class Americans who came of age in the 1970s and â80s, during what now seems like the twilight of middle-class prosperity. She attended a public high school built two years before she was born. Her family lived modestly but securely, supported by a salary man who dreamed of owning a Cadillac for as long as he drove his ageless Chevy, but waited until Melissa graduated from college to buy one. By that time, Melissaâs medical inability to carry a pregnancy, despite functioning ovaries, was a fact deeply woven into the fabric of her life. âI canât remember when I didnât know,â she says. âMy parents always knew â¦ but you know, your parents are your parents. They downplay it.â The obstetrician-gynecologist she began seeing as a young woman took a slightly different tack. All the way through her college years, he would send her news clippings about babies born to surrogate mothers and advances in fertility medicine. âHe was like my little cheerleader,â Brisman recalls. âHe would be like, âThis is the first baby, like, born this way. This is going to be you.â His patient was plainly not an easy person to thwart. As a high-schooler, Brisman had been so fixated on attending Wharton that she barely applied anywhere else, notwithstanding the apparent odds against her. âNo one in my neighborhood went to an Ivy League school,â she says. âThat was just, like, unheard of.â She received a rejection letterâbut not, one might say, the message it contained. After enrolling at County College of Morris for the summer, Brisman went to SUNY-Binghampton in the fall, âand then I just kept applying, every semester. I just kept applying to Penn. Finally, after a year, they let me in.â She wasted no time proving she belonged, blazing a straight-A path through an undergraduate career that included a stint as vice president of the Wharton Finance Club and culminated with a deanâs award for academic achievement. Yet she remained, in some ways, a fish out of water. âShe was down-to-earth,â says Kelly Spyra Wâ93, who fondly recalls being a beneficiary of Brismanâs knack for coupon cutting and sniffing out two-for-one restaurant deals. Compared to their contemporaries at Wharton, Sprya adds, Brisman was more focused on what she wanted to do with her life and less shy about speaking out when she needed help. For Peter Bayard, now a managing director of Natixis Global Asset Management in New York, Brisman was the suburban antithesis of the haughty Manhattan prep school clique heâd always run with. âI was so used to being friends with the rich, spoiled, materialistic crowdâwhich deep down I wasnât fond of,â he recalls. âAnd then there was Melissaâwho was the opposite of rich, spoiled, and materialistic. âKnowing and being friends with Melissa made me a better person,â he adds. Her âsweet dispositionâ just happened to coexist with a level of drive that could be fearsome or comical, depending on where it was focused. Dan Brisman came into Melissaâs life on a blind date in the wake of a Harvard Law School mixer where she had met his brother. He remembers how, after theyâd dated for a few months, she went about moving their relationship to the next level. âShe decided that we should be engaged before Passover, so she could tell her family,â he laughs after joining us in Melissaâs office, during a slack half-hour between the end of his rounds as a rehabilitation physician and ferrying Simmie from school to Hebrew class. âSo she put her ring size on my refrigerator, so that I would have a clue.â It would become a familiar dynamic. A few years later, desperate to escape the pit of an apartment theyâd been renting, Melissa got her sights set on a house with a big yard in Bergen County. âI wanted to buy this house,â she recalls. âBut, you know what? He had a basketball game.â âNo, we had playoffs!â objects Dan, who remains an avid recreational player. âSo he would not come to see the house.â âIt was playoffs!â âSo I just put a deposit on it and bought it.â Dan saw the house three days later. âI was fine with it.â They still live there. Â  Melissa was barely out of Harvard Law, working as a tax attorney at Goodwin Proctor in Boston, when she set about trying to find a woman to have her children. Had she been able to bear them herself, she doubts she would have started thinking about babies in her early 20s. But in-vitro fertilization was an even longer road in the mid-1990s than it is now. And finding a fertility clinic willing to implant embryos created by her eggs and Danâs sperm into the womb of a paid surrogate proved a tall task. Brisman says five doctors turned her away before Merle Berger, of Boston IVF, agreed to take her on as a patient. Berger had done some training on the West Coast, where more liberal attitudes prevailed around gestational surrogacy. But things were much different in the northeast, and Brismanâs case represented new territory for Bergerâso much so that, as Melissa remembers it, he kept it under wraps from his practice partners. Berger doesnât recall concealing anything, but affirms that heâd never been involved with commercial gestational surrogacy before Brisman sought him out. âThis is somewhat of a Puritan society,â he says. âAnd carrying a baby for somebody else is not something that was considered an acceptable form of treatmentâbecause of the ethical issues involved. And which still are involved. Is it okay to pay a woman to do this? Or is it usurping only poor women who need the money? Itâs a controversial issue, and back then, even more so.â In 1987 Massachusetts had become one of the first states to mandate the coverage of fertility treatment by health insurers. When Brisman attempted to exercise her right to covered IVF procedures, including harvesting her healthy eggs, her insurer denied payment. Since her eggs wouldnât be going back into her own uterus, the company argued, she fell outside of the stateâs mandate. Brisman filed suit. The insurer capitulated, covering the IVF process but requiring her to pay the (much more modest) cost of transferring the embryo into her surrogateâs womb. (Nearly 20 years later, coverage of fertility procedures and surrogacy-related maternity care still varies widely. According to the Henry J. Kaiser Family foundation, 15 states mandate infertility coverage, although many permit exceptions based on religious objections or the size of an employer offering a group insurance plan. Some employer-based insurance plans explicitly exclude maternity care for surrogate pregnancies; others cover it. The Affordable Care Act mandates that plans offered through the ACA marketplace cover maternity care for all pregnancies, but does not mandate infertility treatment.) Finding a surrogate was a challenge of a different sort. Classified ads in The Boston Globe and the Phoenixâan alternative newsweeklyâset Brismanâs phone ringing off the hook. âEvery crazy person on the face of this earth was calling my home,â Brisman remembersâfrom apparent âcocaine addictsâ to people whoâd say, âI donât have a home. Can I live in your house?â Crank callers had a field day. One candidate seemed promisingâuntil the Brismans discovered that the car sheâd claimed to own was actually a series of borrowed ones sheâd driven to their meetings, raising a red flag about the stability of her living situation. After expanding the scope of their advertisements to smaller publications with circulations outside the big metropolitan market, they finally found someone who inspired their confidence. Linda was a college-educated resident of a small town in Maine with three kids of her own, whoâd seen an ad in a local paper that had struck a chord. Though she had ânever had a burning desire to be a mother,â Linda now says, filling a phone line with frankness and warmth, she had conceived twins the first time she and her husband began trying. âI had a very dear friend who couldnât have kids, and I felt guilty that God gave me two. I actually agonized over giving her one of the twins, but of course I couldnât do that.â Pregnancy and labor turned out to be smooth sailing, both for the twins and the singleton she had nextâa 10-pound boy she delivered without pain medication. âIn the meantime I found another friend who couldnât have kids, and it just broke my heart,â she says. A couple years later, she stumbled across an unexpected salve. âLo and behold, there was an ad in the local free paper, and it said: Wanted, Mom to be Gestational Carrier.â She answered it and eventually decided to arrange a meeting. âBecause of where my heart was, it could have been any couple sitting there and I would have done it,â she says. In fact, she would go on to be a surrogate four more times. âAs long as I knew they were sincere, I would help anyone.â At the time, she was the office manager at an assisted living community. She and her husband also had a building in which they rented out several apartments. âThe first time I did it,â she maintains, âthe money wasnât the factor at all. It was just a nice benefit of it. I donât like being pregnant. I wasnât doing it for that. Truly, it was because of my passion, and the ache that my heart felt for my friend. âAnd I knew for a fact that I wouldnât want a baby back if it wasnât mine genetically,â she adds. âGod, no! I really didnât want any more kids. So I was the perfect candidate.â The pregnancy was bumpy. It began with the implantation of three embryos in Lindaâs uterusâover the initial objections of both Linda and Dan. âI was the one who overruled them,â Melissa says candidly, âbecause I was such a pain. [Linda] didnât want to carry triplets. And my husband was like, âWhat are you, bananas, having three babies at one time?ââ But implanting three embryos was fairly common at a time when the odds were less than 50 percent that any one of them would produce a viable pregnancy. âAnd my physician was telling me that we were on the five-year planâdonât expect it to work the first time.â As it turned out, two of them took right off the bat. The Brismans started making visits to Maine. âDan and Melissa were involved with [my] kids,â Linda recalls. âThey even came up, it was during the Beanie Baby crazeâwhen they were metered out, or however they were rationedâand Dan and Melissa came and got in line with me so I could get Beanie Babies for the kids. It was so funny. They came up and brought them Christmas gifts. Thatâs something that I think is common. Itâs not about the gifts. They were part of the family for those nine months.â Yet by both womenâs accounts, Melissaâs anxiety introduced a lot of friction into the relationship. To overcome the distance between them, they scheduled weekly phone conversationsâon Thursday nights, right after Seinfeld (which they all watched) gave way to Veronicaâs Closet, (which they all hated). But their shared verdict on NBCâs âMust See TVâ lineup wasnât enough to bridge every divide. âI was so nervous about the pregnancy,â Melissa recalls, quickly bringing an example to mind. âShe used to be a big coffee drinker. And she used to always drink those really large Dunkinâ Donut coffees. And that used to drive me insane. I donât know why it drove me insane. But it drove me insane. And the doctor would have to tell me, âMelissa, you need to calm down. Itâs a cup of coffee. Sheâs six feet tall. The babies are doing fine. Sheâs a really good person. You need to leave her alone.ââ âI was pregnant, so of course I had the hormones raging also,â Linda remembers. âAnd it got so bad that when she called, I didnât want to talk to her â¦ Dan and I actually bonded more than Melissa and I didâduring the pregnancy, anyway. âI went through this with all my couples, really, on different levels,â she adds. âWhen you cannot be in control of something that is so criticalâsomething that is so near and dear to you, and you have zero control over itâthatâs a terrible feeling. And itâs a hopeless, helpless feeling, and thatâs how she dealt with it.â For Brisman, it was a dynamic that would rear up constantly in the years ahead, after she quit tax law to build a career around surrogacy. Because of the cost, which can surpass $100,000âsince medical expenses can easily outstrip the $25,000-$30,000 typically paid to carriersâit is by and large a service available only to a very affluent minority. âThe more educated and well-off that you are, the more youâre in control of your life,â Brisman remarks. âBut youâre not in control of your surrogate. Sheâs a person. And that loss of control is horrible. The more educated you are, the worse that it is, because the more you [usually] have the ability to control things. And you cannot control a pregnancy. âIt kind of prepares you for kids,â she adds after a pause, breaking into a classic parental laugh. âBecause you cannot control your child.â Andrew and Benjamin Brisman were born in a Maine hospital before a throng of medical residents whoâd crowded into the room to witness the hospitalâs first delivery by a gestational surrogate. âOh yeah, I had so many people watching my drug-free, vaginal delivery,â Linda cracksâriffing on a bit that sheâs incorporated into a late-blooming career in standup comedy (and adding that declining drugs was entirely her choice). âIt was quite amazing.â Melissa cut Andrewâs umbilical cord. Benjamin, who came out breech and lost oxygen momentarily (to no lasting detriment), was handled by the medical team. Then Melissa did something that Linda remembers more vividly than anything from the previous nine months. âShe bent down and kissed my forehead. And everything that happened during that pregnancy was nothing, compared to that moment. It was all about that moment. Everything else was just hormones and fearsâit wasnât who we were as people or why we did what we did â¦ It was all about that delivery. And truly, she bent down and kissed my forehead. And then Melissa stayed in my room with me, and I helped them with the twins. They had never diapered a baby before, so I showed them how to do that. She stayed in the room with me, and everything was just fine.â The Brisman familyâs return home a few days later left Linda with an unexpected feeling. âAfter the birth, you feel lost,â she reflects. âBecause youâve been such an important part of these peopleâs lives, for nine monthsâlonger, because of the planning and the transfer. And all this time, youâre so important to them, and they treat you like youâre so important. And after the pregnancy you kind of mourn the loss of that relationship.â Her voice wavers a little on the phone. âSo, sitting thereâIâm going to cryâthat first Thursday night after Iâd given birth, Dan called me,â she remembers. âHe didnât keep doing it. But I canât even begin to tell you how much that meant to me. It justâoh my God, I love them so much. Theyâre just really good people. Not all couples are good. But they were.â Â  What the Brismans and their paid gestational carrier did was legal in the state of Maine. Or, to put it a slightly different way, it wasnât illegal. As of 2015, there are no statutes in Maine law that expressly permit or prohibit commercial surrogacy. Maine is nevertheless considered a relatively permissive state, by dint of favorable court rulings. For instance, in 2012 the Supreme Court of Maine overturned a district courtâs refusal to declare Robert and Celia Nolan the legal parents of a child, created by his sperm and her egg, born to another woman who had carried it according to a contract to which all parties had agreed. (In that case, the carrier and her husband had joined the Nolans in their legal complaint; they did not want to be listed as the legal parents of what they considered the Nolansâ child.) Other states treat surrogacy differently. Nevada explicitly permits compensation to be paid to gestational carriers, provided that the child is genetically unrelated to the carrier. In the District of Columbia, surrogacy contracts of all kinds are void, and punishable with a fine of up to $10,000 and a year in jail. New Jersey and New Yorkâwhose border lies less than a mile to the northeast of Brismanâs agency, Reproductive Possibilitiesâban commercial surrogacy. Most state codes do not address surrogacy at all, partly because discussions about pregnancy have a way of leading to discussions about abortion, which are toxic for the average American legislator. That leaves case law to serve as an imperfect guide. New Jerseyâs prohibition of surrogacy dates to the sensational Baby M case. In 1984, a woman named Mary Beth Whitehead entered into a surrogacy contract with William and Becky Stern. It stipulated that Whitehead would carry a baby created by Williamâs sperm and one of her own eggs, and would then relinquish her parental rights to the Sterns. Less than one day after transferring custody of the newborn, Whitehead decided that she wanted the baby back. The case made its way to the Supreme Court of New Jersey, whose 1988 decision invalidated surrogacy contracts as being contrary to public policy. (The Court remanded the specific matter of Baby M to a family court to determine custody according to the âbest interest of the childâ; the lower court awarded custody to the Sterns and visitation rights to Whitehead.) Although the Baby M case was emblematic of the main concern around traditional surrogacy, the rise of gestational surrogacy has flipped the dynamic. Custody disputes in gestational surrogacy mostly arise when intentional parents (as the commissioning parties are typically called) try to back out of an agreement. Earlier this year, former View co-host Sherri Shepherd attempted to evade legal custody for a child whose birth to a surrogate, using an egg from an anonymous donor, she had arranged with her then-husband John Sally. Shepherd and Sally filed for divorce during the pregnancy. In April a Pennsylvania judge declared her to be the legal mother of the 8-month-old, and liable for child support. Anything can happen during a pregnancyâs nine months to complicate surrogacy arrangements, from an apparent change of heart like Shepherdâs to the death of one of the involved parties. Uncertainty is a feature of all sorts of long-term contracts, but the intimate nature of procreation and family law makes surrogacy contracts particularly challenging from a public-policy perspective. Many states are effectively legal vacuums when it comes to surrogacy. Intentional parents must request a legal order for their names to be placed on a childâs birth certificate, instead of the carrierâs name. Depending on conditions like marital status and sexual orientation, the odds that these petitions will be granted can vary from county to countyâeither on account of particular judges, or the proclivities of bureaucratic agencies responsible for registering births. The denial of a legal birth order can put intentional parents in the strange position of having to adopt their genetic childâa process that frequently takes months and requires them to submit to criminal background checks, FBI clearance, and in-home supervision by a social worker. Meanwhile the carrier is at risk of being legally responsible for the child. Shortly after the birth of her twins, Brisman abandoned tax law to build a legal practice focusing on surrogacy. She cold-called fertility doctors, offering to give them seminars on the legal aspects of gestational surrogacy that doubled as advertisements for her burgeoning agency. âI was one of the first lawyers to join the American Society of Reproductive Medicine,â Brisman says. âEvery year I would petition them to get me to give a lecture. And in the beginning no one showed up to my lectures. But now, like, 500 people might show up.â âShe was a pioneer,â Merle Berger says, âin setting up, as an attorney, organizations which would both search out and find surrogates and do the legal work. There werenât many choices. In fact, there still arenât.â In 2001, the first year she went out on her own, she took a case filed by a married couple who sought a âpre-birth orderââa request, in advance of the birth of their genetic child to a surrogate carrier, for their names to be placed on the birth certificate. Their request was opposed by the state Department of Public Health. The case went to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Brisman was 28 years old. âIt was funny,â she remembers, âbecause I had my backpack from law school still. It was burgundy. I still remember. And I was wearing my sneakers, and I was the youngest person there because there were all these, like, 50-year-old men.â She won the case, and then successfully argued before courts in other states to win parentage orders either before birth or on the same day. In Maine, where she wasnât licensed to practice, she was permitted to act in a pro hac vice capacity to do birth orders for her own twins. âThen I did it in Pennsylvania, and then I did it in New York, and then in New Jersey.â The New Jersey action involved two cases. In one, a woman was carrying a child created by an egg belonging to her cancer-stricken sister, which had been frozen prior to a bone-marrow transplant and cancer treatment, and implanted after her sister had been cancer-free for five years. In the other, a woman was carrying the genetic child of her brother and his wife. The idea that the childâs birth certificate would list the blood siblings as parents was ârepulsiveâ to the altruistic carrier, recalls Brisman, who overcame resistance from the attorney general to obtain a pre-birth order that would become effective 72 hours after the birth, in keeping with a mandatory waiting period the state imposes before custody of any child can be transferred from its birth mother. (Waiting periods are a common feature of adoption law, which, along with sperm and egg donation, is a part of Brismanâs practice.) Brisman has also successfully advocated on behalf of gay parents seeking to grow their families through surrogacy. In 2005 she filed an action in Pennsylvania seeking a declaration of legal paternity for two men, so that they would be recognized as the legal parents of a child upon its birth to a surrogate. In 2008, she helped two New York women gain a legal declaration of maternity in a similar case. More recently, she has helped draft a bill for the New Jersey legislature that would recognize gestational surrogacy contracts and regulate some of their provisions (such as guaranteeing a carrierâs access to independent counsel, and requiring both parties to pass a psychological evaluation). It has been passed twice by the legislature, but vetoed by Governor Chris Christie each time, including this June, the day before he officially announced his campaign for the presidency. Â  Though New Jersey and New York prohibit their citizens from receiving financial compensation for pregnancy, residents can legally enter surrogacy contracts with carriers residing in more permissive states. So finding carriers is the most important piece of Brismanâs business. She targets âworking to middle-classâ women whose husbands or partners are the primary breadwinners. âWe donât want to see that all their income is coming from support or welfare,â Brisman says. âThey have to be stable and be able to feed themselves.â Surrogacy, she adds, âcould be about the moneyâ for these women, âbut it canât be 100 percent about the money.â When she started out, Brisman would use advertising clearinghouses to target regional publications toward the end of their publication schedules, when their ad rates dropped. âYou could buy every Penny-Saver in all of New England,â she explains. Sheâd take out ads in whichever ones had unsold space going for about half-price. She would also buy space on paper placemats in small-town diners. She showed me a recent one from Flapjackâs Restaurant and Pub in Dillsburg, Pennsylvania. âYou might pay a few hundred dollars [for this ad], and no one calls all year. But next year we might get two people. So these things we still try.â Increasingly, the search for surrogates has moved to the internet. So if you Google âgestational surrogacy Rhode Island,â for example, an ad for Brismanâs firm pops up on the first page of search results. Another way you might find out about Reproductive Possibilities is on the back of a cash-register receipt from a place like Walmart or Dollar General. âThatâs really expensive, like thousands per month,â Brisman says. âThe cost of my advertising is insane.â But itâs effective. âNormally, on a Monday, we get, like, 60 applications to be a surrogate,â she says. The firm looks for women between 21 and 40 years old whoâve already had childrenâwhich is partially an ethical precaution, to ensure that any risk a surrogate pregnancy might pose to a carrierâs ability to bear future children will not deprive her of having any offspring whatsoever. There are other basic criteria. Surrogates must have body-mass indexes within a certain range, and canât be taking mental-health medications. They have to pass driving, credit, and criminal-background checks. The firm inspects Facebook profilesââa royal pain in the ass,â Brisman says, that can raise important red flags. Theyâve discovered applicants who have had their children taken away by state childrenâs-welfare agencies. Or âsomebody who says they had no tattoos, and thereâs, like, five of them on their arm in their Facebook picture.â The firm doesnât actually care about tattoos, she explains, âbut you canât have a tattoo within six months of an embryo transfer unless you have documentation from the tattoo parlor that it was hepatitis-free.â After that screening comes a series of three interviews. âThen we send someone to their home to, like, look in their refrigerator, test their water, interview the family, make sure that they have a safe place to live,â Brisman says. âSo, out of those initial 60 applicants, we might get two.â If thereâs a typical profile, itâs âsomeone who married their high-school sweetheart. They make $50,000 combined. They have three kids. This is a good way for them to make some extra money. Pregnancy is easy for them. And they are just all excited to be on a plane. âOr sometimes theyâre petrified,â Brisman adds. âWe did once have a carrier who was so scared to go on a plane, we had to walk her through it. Sheâd delivered three babies, but getting on a planeâ¦ The clinic was in California, so we had to buy her tickets to a Beverly Hills rich-and-famous tour to convince her to get on the plane, she was so scared.â I spoke with four carriers. One used the money to pay off student loans from nursing school. Another was able to move her family to a better home in another state. âIt helped my family tremendously,â she told me. âI donât know when I would have been able to come up with a chunk of money to use on a down payment for a house.â Linda, who carried Brismanâs twins, maintains that altruism remained an important motive in her subsequent surrogate pregnancies, but adds that she became savvier about negotiating the contractual terms with each one. âDefinitely, the money was a piece of it,â she says. âAfter you get a taste of getting that money, it becomes a piece of it.â Carrying the Brismanâs twins allowed her to remodel some of her home. âI would tease Dan and Melissaâwhen they came to visit, Iâd say, âThis is the Dan and Melissa family room.â We joked about it.â Yet the last of her five surrogate pregnancies, which happened to be the only one arranged by an agency other than Brismanâs, culminated in âthe worst thing Iâve ever endured in my life.â She miscarried at 22 weeks. The loss of the child, a devastating blow, was compounded by the intended parentsâ refusal to cover $300 of lost wages due to the miscarriageâdespite the fact that their contract stipulated an allowance for up to $3,000. âThey turned their back on me, saying I was being selfish,â she remembers, with pain that still seems fresh. âSo I also had to grieve the loss of the parents, and I had never experienced that before.â Barb, who carried Simmie, is a devout churchgoer who had initially tried to decline payment. She relented in the face of Melissaâs insistence. After spending some of it on a family trip to Disneyland, she says she gave a lot of the money away. âIâm not money-driven, and I didnât want it,â she remarks. âOr I shouldnât say I didnât want itâbut I felt that that was taking away from the gift of helping other people. So we donated to the church, we sponsored kids at camp, that kind of stuff.â The intentional parents on the other end of surrogacy transactions are a diverse group. They are women born with uterine abnormalities, survivors of cancer treatments that have impaired their ability to reproduce, and women who have endured miscarriage after miscarriage. Some are high-powered professionals who have put off procreation until an age, when, for many, it is too late. In recent years, the rise of gay-marriage equality has dramatically expanded the number of gay men who turn to gestational surrogacy to have children. Foreign nationals are another growing segment of the marketplace. The United States (depending on the state) is one of a very small handful of countries where commercial surrogacy is permitted. Many countries prohibit altruistic surrogacy as well. Laws vary. In Israel, a state-appointed committee reviews contracts on a case-by-case basisâbut has heretofore declined to approve any arrangement involving homosexual or inter-religious couples. Gay Israelis have been a substantial part of Brismanâs client mix. Chinese nationals form another significant segment; using an American gestational surrogate enables them to select the sex of a child, and to endow that child with US citizenship, by dint of his or her (usually his) birth on American soil. The unifying characteristic of all these people is wealth. Even in cases when Brisman provides her services free of charge (either through charity organizations like the Gay Parenting Assistance Program, or for people whose hardship has pulled her heartstrings), medical costs and the carrierâs compensation make gestational surrogacy available to a small, very affluent minority. And therein lies one of the trickiest aspects of the surrogacy business. The economic and social gulf separating intentional parents from the surrogates bearing their children is so wide, it effectively defines entirely different worlds. With nearly every arrangement she makes, Brisman has to bridge that divideâa challenge that casts contemporary inequality in a fascinating light. When Brisman mentioned testing the water in the homes of prospective carriers, I couldnât help wonder why. American tap water is abundantly regulated and hasnât been a serious public health issue in decadesâthough natural-gas fracking has made it a concern in some areas, including parts of Pennsylvania where some of Brismanâs carriers live. âAre people drinking unsafe water?â I ask. âNo, but itâs an obsession of our clients,â she replies. Some clients arrange to have bottled water shipped to their carrierâs homes during the duration of the pregnancy. Others fixate on their carrierâs diet. Or her cookware. âSo they do things like, they want organic food, so they ship it,â Brisman says. âWe had a client who shipped food, got her a chef in the house, and got her all new pots because she didnât like the idea that she had pots that were Teflon.â She recalls one couple who insisted on restricting their carrier from taking her kids to archery practice, and another that insisted on flying their carrier to doctor appointments in a private jetâdespite how unnerving it was for her to be the only person aboard a flight whose cost she could barely stand to think about. âWe once had a client who wanted the carrier to have organic makeup, which I had never heard of,â Brisman goes on. âHealth and beauty products that were completely, like, free of chemicals. So she offered to get her an account at some fancy department store where she could buy all her health and beauty products. âAnd I was pretty afraid, actually, to call her up and ask her.â Maligning a womanâs makeup is, to put it mildly, a delicate business. âBut the carrier loved it. She was so happy â¦ buying all kinds of fancy shampoos.â âSome of the carriers wonât have it,â Brisman says. âThey will say, âNo, Iâm not doing that, get somebody else. This is crazy.ââ In practice, it often falls to a carrier to decide whom sheâs willing to carry a baby for. A surrogate unwilling to abort a fetus with a congenital anomaly, for example, would obviously be a bad match for intended parents who want to keep the option of abortion open. (Conversely, a surrogateâs right to terminate a pregnancy is constitutionally protected, though a carrier who chose to could expect a tussle over her financial compensation, which is paid out over the course of the pregnancy.) Sometimes surrogates simply get a bad feeling about how committed a couple is to a potential child, or how committed they are to one another. A surrogate might also refuse to carry a baby for a gay couple, or a Jewish one, or a couple she deems too old to parent new children. The 50 or so fertility clinics Brisman works with have their own requirements for intended parents, which may include psychological evaluations and age cutoffs. But as long as clinics donât turn up any red flags, Brisman mostly tries to reserve judgment. âWhen I started doing this, the only people that I helped were 100 percent in need of a carrierâtheyâd lost their uterus, had cancer, had six miscarriages. Now sometimes it blurs the line,â she says. âFifteen years ago, you were gay, or a heterosexual and couldnât carry the baby. You werenât 42 years old and didnât want to carry the baby, which I find to be much harder of a call. Sometimes itâs hard to keep your personal view out of it. We might have somebody who has perfectly healthy twins, but only wants one baby, and they might reduce. And I have to reserve judgment. So thatâs hard â¦ I have twins, you know. So sometimes itâs been hard to see things that I donât think, personally, should be done. But as a lawyer, you canât judge people. And Iâve had to really come to terms with being able to see all the sides.â The intended parents and carriers I spoke with mostly described positive relationships. But any number of things can sour the rapport. âI had a carrier who covered her face in the delivery because she didnât want to see the intended parents,â Brisman recalls. âShe was just so pissed at them.â Brisman credits one of her employees with helping intended parents and carriers see more eye-to-eye. But her own upbringing has undoubtedly played an important role too. âI think it would be harder if I didnât have all sorts of people in my neighborhood, growing up,â she says. âPeople who are well-off and well-educated often come from people who are well-off and well-educated. And a lot of times, they just donât know how to treat somebody else who isnât. And itâs not necessarily vindictive or conceited. Itâs just the inability to relate to somebody who grew up differently, because they havenât been around it. âThere are other intended parents who feel like itâs almost a right,â she continues. âLike theyâre paying this woman $25,000, so she has to do whatever they say. And they donât recognize that itâs not that much money, and [what sheâs doing is] a huge gift, and you have to treat her like a person. âMore than a lawyer, sometimes Iâm a personality coach,â she concludes. âLike, you have to treat people like you would want to be treated. You would think that you wouldnât have to tell somebody that, but you really do.â By the time the Brismans embarked on their own second surrogate pregnancy, Melissa had internalized at least some of the advice she gives her clients. âBarb knew that I was a nervous person,â she recalls. âAnd so she would email or text me every morning: âIâm awake, Iâm alive, Iâm fine.â Barb characterizes their relationship as sisterly, despite a pregnancy marked by a worrisome buildup of excess amniotic fluid. She also has a vivid memory from immediately after her delivery, as Simmie was being evaluated and cleaned by the obstetric team. âDan went over to Simmie, and Melissa was still by my side,â she recalls. âAnd I said, âMelissa, go to your baby!â And she said, âI donât want to leave you alone.â âHereâs this person who canât have kids, who went to this expense to have kids,â Barb marvels. âAnd I think that goes to show the bond that we had. I think it speaks volumes of the relationship you can have, if both parties want it. âItâs one of those things Iâll never forget, because it was one of the most defining acts of kindness that Iâve experienced.â Â  Carrying a child for a woman who canât carry her own is a profoundly humane act. It is also a deeply controversial one. Periodically Brisman debates bioethicist Art Caplan, the founding director of Pennâs Center For Bioethics (who departed in 2012 after 18 years), on TV. Caplan opposes commercial surrogacy on the grounds that it exploits women, whose âonly motive for being a paid surrogate is poverty,â as he wrote last year in The New York Times. Like many critics (and some proponents) of surrogacy, he is especially wary of âreproductive tourismâ in developing nations like India, where surrogates come cheap and exploitation has been documented. âHe makes the case that we shouldnât be able to sell a part of our body,â says Brisman, who has limited her business to American carriers. âBut in my mind, you do that in almost every laboring profession, right? So he says thereâs a risk youâre going to die giving birth. Well, should we not have people work in coalmines? More people die in coalmines, digging coal, than they do giving birth. Should we tell people they canât play football for a profit, because they might get a head injury? Somehow, when you get a woman involved, all of a sudden they canât consent. But men can consent to all these dangerous activities. âI think the real problem is that there needs to be education,â Brisman continues. âWhen a surrogate comes to me, I educate her:  You could die giving birth; this many people die giving birth. You know, weâre going to get you life insurance. You could have a stroke. This is why we donât want you to carry triplets, because it is dangerous. And even though most of the danger is to the babies, the danger is to you, too.  So a lot of it is in the education. When you donât regulate it, thatâs a big problem.â Some legal scholars have leveled a different objection to commercial surrogacy: that the parental privacy rights pertaining to a child in a womanâs womb are inalienable. In the wake of the Baby M case, Anita Allen, the Henry R. Silverman Professor of Law and a current member of the Presidential Bioethics Commission, argued that âfreedom of contract should not include the freedom to bargain away certain constitutional rights,â and that âconstitutional privacy prohibits the validation and enforcement of irrevocable surrogacy agreements.â â[C]hildless men and couples do not have privacy rights that entitle them to state enforcement of surrogacy agreements,â she concluded, whereas âwould-be surrogate mothers have constitutional privacy rights so strong as to limit their own capacities for alienating their procreative and traditional parental prerogatives.â Yet the rise of gestational surrogacy has at the very least complicated that line of reasoning. Couples who use their own gametes to create an embryo can be seen to have some parental privacy rights inherent in it, even if the embryo is nurtured in another womanâs womb. It also bears noting that all of the carriers with whom I spoke emphasized a certain feeling of disconnection from the fetuses they carried, arising from the knowledge that they were genetically unrelated. âItâs like if you babysit someoneâs child,â Barb remarks. âYou donât think of keeping it. I knew, going into it, this was their baby, 100 percent biologically. So I went into it with a different state of mind.â But even that notionâthat a genetic relationship outweighs the biological connection forged through the wombâis heavily influenced by culture. Indeed, the Brismans discovered as much for themselves when they went to arrange a bris for their twins. âThe rabbi was so excited by how we had the kids,â Dan recalls. âHe thought it was such a wonderful, great thing, and it was why he was going to call his elders, his people in Israel, to discuss it. âSo he calls us back, and he tells us he spoke to his elders, and this is wonderful. Weâre going to have the bris, and weâll also be doing the conversion. I said, âWhat are you talking about, the conversion?â Well, in his mindâand in the eldersâ minds, I guessâthe boys, since they were born from someone that was not Jewish, had to be converted.â âThe oven was unkosher,â Melissa chimes in. âThatâs what he told us.â They found another rabbi. But thereâs clearly more than one way to evaluate the relative importance of nature and nurture when it comes to gestational surrogacy. And though there is no disputing the powerful role of genes, the intrauterine environmentâs influence on a childâs future health and well-being is also well-establishedâand may well be increasingly appreciated as the science of epigenetics advances. Its importance surely accounts for many of the anxieties intended parents have about their carriersâ diets and lifestyles. Whatever your view, gestational surrogacy has become a far more accepted practice over the past 15 years, and Brisman has played a big role in its expansion on the East Coast. âThis is a big business now,â she reflects. âBut when I did this, I didnât do this to make a big business. I mean, it grew, and Iâm happy about it. But I think in some sense if you do what you love, it will grow. And I loved helping other people do what I did.â Debates about what, if any, limits should be placed on it will probably continue to reflect the mores of a society that doesnât restrict ordinary parenthood at all. You may need a license to drive, as the old observation goes, but all it takes to create a child is the biological capacity to do so. In one sense, gestational surrogacy simply extends that weighty liberty to a wider circle. The universal hope is that that every newborn child will extend blessings further still. After she bore Simmie Brisman, Barb went on to carry once more, for a different couple. The memory that stuck with her in the wake of that surrogacy was of encountering the intended motherâs own mom. âShe came up to me and said, âI just want to thank you. You know, when Amy had her diagnosis as a teenager, I never thought Iâd be a grandmom.â And it was at that point that I thought, âMan, this isnât just about Melissa and Dan, or Amy and Matt. This is aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents.â And that just made me fall in love with the idea all the more. Itâs not just a nuclear unit. Itâs about the entire family.â a beautiful article about a beautiful woman. and the kudos bestowed on her and the benovelence she has bestowed is even 2 thousand times as great. Sincerely, Victor This is an great article about an even more amazing woman. She has so much passion for what she does and truly gets a joy out of helping couples that cannot conceive or carry their own baby for whatever reasons and helps their dreams come true.
Melissa embodies what a strong perseverant woman is. She would not take no for an answer and in turn became a very successful business woman as well as a great wife, mother and friend!! What a beautifully written article!  Itâs great to see someone so passionate about life (literally) and pursuing a career in something in which they believe so strongly.  Iâm sure there were more lucrative careers for a Wharton and Harvard Law School grad, but if more people followed their passions like Melissa, the world would be a better, and happier, place. Wonderful article about some very important issues.  Melissa Brisman is truly a pioneer in this field and has helped directly and indirectly thousands of people to conceive children who would not have been able to without using a gestational carrier.  Her intelligence, passion, creativity and experience have made this very high tech and complicated process a reality for so many and helped those of us in the field approach these pregnancies in a way that makes sense legally and logistically.  I have learned a tremendous amount from working with Melissa for the last decade and it has been a real privilege and always a learning experience.  Thanks so much to Melissa for sharing her own personal story and experiences and to Trey Popp for writing them all down!  Serena H Chen MD, IRMS at Saint Barnabas, Livingston, NJ http://www.sbivf.com What a great article!  Melissa has done so much to change the lives of so many and make their dreams come true.  Working in the industry has given me insight into what she has also done on a global scale.  She has influenced policy, driven the rights of all types of families forward and has educated individuals and couples worldwide, helping to remove the stigma of the gestational carrier experience.  Thank you for featuring Melissa in the Gazette. As a fellow attorney and colleague of Melissa, I can attest to the incredible joy her intended parents feel when they finally have the family theyâve so longed for.  Melissa brings unmatched expertise and enthusiasm to her clients and continues to push the envelope on broader reproductive rights issues.  This article illuminates the personal side of her and Danâs struggles and artfully weaves the personal and professional story together. What a wonderful article about a very deserving woman and a good friend. You have accomplished so much! I am so proud for you, Melissa!  Keep up the wonderful work you are doing; I am sure many, many families are very thankful! Youâre an amazing lady Melissa!!! Inspiring.

[Photo Credit: SockPuppetBC] Her brain is filled with more knowledge than youâre capable of consuming. 

 
[Photo Credit: Giphy]Hunter earned her degree in Modern Languages atÂ Oxford University, where she concentrated on French and Italian. From there, she moved to Paris to study avante-garde theater at LâÃcole Internationale de ThÃ©Ã¢tre Jacques Lecoq, before moving to New York to train at the Saratoga International Theatre Institute.

Apparenty, the "BBHMM" songstress completely adores her ex-boyfriend's little girl. But the 26-year-old hip-hop superstar must now deal with nonstop drama involving baby mama Nia Guzman, and such frustration is driving him to tears. Will this ultimately ruin his rekindled friendship with the 27-year-old Barbadian beauty?  Like Us on Facebook   Apparently, Guzman rarely lets Brown visit Royalty anymore since the former flings are currently going through the process of a vicious custody battle. Still, the "Loyal" crooner tries to talk to his firstborn whenever possible, usually by phone. But when he finally got connected via FaceTime on Tuesday (August 18), Guzman was not too pleased: "Right off the bat, Nia was upset," an alleged insider tells the popular gossip webloid HollywoodLife.com. After 40 minutes of struggle, supposedly Guzman just put Royalty down for a nap when Breezy called. The sound woke her up, and Guzman was extremely peeved: "Nia told Chris 'This is not a good time, dude. You just woke her up and she's crying,'" the snitch reveals. Brown was very understanding and said, "I'm sorry. How was I supposed to know that? But since she's up, give her the phone. I want to sing this rhyme I made for her. It will put her back to sleep." Sweet, right? But Guzman wouldn't allow it. Before hanging-up she explained that both mommy and baby were too exhausted and needed to sleep - pronto. The "Ayo" singer tried calling back later, but was immediately sent to voicemail. Now he's totally heartbroken, and can't help missing the only important female currently in his life. Hopefully Guzman will change her mind, seeing how miserable this entire situation makes Brown: "He was hurt," the source concludes. "He cried. It was just painful for him to hear Royalty crying and knowing he couldn't do anything to calm her down... He really wishes Nia could see how much she's ripping his heart out by withholding his FaceTime sessions with Royalty." Will Breezy eventually lean on Rih for support again? Meanwhile, Brown must continue focusing on his upcoming "One Hell of a Nite" tour. RELATED: Rihanna Stressed, Chris Brown Boyfriend Drama Prompts Album Delay?

(Twitter) Liza Morales is the longtime ex-girlfriend of Lamar Odom and mother to his children. Read on for the facts on Morales and her kids with Odom below. Have a look at the best Instagram photos of Lamar Odom's children. His kids are Destiny and Lamar Jr., along with his baby Jayden who died of SIDS. In an open letter, Morales talked about when she first met and started dating Odom. Morales wrote:  I met Lamar in the 9th grade in Queens, New York, and was completely taken in by his wit, charm, and that devastating smile he so easily flashed at anyone he met. We dated from the 11th grade on and shared a tight bond due to a lot of things, including the fact that we both were products of broken homes. Joe Odom is the father of Lamar. Read on for the sad details on Lamar's dad, his late mother, and his family.  My family. â¤ @itskhloeodom @itslamodom @LJODOM A photo posted by Destiny Odom (@destiinyodom) on Mar 5, 2013 at 1:39pm PST Morales and Odom have a daughter named Destiny and a son named Lamar Odom Jr., after his dad. Keeping Up With the Kardashians fans have seen Odomâs children on his spin-off show Khloe & Lamar. In addition, they have walked the red carpet with their father and ex-step-mother Khloe Kardashian. Their children live with Morales in New York City. Odom and Morales had another child together, who died from SIDS as a baby in 2006. His name was Jayden. Morales opened up about the death to The Daily Beast, saying:  Lamar and I never really talked about our loss, which I know wasnât healthy and also meant our relationship would never last. It couldnât. I found out soon after that heâd had a long-term relationship with another womanâa relationship he said heâd end but he didnâtâand that was that. Destiny Odom is the daughter of Lamar Odom and Liza Morales. Have a look at her best Instagram photos. Morales has been a star on the show Starter Wives, which aired on the TLC network and then moved to just be shown on the TLC website. Exes of Rappers 50 Cent, DMX and fighter Floyd Mayweather all appeared on the show. Morales told The Daily Beast about why she decided to do the show, explaining:  Though some frown upon my decision to do a reality show, I agreed to be a part of âStarter Wivesâ so I could tell my own story of how things unfolded after Lamar married Khloe. We werenât really together so I didnât fall apart as many have suggested. Iâve have to deal with a lot of tabloid lies as the result of all the attention Lamar gets since heâs married to someone so famous. She continued: To be honest Iâm really doing the show for my daughter to prove to her that you can get up and move on after things fall apart. I did it to show her how you make mistakes and fix them and that you can never give up on yourself. She needed to see that and hear it from me. I think I also hope my father sees it as well. The only time Iâve seen my dad in recent years was at the funeral for my son. Morales said that Lamar Odom wasnât very happy about her doing the show. Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom's relationship has been on display for years. Their divorce, the cheating allegations, the drugs, and more have plagued them.  Obsessed with this photo @itskhloeodom A photo posted by Destiny Odom (@destiinyodom) on Feb 10, 2013 at 2:29pm PST Morales posted an open letter online when she talked about Lamarâs telling her he was getting married. Morales wrote:  I donât think Iâll forget the tight knot I felt in the pit of my stomach the morning I received the text message with three simple words on the screen. It read âIâm getting marriedâ and it was from the man Iâd spent more than 10 years of my life with. Years that included us getting engaged in 2000 and becoming parents to one daughter and two sons. Yet not long after our separation Lamar Odom was getting married to Khloe Kardashian, a woman heâd met four weeks before. How could the man whoâd constantly given me reason after reason for why we couldnât get married just yet now be ready to tie the knot so quickly? There arenât words to explain how I felt that day. Check out all the latest news on Khloe Kardashian, plus her best Instagram photos since her weight loss in 2015.

Morales told The Daily Beast:  His small mind and small thinking ended the relationship with my dad. I wanted a life with Lamar and needed my family to support that.

 Well, this is one way to get a message to your ex-wife. During the third quarter of the Super Bowl, actor Taye Diggs made it clear what he was watching: ex-wife Idina Menzel's national anthem performance. See moreÂ Super Bowl 2015: Watch the Commercials Alongside the message, the accompanying photo of his TV screen also appeared to show the former couple's son, Walter, watching mom's big moment. Seems like Diggs is really taking that "let it go" mantra to heart. Yup. Baby mama crushed it at the Super Bowl. pic.twitter.com/94Vs8trhuD Menzel wasn't the only Super Bowl performer to get an online shout-out from an ex. Earlier on Sunday, halftime headliner Katy Perry also got some good vibesÂ sent her way from her ex-husband Russell Brand. A version of this post originally appeared on Billboard.com.

But one person was more overwhelmed than most: baby mama Nia Ameyâs ex-husband, who RadarOnline.com has learned divorced Brownâs baby mama after he found out about the affair! âIt ainât going to take a rocket science to figure that out. I got a divorce because Nia got pregnant by someone else,â Terry Amey told Radar. Divorce documents obtained by Radar reveal that the Ameys married in January 2003, and âceased to live together as husband and wife on or about January 2014.â The divorce documents claimed that Nia was âpregnant at the time of filingâ but Terry denied paternity and requested a DNA test. She gave birth to her child by Brown that summer. READ THE DIVORCE DOCUMENTS âIt might be a shock to the world being that Chris Brown is a father and now heâs going to have to step up to do right thing,â Terry told Radar. âBut at the same time Iâm a god-loving person and I have to forgive to give my message.â And the message he wants to make clear is that his ex is not who the world thinks. âShe was young and she had obstacles and made mistakes and now you have a child involved,â he said. âSocial media is making it worse than what it is. But nobody is perfect,â he continued. âWhen youâre in this industry all types of things are going to happen. Itâs not just happening with my ex wife â itâs all women in the industry. When you allow persuasion and [being] misled to guide you, things are going to happen. It is what it is. Itâs a part of growing. PHOTOS: Sowing Their Celebrity Oats! 15 Famous Dads Who Have Plenty Of Kidsâ¦ And Baby Mamas! âSocial media is saying this and that and that sheâs a gold digger. â¦ Nia is not the person who they portray. She has a past, but who donât have one [sic]. She knew whose that baby was, so that name âRoyaltyâ came [about] because she will be royalty.â Terry and Nia also have a 13-year-old daughter, Zillah, who he wants to keep out of the headlines. âIâm upset social media is blowing this up and two kids are involved and theyâre young,â said Terry. But meanwhile, Nia is âa great mother,â he insisted. âSheâs been raising Zillah and Royaltyâ with the help of her own mother. PHOTOS: Baby Mama Drama! The 14 Wildest Celebrity Mothers But Terry wants the girlsâ dads to have a role too, and so heâs asking Brown to consent to a man-to-man talk. âWe are going to have a sit-down. Terry Amey and Chris Brown are going to have a sit-down because weâre sharing daughters,â he said. âI never met the man before â the only thing is what I see on TV. I might not be nothing to him because Iâm not in music, but I am somebody. We are going to have a talk.â âIâm not worried about Chrisâ past,â he continued. âIâm worried about his future. Thatâs Zillahâs sister. We need to raise these girls. We will have a time because we share something thatâs valuable to us â our little girls.â âAnd the end of the day there are two parents involved â him, me and the baby mama â and somewhere along the line we going to have a sit-down and an understanding,â he insisted. PHOTOS: Meet The Parents! Hollywoodâs Best & Worst Moms And Dads Terry says that despite the media publicity surrounding the birth, and celebrity connection, he still has a good relationship with his ex-wife. And he hopes to amicably co-parent with Chris, even though he says the R&B starâs fling with his wife broke up his marriage. âMy life does goes on. The baby being here and a baby taking nine months, I knew about the child. I did visit with the baby,â said Terry. âI thought I could have been the baby daddy. â¦â he added. But now that the truth is out, he said, âIâm not going to let this Chris Brown thing discourage me. Iâm on their team, even up until today. Sheâs driving my car to take Chrisâs baby around places and to the doctor. Iâm still here.â  6 things to know about Louis Tomlinsonâs babyÂ mama Sign Up / Sign In Sign In // Sign Up Sign Up / Sign In Sign In // Sign Up Sign Up / Sign In Sign In // Sign Up Almost Done!

 July 15, 2015 | 2:21pm Meet Briana Jungwirth, the woman expecting a baby with @OneDirection's @Louis_Tomlinson http://t.co/h5KKsPMDSg pic.twitter.com/qRgCX5CDgR â People magazine (@people) July 14, 2015  There is something bigger than One Direction these days: Louis Tomlinsonâs baby bombshell. As People reports, the 23-year-old boybander is expecting his first child with gal pal Briana Jungwirth. AÂ close friend of the pair claims they are âvery excitedâ to welcome the new arrival. While Tomlinson is one of the most highly publicized singers in the world, Jungwirth is relatively unknown â until now, that is. Before we meet the duoâs bundle of joy, letâs get acquainted with Mom first. 1 The 23-year-old currently works as a stylist in Los Angeles, where she assists on fashion shoots. Though she doesnât boast Rachel Zoeâs Rolodex, Jungwirth was rumored to be employed by, you guessed it, One Direction. 2 Unlike Tomlinsonâs ex-girlfriend, Eleanor Calder, Jungwirth was born and raised in the US of A. Still no word where the two will raise their tot. 3 Though Tomlinson is a certified serial tweeter, Jungwirth certainly is not. In fact, the mom-to-be doesnât have public Twitter, Facebook or Instagram accounts. 4 After splitting with Calder in March, it didnât take long for Tomlinson to re-emerge with a new lady on his arm. The One Directioner met Jungwirth through mutual friends in May, before taking her out on several dates in LA. 5 Tomlinson and Jungwirth will forever be linked once their child is born, but that doesnât mean the singer will be popping the question anytime soon. As a pal tells People, âHe and Briana are very, very close friends and this [the pregnancy] has brought them even closer.â 6 Jungwirth has a reputation for beingÂ âvery private,âÂ so chances are sheâll spend the next nine months quietly.

												 Chris Brown can finally focus on raising his 1-year-old daughter, Royalty. On Monday, Brown, 26, and the mother of his daughter, Nia Guzman, reached joint legal and physical custody agreements, according to TMZ. âCourt went great today,â Brown tweeted of the news. âGlad this all worked out.â As per their new agreement, Royaltyâs last name will officially be Brown. The R&B singer will get 12 days a month withÂ his daughterÂ without supervision. And for the finances, Brown will dole out $2,500 every month to Guzman. He will also be financially responsible for the kidâs education expenses, insurance, medical bills and childcare. Brown also took a drug test during the custody battle. He turned up positive for marijuana and codeine â both of which he has prescriptions for.  The QUEEN!ð A photo posted by @chrisbrownofficial on Aug 23, 2015 at 11:10pm PDT

 Lamar Odomâs Baby Mama Liza Morales Sends Inspiring Tweet After HisÂ Hospitalization Latest Fashion News: Latest Fashion Photos: Latest Beauty News: Latest Beauty Photos: Lamar Odomâs ex, longtime girlfriend Liza Morales, is too struggling with the devastating news about her former love. While Lamar remains in the hospital, Liza is sending her love to the father of her children. More Lamar Odom News:      Photos Coming soon. Photos Coming soon. Liza Morales, 36, took to Twitter on October 14 to share her grief and admiration for Lamar Odom, 35, after he was rushed to the hospital with dire complications from an alleged overdose. The father of her kids, and once her longtime love, Lamar is deep within Lizaâs thoughts at this time.   Â Khloe & Lamar ~ Season 2 (2 Disc Set) (PAL) (REGION 2 & 4) Â  Liza posted an image of Tupac Shakur on Twitter, complete withÂ a quote from the inspiring, uplifting rapper.Â âYou see you wouldnât ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had damaged petals. On the contrary, we would all celebrate its tenacity. We would all love its will to reach the sun. Well; we are the roses, this is the concrete, and these are my damaged petals.â She clearly had Lamar on her mind when posting this. Liza doesnât post to Twitter very often (her last tweet before this was on August 14), but she reached out on a tragic, terrible day to share something beautiful about someone misunderstood, in need of love. Like many of Lamarâs other loved ones â LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Caitlyn Jenner â Liza is defending Lamar from those judging his alleged drug usage. Per the quote, Lamar has had an incredibly difficult life, and heâs come out rough around the edges because of his struggles. He shouldnât be disparaged; he should be supported for trying to survive. pic.twitter.com/yo9hKCIbjx â Liza M (@TruLiza4u) October 14, 2015  Liza has shared much of this heartbreak with Lamar. Their six-month-old baby, Jayden, died in 2006 due to SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome). Itâs a heartbreak no parent could ever forget, and a bond that Liza and Lamar will always share. The two are also parents to DestinyÂ and Lamar Jr. Liza and Lamar may not be together, but there is definitely love and devotion abound. Our thoughts remain with Lamar and his loved ones at this time. â Samantha WilsonÂ  The Best Backstage Fall '16 Shoe Shots At New York Fashion Week TVLine Items: Hutcherson to Hulu, S.H.I.E.L.D.

As we reported, Chris Brown is supposedly the father of a 9-month-old baby girlâ¦ And the mother is 31-year-old model Nia Gonzalez. Well, just exactly who is the woman at the center of the controversy? Here's what we know so far:  1. She also goes by Nia Amey and is originally from Texas.  2. In addition to modeling, she's a nursing student.  3. She has several photos posted on ModelMayhem.com.  4. Gonzales has also appeared in several music videos including Phill Wade's Dreams of You.  5. Her and Chris have known each other for years and are NOT in a relationship.  6. They were rumored to be sleeping together in the summer of 2013, which is when the baby would have been conceived.  7. She partied with Chris Brown's now ex Karrueche Tran in May 2013 in Las Vegas. There are even Instagram photos of them circulating. Unfortunately, Karreuche had NO idea Nia and Chris were hooking up. Here is one where Tran actually has her arm around Nia:  S/O them They always #STAYTRU !! @msblairr #SexiiNia @christinamilian @karrueche @karizma22 A photo posted by Kid Red (@kidred) on May 26, 2013 at 5:37pm PDT  And here is one of Chris at the same party:  If you ain't freakin, We ain't Speakin A photo posted by Kid Red (@kidred) on May 26, 2013 at 4:58pm PDT   8.

Everyone's been wondering if Kanye West is the next Amanda Bynes of Twitter... but it seems like those close to him aren't too concerned. A longtime pal of the rapper told People: "I haven't felt personally concerned about his well being. Every time I talk with him â which is almost every day â he's extremely good-natured, [and] in a great mood." Concerns for the fashion designer's mental health stemmed from two separate interviews with former collaborators, Rhymefest and Malik Yusef, who both expressed being worried at the Grammys on Monday. Related: Kanye West Goes On ANOTHER Twitter Rant However, the source is suspicious of their motives: "I personally don't feel that the Grammys red carpet is an appropriate place to express concern for the 'health of your friend.' All those guys do is talk about Kanye. There can be all types of motivations there. Both of those guys are extremely talented, don't get me wrong, but for years [they've] been talking about Kanye in the press." Fair enough. As you could probably guess, it's no coincidence all this attention is coming at the same time as Ye's launch of his album The Life of Pablo and Yeezy Season 3. The insider shared:

Via TMZ: Chief Keef â prodigy rapper, horrible parent â finally paid off some of the $20,900 he owes in child support â¦ ponying up JUST enough cash to keep his ass from getting arrested â¦ again. TMZ has obtained court docs which show on October 21st, the judge in Cook County, IL made Keef an offer he couldnât refuse â cut a check for $11k to your baby mama and you wonât go to jail. Keef (smartly) forked over the dough â¦ which means cops wonât be ordered to arrest him on sight. But Keef ainât exactly out of the woods yet â the rapper is due back in court on December 10 to face the music for blowing off mandatory child support hearings earlier this year. If the judge finds Keef to be in contempt, he could be sent back to the slammer â¦ where heâs already been this year (twice!) for drug-related offenses. Here is a photo of Keefâs first baby mama and daughter. Yes, he has impregnated two other women as wellâ¦   Well, it looks like Keefâs other, other baby mama finally got her child support check because she recently posted this photo on her IG:  Really? We just hope Sosaâs daughter is getting a piece of that child support check before he mama spends it all on a new toy. Hit the flip for moreâ¦ Reblogged this on Servin' Up The Tea and commented:

 TMZ Live: Paul McCartney: Music Legend REJECTED at Grammy After-Party Kanye West Shopping at Jacob & Co.  Chris BrownÂ is chomping at the bit to face his baby mama in custody court ... and the biggest weapon in his arsenal is the woman's boyfriend.Â  Chris and Nia Guzman will fight it out in 2 weeks. She wants full custody of 1-year-oldÂ RoyaltyÂ and visitation for Chris, BUT only if it's monitored. She says he's a bad guy who hangs with criminals and smokes weed. Chris wants joint custody.Â  But we're told Chris thinks her argument will boomerang right back in her face, because her boyfriend, King Ba -- the guy who lived with her and is even named on Royalty's birth certificate -- is a wanted man ... on the run for felony forgery.Â  We're told Chris is eager to tell the judge Nia has terrible judgment ... hooking up with a con man. As we first reported, Chris believes Nia's real motivation has nothing to do with custody ... she wants to squeeze more child support out of him. He's currently paying $2,500. She wants $15k. As for Nia, her rep tells us, she's no longer with King Ba.   HERE'S THE RUNDOWN The Weeknd's Big Night Ended Face-to-Face with Police Kaley Cuoco May Have a New Man: Sam Hunt!

 Manny Pacquiao Wearing Nike   Ex-NBA superstar Gilbert Arenas UNLEASHED on his baby mama Laura Govan -- claiming she blows the $20k he gives her every month on clothes for Instagram "for u f*cks to hit the like button." Arenas is LIVID -- and clearly blames Laura for negative stories about him in the media ... in which he feels he's painted as a deadbeat dad to their 4 young children.Â  Enter Gilbert on social media last night ... putting Laura right in the crosshairs.Â  "I always read about what kind of dad I am but I've never posted about it so who's telling yall? let me guess the mother RIGHT im a Deadbeat??" In his rant, Gilbert says he's set up each of his kids with a $300k college fund, plus he pays for everything from private school to food, clothes, house, cars, etc.Â  Then he goes after Laura -- "She gets 20k a month but if u read what I do then ask urself what does she do with 20k ...she has to feed the kids at home, pay for gas to get them to school and pay her phone bill andddddddd that's it." He added, "She gets 20k to buy her self clothes for #IG for u f*cks to hit the like button." "She has 2 million dollar closet but my kids look like their bums half the damn time they get posted and I'm the #Deadbeat....if I'm a #deadbeat and a bad father WHAT the f*ck are the rest of the fathers called??? Yall can call me what u want but i bet yall want me as ur baby daddy smdh." The fight between these two is clearly nasty -- with Laura having previously asked a judge for aÂ restraining order against Gilbert, though her request was shot down.Â

 BAFANA Bafana star Andile Jaliâs baby mama, Unathi 
Nombona, is said to have found love. Unathi is alleged to have won the heart of another 
former football star, Siyabonga Nkosi, who used to play for Kaizer Chiefs. 
Unathi dumped Andile, who plies his trade in Belgium and 
is currently engaged to fitness guru and former Diski Divas star, 
Nonhle Ndala.After the breakup, Unathi allegedly took a break from 
serious relationships, but seems to have made up her mind about 
finding another soulmate.Sources close to her told Sunday Sun she 
and Siyabonga have been seeing each other for a while and have been going out a 
lot together.Describing her as an all-time-bragger, a source said 
Unathi (31) has been posting cheerful photos of herself and Nkosi (35) on some 
of their outings.In some photos, Unathi and Siyabonga are seen having fun 
with Unathiâs friend, actress Zola Nombona who stars in e.tvâs Zibondiwe.âUnathi works in Durban and Siyabonga often visits her 
on the coast. Sheâs madly in love with Siya and it looks like 
they are both enjoying being together,â said a source. Another source even claimed Siyabonga quit playing 
football to spend more time with Unathi.Another source added that sheâs hoping this relationship 
works as both lovebirds are around the same age.âUnathi was five years older than Andile, which might 
have had a negative impact on their relationship,â added another source. 
A third source added: âUnathiâs into cute soccer 
players. Her friends are happy for her because they think the two are a match 
made in heaven.âWhen Sunday Sun contacted Siyabonga for 
comment, he said: âIâm not dating anyone at the moment. Iâm not dating Unathi,â 
then hung up on the SunTeam.Unathi was not available for comment.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");photo-groupÂ

Recent Comments 25.01.2016  at 1:43 pm By BellaNaija.com 119 Comments   Since news broke this morning on LIB about Wizkidâs alleged second baby mama, the pop star has stayed away from social media and has so far not officially confirmed or denied the reports. While we wait for his official statement, here are a few things to note about the lady who just might be the mother of Wizkidâs second son.  According to reports, the alleged baby mama and Wizkid have been in a quiet relationship for a while and when she became pregnant things were kept on the low till she gave birth and shared the name of her son with her Instagram followers. She announced the babyâs name to be Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun â which is Wizkidâs exact first, middle and last names â but she has now edited the name on her Instagram page to simply reflect her babyâs initials which are AIB.   After a little digging we found out her name is Binta Diamond Diallo and she is from Guinea.  She is also friends with US reality star Natalie Nunn who told her congratulations on the birth of her half-Nigerian son on Twitter a couple of days ago. She also loves Wizkidâs music and a lot of his songs off the âAyoâ album are her go-to songs. Binta was definitely spotted with Wizkid when he was in Houston in May 2015 (about 9 months ago) for an Industry Nite performance and in some photos she posted on Instagram Wizkid can be seen in the background.   A couple of days ago Wizkid shared on his Twitter account a cryptic âT Baby Foreverâ message which a lot of people assumed was about Tania Omotayo (click here) Photo Credit: Instagram â @bluediamond224 | Facebook â BintaDiamond Living & Celebrating the African Dream!

Run for your dear life if you get senseâ¦ ghen ghenâ¦ where is that appointed popcorn seller??? this is  an upgrade oâ¦â¦â¦.*runsawaywhiledodgingpurewatersatchets* Lol i find this so funny Now is the time for Durex or Gold circle to have an ambassador and relaunch or smthn. A lot of our Nigerian celebrities have forgotten these brands  are in the market. These celebrities and even regular Nigerians need sex education for adults. I wonder if ppl are not even concerned about STDâs. Lol KUNU PLEASE!!!! listening to hopsin âbaby mamaâ RN Wait o, are these people aware that HIV and other serious life threatening STIâs are real? or nah?
I am starting to think most of these men are allegic to Condom and do not believe they can catch any illness
Tufiakwa!!!
All the same congratulations! @sonia paloma HIV is real but itâs curable. Itâs no longer deadly. Many Nigerian celebrities already have it and STI is nothing. As long as, they are taking their medication. And thereâs been many cases where spouses or partner dont even contract it. Nigeria has one of the largest number of people living with HIV, and itâs disappointing that they will rather brush it under the rug as opposed to address such epidemic. As usual, Nigerians are in denial. All those sudden deaths, sickness, people are dying left, right and center but nobody will disclose what the sickness is a high probability is HIV/AIDS, where they didnt go for testing or found out too late. My cousin, is a pharmacist in Abuja and itâs a high percentage in the north especially among young women. He said, dont let those pretty face fool you, many Nigerians are suffering. Some of the men have it, going for treatment but wonât disclose it to their wives or girl.
I had an uncle who died of AIDS, but till today few family members knew. His wife actually knew after death. But family and friends said it was cancer. THERE IS NO CURE FOR AIDS!!!! It is still a very deadly disease. How can you make such a false and misleading statement???? There is NO CURE for HIV yet. It can only be medically managed to slow its progression. There is no cure for HIV. The incidence of the disease, among certain groups, is increasing rapidly. The prevalence is also growing because it has moved from a death sentence, in countries where screening and ART treatment are routine, to a chronic disease. Nevertheless, it is remains a burden on the individual, their family and the larger society. Please donât post inaccurate information. Do some research and learn well well what you are talking about. @everybody  Sorry guys, I didnât explain myself better. I know itâs bot curable. I was being sarcastic as to the reason many still live a reckless life knowing the consequence of it. They feel like HIV will not kill them, and if they do certain things it will cure them from the virus or prevent it from AIDS. They didnt get the memo Hmmmm. This comments section na my room today! Oya o! See gist. Tania wassup??? ***He seem to like light skinned ladies***More money, more women â more problems!! Congrats dear! This âbabymamaâ business is fast growing and becoming  quite competitive , and you women say you want Gender equality , equal respect and recognition in the society ? Well , not like this ! Youâre not ready ! Na these thirsty hoes make it hard for us to seek gender equality.  We will keep fighting regardless of the high level of hoeism! Lmao.. Your comment cracked me up Hahaha! Lol @ high level of hoeism ! Choi! Itâs not our fault. Women like this stay throwing us under the bus. All dem side chicks, mistresses and baby mamas are really destroying the image of women. These women also fall under the umbrella of feminism. After all, they CHOSE their path despite how deplorable we may find it. Frankly, the only hoe I see in all this is Wizard. Bruhhhâ¦.. KÃ­ lÃ³ dÃ©, á¹£e Ã á¹£Ã¬á¹£e ni? Sigh ð©ð©itâs also his choice. Tania Omotayo â you see your life on the outside in the playground? Se o ri aiye e ni ita gbangba. Dumb girl forming solidarity with annie idibia. Did we not warn you that this your suffer head of yesterday na stories that touch of today? I want to flog this giirl madly. Haha how can we all see this coming yet you the main character missed this coming. Haha. Step mother of life. @jide u too funny. âyou see your lifeâ¦.playgroundâ hahaha Taniaâ¦even Michael Jackson cannot eat popcorn to this Lol Michael Jackson kwa? I have retired for you Nigerians loool Oh well, passport things maybe.
 And bf u all come for Wizkid (who needs to change that his moinker by the way), many of your entertainers have âabroadâ babies. So many of themâ¦.married and single. Nothing new.
 One of the Okoye boys too (not Paul) gat a child  in the US too.  Americana  mama is paid to shut up so she wonât spoil their happy family brand. And yes, the wife knows T-Baby should go to mentor Annie for coping skills if sheâs still determined to die there. If itâs the case, then itâll be a damn shameâ¦and sheâs ainât from a poor home, why the desperation? Annie Idibia, if u are the one encouraging Omotayo to stick there abeg,stop. Carry your cross yourself. If youâre comfortable with  âlong-sufferingâ âemotionally batteredâ ,as your second and third names, this should not be this girlâs portion. See how this vibrant  lady  don age due to stress.
OMOTAYO, FORCE YOURSELF: PICK YOUR DIGNITY THIS TIME AND GO!!! DONâT REDUCE YOUR MARKET VALUE AGAIN LIKE THAT!!! I donât want to be Tania Omotayo right now, that awkward moment when your Ayodeji just broke your heart. Kepler my dear. Sending some e-hugs you way cause you will need it. Iâm so happy Wizkid is following Godâs instruction to âgo ye forth and multiplyâ . More Lube to your Kajones HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA || SO FUNNY WizKid!!! small man with plenty action! Hahahahahaha!!! Tania come holla at ur boy! Even your boo get a booâ¦.and sons! So these young men wld jus be going about nacking raw and they somehow know how to locate the very fertile women. Popcorn plix! I will comeback for comments am a patient sombori, bella9ja pple no disappoint abeg Ki lo n se awon omo yi . Why do some adults behave so irresponsibly and tamper with the life a child by not taking adequate protection. Bringing children they wonât be totally there for into the world. Spending lots of money, buying things money can buy is not what a child needs the most, time, nuturing, attention, closesness is the number one need of a child. Which i donât think Wizkid can provide, heâs all over the place now, heâs not mature enough to be a dad yet.
All this women too with no intergrity, dignity nor pride, spreading their legs open for all sundry regardless of when D has been, e gbagbe atubotan ni. I pity all the children that get caught in all this web.
I remember when youâll sweat blood before woman go gree your own, when it was a shameful act to fall pregnant outside marriage.
Pleas those who truly love Tania should encourage her not to throw her life away  by waiting for this boy and not have to endure a marriage with him all in the name of love. All that glitters is not gold, Tania donât do like that aunty wey dey shine teeth for public but in the deepest part of her heart, she just dey endure. Move forward with your life, there are good men out there. One that will respect, adore and cherish you. Wizkid boutta increase his performance fees cos of child support.. Rotfl.. Dear Tania God will take care of you Poor tania kpele, please leave this guy abeg heâs not worth it at all. na wa baby daddy gist can bring out the apkroko in somebody, see me waiting for comments like someone who doesnât have work Na âlong-throatâ cause am  â¦ but wait o ..no wonder naija girls dey bleach anyhow  â¦na soso yellow girls all these small boys dey chase around. â¦..and Tania Omotayo is a PAID EMPLOYEE to ACT as Wizkidâs girl. and to name the kid exactly the same, that is so âno chillâ , this is one competitive girl.  Woah. *singing*â¦.Wizzybbaby BABA NLAaaaaâ¦â¦â¦ I can actually flee the glee on how people would comment( i am not an exception)
Heheheheâ¦ this is too juicy eh And the drama goes on and onâ¦ Whoâs next???
Poor Tania I feel for you girl. I donât feel for her. She was too unreasonable, she should have left him since. Sheâs not on his level at all, in class, in education, in everything, I always wonder why she agreed to date the loser in the 1st place. She allowed someone thatâs not up to her, to disregard her and disrespect her severely and severally, publicly. Itâs very shameful. I hope you finally have the sense to leave. This boy has shown you time after time that he has no regard for you. And heâs really spoiling your âmarketâ if you donât know. Itâs a pity that your friends couldnât advise you, or perhaps you didnât listen to them. hmmmn no b wizzy fault o.DAT gal just wan  be he baby mama. Young boys of these days are very fertile  oooo. Na jst to sneez few times na pikin go pop out.  As for me I tap into this new buisness venture in d year 2016. Na to open nursery around lekki area. Give baby mama time off to do other thinz Rotflmao! You BNers are the best for your comments alone. @shady has come up with business on top baby mama drama. Hahahaha just passingâ¦ BN pls when will u start to share some popcorn and drinks while we sit and watch how our celebs baby mama contest chart goes on?? I bet you all, some or should I say most of these entertainers are walking around with HIV/STIs. So, they donât care. They are sharing it. Their wives are aware, some of their girlfriends are aware so, they stay because theyâve been exposed to it. So, why should they leave? I agree.there is got to be HIV and other STDs in this mix that we canât see. Belle is just conspicuous and canât be hidden. I am the official popcorn seller today here. Halls at your girl peeps lol. I full ground here. I have salted and sugar too im nt sure y i got angry on seeing n reading dis. oh well, Tania isnt a baby n she shuld knw dt dis shuld b a wake up call for her. hw irresponsible r d youths of today jor??? Iâm feri dump folded *in Falzâ voice*  okay back to the matter at hand, since the baby mama thing is now a lucrative business, Iâm not gonna be surprised if any lady starts to unearth what transpired between her and a famous celebrity. But seriously I donât know why Tania hasnât left Wizkid before now. IMO All these contraceptive people should come out and rebrand oooo..Things are taking a different turn..Women falling our hand since 1960.See the smally that she opened leg for instead of insisting on a condom or drinking a morning abi na afternoon after pillâ¦Let us see how this Wizkidsâs small change that is making him entice his seniors will multiply 10years from now..He should just be called Whizman, using the name Whizkid to give people kids. Nwa ojooooo. Asili gbakute Nigeriansâ¦How e take concern una? Look at irrelevant ppl talking abt how they advised Tamia lol..She doesnt know any of you and neither does Wizkidâ¦..Some of una don do abortion tire and some will drink wizzies cum like milk shake and be baby mama 3â¦â¦Holier than Christ freaking naija pplâ¦.Wizkid is not ur youth pastor or role model for whatever u lot profess as ur standards for moralityâ¦.his a young entertainer with money and in his line of work a lot of girls are bound to be pregnant for himâ¦â¦its just the real world and not the deluded ideal world yall live inâ¦..his already made enough money to take care of 2 kids and 2 women if he secures his finances wiselyâ¦.why dont u guys for onve worry about getting somewhere first abi na una sister wizzy give belle??â¦news is not even confirmed yet and all u Judge Judys don pronounce judgement finish..ndi uchu if you love tania for ever so why did you go have a child with a second lady  thats sound ignoring. hope tania will not rush to get preggos to keep her man   ..like anna banner tinz I donât get the whole point of sharing these images on social media, this are issue you celebrate in private with your love ones, considÃ©ring itâs a sensitive matter. When stupid men mess around with opportunist like this , this is what happens. Itâs all smiles now, but we all know how this story will end an angry and spiteful baby mama. As for Tania I hope she walks out with her head up, no women deserve this from any man. And you guys quite calling her stupid. Okay, sheâs very smart. Tania the most gorgeous dumbest foolish girl on the planet getting all her advice from Anne Idibia. You are so dumb. Hang in there and wait, He will marry you in 2020 when naijgagistlive warned you â you blocked her and privatised your Instagram. Ewu, â you are such a beautiful yet dumb girl Ahn ahn wizkid you don vexx? No respect for family name again,and who born all the âmagasâ? Dear Lord deliver us from #Yorubademons and may you give them the wisdom to always use a condomðð¿ Please direct the prayer to Flavor as well whoâs Igbo, and 2face whoâs Tiv. The Yoruba boys slander is getting old and boring. Well, this kind activities are not new to the entertainment industry.  King Sunny Ade has how many kids by how many women?
FELA has how many kids by how many women?
2face
Bob Marley
Diddy
Kwam1 And the list goes on and on and onâ¦. Being a baby mama is now a full time job! oya ladies, please send your CV to the ministry of baby mamaâs and side chics, all applicants be forewarned the selection process will be extremely intense & competitive so please be prepared to step up your A-plus thot game or else nothing for you..
Only qualification required is that you are able to poke me on the side and know your place while I show off my main chic in public, your silence will be greatly rewarded.. ask 2baba, OBO & whiskey â¦. ð yes, their friendship  started from when  2face & Wizkid did that  Hennessy Artistry gig .  lol, so Annie coached her to be patient i guess? . as someone said earlier, 2 babies down , 3 to go . lmao the question is WHY HAS TANIA FALLEN PREGNANT ALL THIS WHILE i mean they been together so long too right typo: WHY HASNT TANIA FALLEN PREGNANT too u kinda get point oh, mayb she insist wizzy use protective all the time, or she use drug later, who knows i pray for the day several NAIJA celebs or some of these hoes they been fking will get FULL BLOWN aids, to serve as a warning to all others I get the sentiment behind this comment, but this is harsh. Plus, I donât think it will make people change their behavior. this is such a messâ¦â¦â¦â¦ f8ck bois everywhere, greedy hoes getting preg cos of lil fame and cashâ¦â¦â¦â¦.. T BABY FOREVERâ¦â¦â¦â¦ CONTINUE â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.after 3 to go as someone said, then dont worry ur pretty head , na u get the ring and white wedding plus bella naija full coverage .. aiiâ¦â¦â¦â¦.stay put dearie â¦â¦â¦â¦ u sef go born ur own!!!!!â¦â¦. i wonder if she has parents sef? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha this killed me Baby mama is a very lucrative business someone is collecting 300k + asking for official car while I am here with my b.sc collecting 60k salary Tania!! Tania!!! Make I put mouth for dis ting, leave Wizkid alone o!! Build yourself, start again! Move on!!!!!!! Donât listen to Annie o!!! Poor Tania â this is what happens when women donât believe in themselves. It will be a sad story if she sticks with him. Really sad. Tania pls I beg you move on Donât these celefools fear for their lives (I know most of them are brainless)? How could they be having unprotected sex just like that? Do they really think they are immune to HIV or STDs? God knows how many unprotected sex they have had in the past. Everywhere they go, they have sex (Unprotected), from Ghana to Namibia, from Uganda to Lesotho, from Kenya to Haiti. Oga o. Tania, am sure you reading or a friend will send to you, I AM AVAILABLE for you ohhhh My question is this, is it that when theyâre high they forget what CONDOM is. Like someone said, most of these celebrities have diseases and probably their partner knows or have it too so he/she gat to stay. Its a shame Feminist idealism â¦.truly good to bed.. Bellanaija I wanted to help yall out here with an interesting topic Well some east African friends and I were discussing Diamond Platinumz (the Tanzania crooner and hit maker) and Zari the Ugandan socialite and mother of 3 (before he met Diamond) he supposedly has had a baby girl with few months ago,  Well most of East Africa dont believe its his considering Zaris reputation. Every one is giving Diamond Pressure to take a DNA and he is in lvoe and trust his woman and said HE will not and personally i think he has a right to say he wont, if he knows his woman well (even if they only dated for 6 months), and know thats baby is his. They should leave him alone sha.  But anyway so during the discussion another fellow nigerian with us also chimed in and said  thats no big deal cos statistics show 5-10% of kids in nigerian married homes DO NOT BELONG TO THE MEN of which most of these men dont know. I wassshocked? really? 5%- 10% â Bella is it true, have you heard these statistics.  please lets post this controversial topic â because id love to know what people think â the discussion about DNA â how many kids in average nigerian married homes do not belong to the husband. years ago a gorgeous christian loving neighbor with 5 kids whose husband had won the green card lottery and traveled to US, finally filed and decided after settling down for the lady to join with all 5 kids, cut long story short, you know how american embassy lately will do DNA before allowing kids to enter with green card and stuff, anyway sha, None of the 5 kids belong to the man. Imagine that,. Not even one.  The most controversial story in our neighborhood in 2014. See shame. The Secret Lives of Baba Segiâs Wives, a novel by Lola Shoneyin.
Whatever, just take care of all Godâs children. As in ehn, the way these kiddos let loose their stuff and spray babies everywhere, you go fear. When will wiz borrow himself some brain? One baby mama aint enough stress already? Its as if the fear of hiv and stds is not even there for these kids. My dear they are not allergy.they are just lazy,i mean take your condom there finish and dispose yourself cause there something called TURKEY BASTER you donât know but your baby mama is well informed. siging Even ya boo get a Boo *gone to bed* So a guy cheats and flirts but there is this particular girl he loves and adores. Hey, if at this point you still believe that nonsense, then youre very ignorant and naive BELLA QUOTING LIB with her link embedded
So now you are  partner sites  abi, no wonder, It all makes sense now
Sharing traffic abi? Itâs nothing new, BN usually gives credit (as they rightly should) when another site breaks a big story first, whether itâs LIB or SDK or whoever, with a link to the story. There are many past examples. abi all dis male celebs no get condom size ni? Haha,the company must hear about thisâ¦â¦.the rate is becoming alarming! *sighs* Babymama business booming since the time of Fela. Tani bae..I see what youâre goingâ¦ Modelling karrueche. If thatâs the business model, ,carry go, after all no work for naija.  Make your money, get your endorsements, launch a career off the back of this gigolo. But if na love, my hand no dey o. The only thing this auntie no get ba shame. I just imagined that small boy on top of her. Nawao You love her but here you are airing her dirty laundry to strangers. With friends like you who needs enemies. why is Tania getting trolled ?
what has she done to deserve all this abuse?
is it a crime to be a loving and supportive girlfriend? please direct all your insults to the accused/suspect.. Sheâs not getting trolled. Most people who are abusing her are just mad because sheâs such a sweet person and doesnât deserve to be in this messy situation. Itâs not a crime to be a loving and supportive girlfriend, but itâs a crime not to love yourself and itâs also a crime to be naive and irrational. This guy has disrespected her time after time, she had the opportunity of leaving him ages ago, and she didnât. Now this, thatâs why people are mad. No one is trolling at her, people are just mad. If someone doesnât have regard for you, you shouldnât give them the opportunity to continue to do so. He just shamed the poor girl publicly. I wish she listened to her family and friends that earlier warned her. Small rich boys be chooking without condoms with total disregard for their penises and world population.  Please watch my dramatic views on Nigerian trending issues and more here o jare Idoma.. Tuface is Idoma congrats â¦ no just meâ¦backs away slowlyâ¦runsâ¦ If this is the same Binta Diallo I know from Albany, then congrats to her. This is actually her second child These baby mamas are just desperate!Haba!!
@Taniaâ¦..respect yourself and forget this guy.He doesnât love you as you can see.But if you want to die there,may una mama head help you. tania i hope you will wait some more wow! 2016 is sure a great yearâ¦. more tinz awaits us in the mediaâ¦ first is maima vs ice prince, now wizkid the problem we fans have is insulting the artist, where as people who have no money or post did what is more worst than theirs. plan about urself and leave the artist alone, tania has her reason for staying with wizkid. is child an insult? what if tania is not able to conceive? You people shud be thereâ¦. Tania and Wiz will soon release âloved up'â Photo as she no gree learn.. Oshi o da ile pako!!!!

 The former special adviser on media and publicity to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Reuben Abati,Â hasÂ voiced his opinion on the entireÂ Davido vs. Sophie and Dele Momodu baby mama saga.  Reuben Abati Reuben Abati in an opinion piece on his Facebook page advised Davido, Sophie and her uncle, Dele Momodu, not to give unnecessary publicity to little Imade Adeleke. He wrote: âThey should not forget there is a child involved. They have suddenly made Imade Adeleke, the most famous victim of Baby Mama-Baby Papa palaver in Nigeria. Both Davido and Sophie and their supporterâ clubs should please protect the baby and not make her a poster child for that kind of subject.â READ ALSO:Â How David And Baby Mama Sign Peace Accord Papers The piece, written in the form of a dialogue between Abati and a friend,Â analysed the ongoing social media war of words between Davido and Dele Momodu and the publicâs âenjoymentâ of the sordid details revealed each day like on some bad soap opera. âBut me, I am enjoying the story oh,â one of Abatiâs characters says. While the other replies:Â âOf course, too many sadists in our land enjoy other peopleâs misery. Abati, however, pointed outÂ what was most important and why the matter was not an affair for public eyes and ears. READ ALSO:Â 10 Major Facts From The Davido, Dele Momodu And Baby Mama Drama He wrote:Â âThatâs why it is the child that is most important. I donât like the way they have turned the young girl into a trophy to be fought over in a blood sport. We are in the age of the internet. Twenty years from today, someone could print out these funny details from the internet memory bank. A father, grandfather and a half-sister fighting a mother and her family over a baby and making sordid claims: It is not a fight that can be easily won.â Since late December, the Momodus have been in embroiled in a tug of war with the Adelekes over the custody of Sophie and Davidoâs daughter, Imade. Davido, in several posts on social media, accused Sophie of being a bad mother and âinfectingâ her child with cannabis while Dele Momodu, the publisher of Ovation and Sophieâs cousin, has claimed, also via social media, that the Adelekes are trying to use their wealth to muscle a mother out of the life of her daughter.

          More trouble for Wizkid as 2nd baby mama opens up  
citifmonline Most comprehensive and credible Political, Business, Sports, Entertainment, Lifestyle, Health and General news website in Ghana.

First it was a night club fight and now, itâs even something more controversial and messy. The father of one has tried so hard to distance himself from social media scandals, but recent events have shown that the pop star has been proved wrong. Earlier in the week, news broke that the pop star has another love child by a second baby mama, Binta Diamond Diallo who hails from Guinea, though Wizkid has not confirmed or denied the rumour about him having another child with his alleged baby mama, Binta Diamond Diallo. Sources close to Wizkid confirmed that his erstwhile girlfriend, Tania Omotayo, broke up with him recently, though both of them had a mutual understanding to remain civil and matured about the new development, all in a bid to avoid media scandals. Obviously, this is why she has kept her distance from the music star for some time now. She even boycotted most of wizkidâs events. One of such events was his Industry Nite. Tania was on vacation to Dubai with her friends. Could this have been possible if they were still love birds? It looks like Wizkid has been caught in a web spun with his own hands. The news of his second baby mama seems to ring true. According to reports, the alleged baby mama, Binta Diamond and Wizkid have been in a secret relationship for some time now. When she became pregnant they kept the relationship on a low key till she gave birth and shared the name of her son on her Instagram page. Surprisingly, she named the child after the star boy, â Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun â which is Wizkidâs exact first, middle and last names. Since the news broke out about Wizkidâs alleged second baby mama, the pop star has avoided the social media and has so far not officially confirmed or denied the rumour. Meanwhile, reports had it that Binta Diallo has made some new revelation regarding her new-born son. She was said to have explained why she intentionally named her son after the Afro-pop star, saying it was to avoid a repeat of the situation with Wizkidâs first baby mama- Oluwanishola Ogudugu. When Sola had the singerâs son in 2011, Wizkid repeatedly denied having any child until the evidence was too immense for him to run from. Binta, having learned from Solaâs experience, didnât want to fall into such a media ordeal, and as such, chose to expose the fact that she had just given birth to Wizkidâs son. However, in a statement during the week, his management said, Wizkid hasnât confirmed the news making the rounds that he has fathered another child. âWizkid still hasnât confirmed any news about him having another child. We know he is single and will be releasing his EP next month.â Wizkid alleged baby mama is said to be a Guinean model based in the United States. She has taken to her instagram page to release pictures of herself during pregnancy.â â

 TMZ Live: Paul McCartney: Music Legend REJECTED at Grammy After-Party Kanye West Shopping at Jacob & Co.  Chris Brown's baby mama claims the singer is not only a bad influence on their kid ... he's making the child sick.Â  Nia GuzmanÂ claims 1-year-old Royalty has developed asthma, and she says it's all because Chris has exposed her to an extreme amount of secondhand smoke. Brown is a weed and tobacco enthusiast. Nia says when Royalty comes back from a visit with Chris she usually reeks of smoke.Â  Guzman also claims in legal docs she's worried Chris is abusing drugs and has relapsed ... especially with sizzurp. Nia wants to restrict Chris' visitation ... asking the judge to force him to hire a full-time nanny or pull back on his right to be around the child. Â  She also wants the judge to force Chris to take random drug tests, prohibit him from using drugs or consuming alcohol around Royalty, and stop him from smoking around their daughter.Â  And Nia wants more child support ... she's getting $2,500 a month but wants it upped to nearly $16k a month. We've reached out to Chris' attorney for comment ... so far, no word back.  HERE'S THE RUNDOWN The Weeknd's Big Night Ended Face-to-Face with Police Kaley Cuoco May Have a New Man: Sam Hunt! Manny Pacquiao is in Hot Water over His Anti-Gay Comments Scott Disick: Heading to 'Dancing with the Stars"?  Looks likeÂ Kanye West has competition in the "shoes worth selling your soul for" department ... from Michael Jordan andÂ Drake ... whose new collab shoe is the new flavor of theâ¦  Chris Brownâs Daughter Has Asthma And His Baby Mama Says Itâs All His Fault  Itâs nice to see that things between Worldâs Best Dadâ¦mug owner Chris Brown and the mother of his daughter, Nia Guzman, are still a mess as usual. It all started yesterday when Nia announced that their almost two-year-old daughter Royalty has asthma and accused Chris of being the reason why. According to Nia, Chris Brown loves weed and cigarettes more than their kid, and heâs constantly exposing her to second-hand smoke. Nia says Royalty usually comes home from Daddyâs house smelling like Mary-Kate Olsenâs wedding reception, and she wants a judge to force Chris Brown to hire a nanny to take care of Royalty. Of course, thatâs not all Nia wants a judge to make happen. Nia also wants a judge to add a couple zeros to her monthly child support checks. Nia is currently getting $2500, but wants that changed to $16,000. This isnât the first time Nia has come for Chrisâ cash; back in July, Nia was trying to get $15,000 a month. Sadly, she was about as successful at getting money as Chris Brown is at not saying dumb shit, and thatâs how she ended up at $2500 a month. Speaking of Chris Brown saying dumb shit. Shortly after Nia accused him of fucking up Royaltyâs lungs with second-hand smoke, TMZ says that Chris released a statement of his own on Instagram, which has since been yanked down. Chris side-eyed Niaâs claims that Royalty got asthma from his smoking. Chris says he quit smoking cigarettes on New Years, and that no one smokes around his daughter. According to Chris, Nia is just trying to stuff more money into her bank account. âWell DUHâ said Niaâs shameless $16,000 a month child support request. Chris says he stopped smoking cigarettes, but he failed to mention anything about not smoking weed. Although he doesnât exactly have to. That busted Venus de Milo tattoo on his head is all the proof a judge needs that Chris Brown is in a committed long-term relationship with drugs. Regardless of whether or not Chris Brown is the reason Royalty has asthma, one thing is obvious; Nia needs to work on her get money game. Youâve got to keep it simple, Nia! Forget about the asthma story â Iâm sure a judge would have accepted the following: âYour honor, my child is exposed to Chris Brown. Can I have more money please?â Pic: Wenn.com

Wow! Interesting exposÃ©! But no side should be judged or defended now until Sophia releases her side of the story, but yall shud notice Sophia was with imade all through xmas holidays, so where is the kidnap accusation coming from? Interesting family
 
I have read and digested this article and come to conclusion that Davido made the First mistake by having unprotected sex with sophia.. Since the did has been done, no need to Lament or lash around.they should just call for a Family meeting to resolve this issue before it really gets out of hand.. Anyway#WhoshouldItell

Now you both deal wuth it in private and stop airing out ur dirty laundry, ass, dick  and titties for us to see. Enough of this childish point scoring I say!!!
 
David jst keep being a gud dad 2 ur baby.God bless u
 
Yup, Davido wrote this. The English is TRAGIC!! This proves that even with a million dollar education, a blockhead is a blockhead
 
Story for the gods. Adeleke's are Known 4 this. Using money to cover a lot of shits
 
Yup, Davido wrote this. The English is TRAGIC!! This proves that even with a million dollar education, a blockhead is a blockhead
 
Nawaaa oooo girls won't just have sense fa.... you have no education, no career, no job and you have a baby with the father footing all ur bills...still you are useless fa....just receive sense should be ur resolution this year.
 
This is getting serious, too much dirty secrets are been expose
 
This boy who says nothing without mentioning his age should be told to keep quiet and push his family business somewhere....you never loved her, you slept with her countless times and even took her in....rubbish talk.Nobody wants to hear
 
Linda how is this exclusive Biko? It came from Davido(one sided ), no blame on him, just his baby mama!...I think it's only a 3rd party in the circle that can have the real exclusive gist.
 
Irrespective of your stories,you must accept and rise to the challenges of fatherhood 
 
OMG!
 
Useless Dele momodu 
 
It was a long one, but I had to read it. I was discussing this with my friend that she is looking for attention because they are not giving her funds or somethng. May God help u guys sort it. Petition my foot looool this is the real petition, its just not addressed. Loool. Plus prove sef. 
 
I've been waiting for the Adelekes family to tell the real story. Mr Famzer dele momodu go and hide your head in shame 
 
na their matter oooJst pasiingThen i saw this And end up commenting
 
Don't pay any money to that Whore ooo ! Just take ur Baby n let her be ...besides she's old enough to take care of her self
 
What an epistle!!!
 
Dele momodu is a big Goat 
 
na their matter oooJst pasiingThen i saw this And end up commenting
 
Ok noted 
 
Everything makes sense now. Sophie n her family are just bunch of schemers 
 
Quite sad! I really pity Davido. But this is a lesson to all young people, tread with caution coz you never know who has a major plan to ruin you just because you have been so blessed
 
The story too long abeg
 
Mr Davido. I patiently read you letter. I can very well say this. You are not innocent in this matter. You yourself have lived and still live a frivolous lifestyle. You also have smoked Cannabis(Igbo). I know you are not an ideal role model for the Nigerian Youth. No one forced or tricked you into having sexual intercourse with Sophia . The result is Imade. I do not dispute all you have said.. I believe most of it are true. I personally believe Sophia  might be a gold digger. However, you cant sit on this pedestal of being a victim. You are a perpetrator too. My advice for you is to give you life to Christ and change your ways. As regards what Mr Dele Momodu did, I see nothing wrong. Especially in stoping you from flying out of the country with a baby without the mother or the mother's consent. He was wrong to post your dirty linen on social media, he wasnt wrong for stopping you at the airport.Whether you like it or not, you are forever tied to Sophia  by Imade. As long as she is alive (May she live long In Jesus Name) you will be tied to Sophia . You cant separate a child from her mother no matter your reasons. So stop all this posting on social media and writing letters, we dont need your explanations. Do what is right in the sight of God and Man and keep your matters private.God Bless You All.
 
I'm lost.. Sophia.. Uncle dele.. David..please u all should find a civil way to fix this.. Please for d sake of little imade
 
Now, it all makes sense. Sophia is a slimy character. So she was actually with her child up till Dec 28th and decided to raise false alarm to her Uncle cos of Dubai trip. To think that she denied the cannabis story earlier. See evidence before our very eyes. Moral of the story: Men please zip up before you enter one chance.
 
Hmmmm, shopia is not a good mother. God help you davido and imade. 
 
Enter your comment...Only time will tell when d real truth will manifest#Haveyouprayedfornigeriatoday
 
Three sides to a storyYours, Mine and the Truth.ALHAJI_NATTY
 
Why is dis post filled with too much bullshit,David u should just get a life and stop been childish,u ve been gutted just accept and pay your fucking bills OBO.... It's best u seek advise from 2face#needanalibitojoinmetastethenewgeishasardine 
 
Long stuff
 
Wow! This is worth taking the child away from the mum.
 
I read every bit of this.. Don't even know what to type .Lord heal these people.
 
My advice for davido, let Sophia have imade then sit back and watch. Your daughter will come back to you! 
 
We have heard all this before you guys should please keep your problems to yourselves...The public will never solve the problems for you instead people will laugh and make mockery of your family....That's my take......Linda am back.....Much Love/Long Live LIB
 
Linda I have been following your blog way back from Nigeria. .. but I must confess Davido is really sick and needed urgent attention. .. why all these stories? ???? Also there is never a fire without smoke,if you have display some level of maturity and responsibility, all these wouldn't have happened. Also tou need to shut your trash by bragging about who your family is an what you guys have cos you wanna know, we don't care. The issue is about you being irresponsible and your family supporting you not to be... treat the issues and not personality. ..hence stop blaming the momodu's for your incompetence and failure as a father. .. well I hope you find favor in the eyes of the lord... sha keep your family dirty linen out of this precious blog.... for the last time,  do your responsibility as a father and stop blaming people for your failure. .. you were not forced when you were having unprotected sex...
 
Very gd... waitin for d silly sophia post her own side of d story if she's bold enof....

Can we please fight together to ensure that Imade is handed over to the Adeleke's where she will given the best medical treatment and a deserving future??Yes, a child should only stay with a sane and morally upright mother, not a weed-puffing, cannabis-smoking, night-crawling mother.
 
Lol....
 
Hmmm
 
Poor Little Angel Imade ; I pray God Give her a Sound Good Health ; Get Well Soon Dear !!! All Iz Well!!!Davido I took time to read This and I understand how U feel ; I learn a lot from your experincn. I Pray God Give More Wisdom To handle it all to the End . The Biggest Mistake a Man could Make in Life is to Marry the Wrong Woman or have a Bad woman as a Babi mama ; They tend to kill ones Dream , they selfish and self centered . David Adelake I Pray God Almighty see u through all This . All Your Hard Labor towards your Lovly Daughter will not be in Vain All Iz Well . *DEW*

It's a sad story but the issue remains that if you don't like a person why sleep with them? Why give people you don't want in your life a free pass into it. Let's be more careful with how we deal with people and people we deal with
 
Linda, in order to balance your report on this whole childish drama I'll advice and suggest you also get an "exclusive response" from Sophia the baby mama and mother of Imade.. Don't rely on a one-sided story or response. There is always more to any story. From experience in life I've learnt that there's always 3 sides to every story. In this case, Davido's side, Sophia's side and the truth. Don't believe one side hook, line and sinker. 
 
Oh! Can't believe I read dat! Think I love Davido now...
 
Oh!I took my precious time to read dis touching story and I pray dat aall dis dat happened does not affect Davido negatively.Its so obvious dat d lady is really cashing on d baby to suck Davido dry despite her irresponsible act. Wht a shame!In fact Davido I really respect u and apr8 ur coming out to dish dis truth and exposing those black souls such as Dele Momodu dat hav lost his value and true sense.Biko keep ur child away frm her and she doesn't deserve ur dime bcos u don't owe her any tin.   Kai! But some ladies r so foolish and senseless mostly dis Sophia of a girl. She is indeed a real liability dat should b lay off and kept distance away frm.End of story!
 
Enter your comment...wow,  that is alot to take in at once 
 
Money miss road people, just by dint and stroke of luck, fortunate lucky assholes think Nigeria belongs to them..... your Dr. father or Uncle has no globally acclaimed  research paper published on the net, yet he`s a doctor of what ?  Singing trash & calling it music, "Omo Baba Olowo"..... Music for me is Ebeneezer Obey, Anikulapo Kuti, Sunny Ade, & Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister. We know your grand parents humble beginnings from Ile-Ife, to Ibadan. Were the Adventists   Americans who`d helped shipped your fathers to the US in the early 80`s were like you people, there won`t be any Davido-Omo Baba Olowo today.The Adeleke`s should learn to be humble, we know those who came from wealthy backgrounds in the 50`s and 60`s in Nigeria, and their children and grand children never flaunt it..... Davido is trash ! 
 
Davido, at 21 you are not naive, you should have used a condom
 
Let's be careful of the type of people we deal with. 
 
Aww poor little innocent child...get well soon honeyStory too long, I was almost dozing off...

Abeg abeg make we hear word !!you and all the hkn gang smoked all day ,everyday when she was around you ,so you are as guilty !! Maybe Na thru ur genes sef n infected sperm tht the poor child got from ;!!mcheeww
 
Davido u r nt d first baby daddy,why cnt dey live you alone.they simply want money n recognition.
 
Well they should settle this issue amicably, enough of this drama 
 
Wow such an innocent baby already suffering at a tender age.  
 
I don't believe all dis crappy lies! What a fabricated story. Well i guess d writer wud be all smiles right now bcos he/she might have  receive huge compensation for this. GOD HELP US.
 
Long story. Davido should also be held liable you can't blame one person in a game meant for two
 
I'm not interested in this bs story go and settle your ish with your babymother. You made your bed so ly in it. Next time use a CONDOM
 
nawaooo!   sophie u r Really a disgrace to motherhood.  but davido u still young for this drama o. settle it out.#kpomkwem#
 
Hmmmmm long buh I read it all...David u hv tried jawe...
 
Hmmmm.....speechless.
 
I just hope all this stops in no time cos this lil baby doesn't need all the negative energy surrounding her ATM. It's just a pity all this is happening. Buh I thought there's something called maternal instincts, how did Miss Sophia not know Cannabis is bad for her baby's health? I mean "pepper lovers" reduce pepper intake cos of breastfeeding let alone hard drugs? Secondly, if all this buying a ticket thing is this serious, why didn't she get herself a ticket from her Dec "allawee"? Well, since this has started in the media, it'd still end here so Linda I'm waiting for more gists.Ivy
 
Dude indeed if na u write this, you need to shut the heck up and think about your role in this. I bet you did not think the girl an worthless POS before you slept with her. Nigg just take care of your biz and stop blabbing shieZe
 
God help this child oh! I knew all along that this girl wanted to milk Davido dry.
 
Linda oohhh this is too long
 
They wan put you on Linda... well, this is quite narrative.. some uncles tho
 
make i hear say i read am
 
my goodness, this is horrible. Davido is too young for all these bullshit. this girl is a very dumb lazy old fool. I'm a mother and I can't bear to see my kids in pain. 
 
Davido sure u are a true fada...Sophia is just like her mum..hmmmmm I reserved my comment..
 
Oh no, I pity this little girl. What future await her with all these negative publicity. Is she safe with the father? 
 
Enter your comment...this is really stories that touch like falz album. #Godblessyoudavid
 
What else, d whole truth has been told. May God help us.
 
This is so so sad! That a young boy of 23 is being manipulated because of his love for his daughter? Haba! Shame on you Mr. Momodu, shaaaaame! So many boys of David's age will run away from such responsibility if if it's proven they fathered the child but David accepted his daughter and has loved her before our own eyes! If y'all want to extort him for this reason, then for real you have shown that you are an Agbaya Mr. Momodu. Once again shame on you! If David were my son or brother, I will insist he leaves Imade for the Momodu's to bring her up, posterity will prove he loved her, it is on the Internet for her to see, if uncle dele does not help Sophie to bring her up well, Sophie will answer to Imade in future. A father, at his young age is trying to give his best to his daughter and one useless uncle is trying to cause chaos in her life. David though I know you can't watch your child suffer or risk losing her but I for say leave Imade for them for a few years make Sophia eyes clear! Rubbish! I dry vex, nobody messes with Davido not when he had fans who will take a bullet for him! Craze ppl. Let's leave trash for Lawma!
 
I pray imade gets well soon. I am not to judge. only God knows d truth. get well soon sweet imade
 
All this stupid Lagos fake big girls and their rubbish life style..the in thing now is to get pregnant for a famous musician so they can fuel their useless lifestyle 
 
O boy d story long..but we still finish am sha..#libnation
 
Na wa oooo
 
Tears Tears.... For the poor Imade. It is well with the Adelekes
 
Mehn dis is 2 long..Davido d lord Will b ur strength...
 
Davido leave that man. It's painful but what can you do? Just keep calm.21 years os not "just" joor.Fear nor catch u sef when you dey sleep with ur obviously older baby mama?
 
PARENTAL ADVISORY^^^Adult Content^^^So I shud read DAT long epistle, becos David said I should....Rubbish
 
Chai this baby don suffer! If the baby needs medical care,then by all means give it to her,even if u hv to pay sophia's plane ticket to tag along! 
 
I really see the truth in the whole drama..its apparent that Davido and his family are best suited to cater for the child...
 
This girl is crazy!, to say the least....1 Million???. Who does she think she is?, what's her workand is she not even ashamed. This is a situation that happens in different levels and spheres of life, in Nigeria.... Women and lies. Mr Davido, if you need one more lawyer on your side, and army will rise for.... This is 'blatant' extortion.... Mr 'momodu' ur own dey ur body.... U should grow up man. Ur niece or cousin, whatever she is, is proud and foolish and shebshould get a life... All that's played out so far shows her irresponsibility and I'm gonna follow this ish to the end... Its now a personal beef for me @ d momodus....u can't do that to the young man... U want to suck his family dry?, obviously hez gat dough and so what?... What was she thinking whenbshe was getting pregnant for a younger person...well so what ? Is it davidos fault?... How aboutbthe young girl here who matters??, the young beautiful daughter and all u care about is a trip to Dubai.... What the momodu family doesn't realize.... If the child dies u all loose, if the child gets depressed and has a messed up childhood, you all loose. How many kids does tu baba have from how many women, how many of them is showing themselves.... Or d beef is DAT davido nor wan marry u????. Get a life girl... Get a life. This is childish.... Well for the record, Annie idibia has done well for herself and Linda please publish my comment cause I'm d new biggest davido right hand man... I've seen this kinda situation before ..... Among very average nigerians , talk much less of those who should be on the high class ranking..  Dis is naija.... If you don't want to work hard and survive.. Den go and... , even the woman that Osho baba told to go and die was working and hussling on the streets of Benin. If u got a case(@her), I didn't bothr to note ur name, u made this public ...  Well justify to Nigerian ....where majority of us are on the poverty line what u need 1 m. A month for , even if its 300 thousand sef,Which school did u finish from, what's ur work...... Gosh...can u imagine
 
What a piece! Let conscience guide all of you in this quagmire or should I say fracas. For the sake of peace bury your hatchets. Please do not compromise the peaceful and lovely growth of this innocent child. Mr. Momodu kindly sheath the two edged VERY BLUNT sword you are brandishing before the Adelekes because it will not even cut the thinnest of skin when struck.
 
Wow I really had to comment on dis Davido u tried buh u meet 2baba 4 advice nw nt tym learn to use a condom 
 
Davido SUE the hell out of dele momodu and his family, stop paying that crazy ass gurl 300k, reduce that shit to 150k a month or 100 self, what the fuck is she doing with that cash. Put her on a written down budget....u hv a clear case here...no mother shud be on any medication or even drug wen breastfeeding
 
Fucking hell this people are mad for attention all his aim is to over shadow that olamides headies ish.....this people just fucking childish I don't rate them all anyway....never wasted my money to go watch some fucking show before....even is they walk past me would never even ask for a picture

Hai Linda this story di mbehuge
 
Make all of take a chill pill
 
hmmmmmmm.....short of words Sisi linda
 
So it's true .nawa o
 
Make all of them take a chill pill 
 
guy I feel ur pains but the mistake has been done just learn form it and retrace your foot step..Imade will get will soonEmjay
 
This is serious. I said it before this Sophia isn't straight in her ways. Too much dreaming, she want to be a BIG GIRL. 
 
If this davido story is true then davido don enter one chance be that.Every man wit his own cross.Na ur own cross be this and only God can deliver.
 
hmmmm. interesting. #lindaitsurboy 
 
how come you are planned a trip with a 7month old without the mother? am waiting for the mother's side of the story 
 
This is a serious matter!
 
Hmmm. Jez pity the little baby and let this rest please. #lobatan!!!
 
This is a serious matter!
 
This is the drama that comes with baby mama.Just take good care of Imade n sort ur issues later.#Hajia Mufliat
 
Hmmm,it is well
 
Its well ooo,am just pitying Imade in all this, d baby must be stressed out from all d tension around her
 
hmmm.... this is serious!
 
congrat ur baby is so cute...Plz invite me to d child dedication I love dat part 
 
Hmmmm na wah ooo who do I believe now?
 
When two people fight d 3rd is to make peace, davido might have done something wrong but dele momodu who is older did more damage but God know d best
 
Hmmm,it is well
 
Wise Child! Well written! Dele Momodu has always looked mean and is mean! Fat frog!Ride on Davido, God has blessed not man can curse, it's only a pity you fell into the wrong hand, wrong girl, wrong in laws! Nice people always meet not-nice people!
 
Hmmm, a detailed one indeed, God will help you through. 
 
Wow. Just wow! I feel sorry for Davido and the innocent baby. 
 
I read only small too long to read! Davido sorry keep calm 
 
Feeling u David.   At least ur daughter will grow up to know u tried ur best. People can be sooo heartless and self centered
 
This is so sad. I feel for Davido. It is obvious Sophia is a gold digger, but unfortunately she misfired. She shld ve gotten pregnant for someone older, like Dbanj or Don Jazzy or Banky. 1m a month plus Benz SUV? Thunder fire u. Stupid ashewo. Nigerian stars shld take this as a wake up call bc there hundreds of Sophia's out there waiting to get pregnant 4 u. They ve learnt it from black Americans, so beware.
 
First we need to hear Sophia's side of the story so that she can explain how her child developed the lungs conditions and why she has stopped breast feeling, otherwise she is just a gold digger who is only interested in her own selfish gain not considering the health of her Baby  !

Davido ozuola,leave dem to God.. He will must be done,not any man's will.. Sorry my Davido
 
I feel u David. At least ur daughter will grow up to know u tried ur best. People can be sooo heartless 
 
Thats how Most family in Nigeria act... D reject u to strugle and when the realise ur succeeding... D now claime d know u and can stand in for u... 
 
Whatever!Take all this to court, the court of law and not public opinion!!! Foolishness all around. This child will grow up and hate both parents at this rate. Nonsense!! when you were creating her no love letter was broadcast to the world.hiss. If the poor child is infected then both parents are to blame. Davido is everywhere smoking all kinds of nonsense with his group, that's another way for a child toinhale 2nd hand smoke. Pls pls pls, it is  a new year. Recieve sense in Jesus name!!!
 
Na wa o!!!
 
Sophie!!!!!! If all these is true then you must really be out of your mind. Who are your friends? Who is your advisor? What is your mum not doing wright? Haaaa I'm ashamed of you,  you better change your ways and become a better person because right now you are a complete disgrace to women and human race in general. Abi iru katikati wo leleyi? Ema gba mi keee
 
Is well...
 
Mr Mamoodu You should apologise to the adelekes  and try to help your so called cousin into rehab. Obviously she gas no parental figures in her life and this is where u and your wife should have stepped in; instead of going to the Internet to raise dust.  Grow up  Dele;  u can still make amends for the innocent child's sake!
 
Jesus! So she actually tested positive to cannabis??? A breastfeeding mum??? I tot it was all made up. Well,David,u ve tried. Al it of mature men sef won't take responsibility of their love child,but u stood up  for ur daughter. Leave Sophia to take her child and lets see how far she goes since all these was because she didn't go to Dubai.  
 
hmmmm. DavidÐ¾ sounds truthful especially with the medical reports and pics.
 
May God give u the grace to completely ignore your detractors and remain focus.... No one would have come calling if u were a shoe shiner..
 
Hhhhmmm, this is serious wo. I pray u settle ur difference 4 d sake of d baby. 
 
I doff my cap for the English graduate student that was hired to write this epistle.Hungry writers please continue to camp at this boy's gate. This kind of grammar has never escaped his mouth in life -"offing" indeed!!! lwkmd. 
 
The second picture brought tears to my eyes. The poor baby...
 
Chai! Can't read this oo...infact am in church#lindaThumbsUp 
 
Speechless, 
 
Hmmm am so proud of you little daddy davido,here comes a small boy wanting to be responsible and d older ones want to spoil his name,please don't give up ur reward is in heaven and to Sophia just be grateful to God for d angel he sent to u, my ex close to four year has paid fees and even sent me one naira to feed his kids yet u allow people use ur dump head not to give ur baby d best hmmm if I were u I will go and kneel down and beg d family and get a life,humble ur self and see if d guy will consider u,because u have more to gain and noting to loose why go to club 'give u sweet girl that God gave u d best, instead use d money for clubs rather enroll for a professional handwork girl,ur name shld not be in d papers in such a bad manner,and don't depend on any man! Cannibabis positive Shame really!but please davido please for d sake of that beautiful child imade please help d mother enrol her to go further in her studies,please and for oga dele why now enh don't complicate issues for d girl adjsut her life either:seriously am still in shock how such a young boy will be so responsible like this may God bless u davido and family for ur daddy davido na better person may u leave long daddy kai u try,God bless ur sister for help out and linda keep d fire burning pretty you God bless u all
 
Well, well, well... it is well. but ds results ain't dat of Imade Adeleke. It's of Sophie Momodu
 
If davido wrote this himself his dad didn't waste money on his education if not kudos to the person who wrote it. 
 
Oh WOW! just WOW
 
oh my!!!  i dont just know what to say.  God please guide and protect baby Imade. 
 
Eeyah! Too too bad. Davido mabinu, may God keep u and ur daughter 
 
In all, i'd still blame  Davido for allowing all of these at d first place. And secondly, i'll forever fault a scenario whereby an older lady sleeps with a man much younger than she is for any reason whatsoever, where's d sense in that? U guys should settle amicably pls coz you're both very irresponsible.....
 
Wow! Am   speechless! I just praay dat. God gives d. Lil princess gooddd health!  
 
somepeople wound easily blame davido because he is a celeb and from a wealthy home but i have a deep feeling here that davido is telling the truth and the davido i no....to have maintained his cool just because of the love for imade and even the way the car issue kept repeating itself from solphia and dele momodu self publication online vindicated davido afterraw and placing material things over your own child and that to me is LACK OF CARE because as the mother you can change overnite to a saint so as to weep public sentiment and davido you are a man and never wasnt a true fan  but from this moment i am your true fan 
 
Usless girl unless momodu...davido much love to u and your daughterThis is what cossy should be doing...donating her milk...~Make I go drink one bottle of beer~
 
Dis story sud jst die abeg.am tired of hearing dis noise from dis family nd also dis am jst 21 or 23.at 19 I already know my right nd wrong so biko it's ok
 
Eeyah! Too too bad. Davido mabinu, may God keep you and ur daughter 
 
Slow to judge.
 
The whole attention has been on olamide and don jazzy ,this punk will do anything to be on the news including using his poor child .Useless fellow .

Jungwirth's family have not said much to the media, but reports suggest that she has their full support. Tomlinson's mother, Johannah, is also expected to arrive in the United States a few days before the baby is delivered. The 1D mom said earlier last year that she is excited to see her grandchild and she has reportedly given some advice to Jungwirth as she goes through the rough times of pregnancy.

The blonde beauty, who briefly dated baby daddy Louis Tomlinson in 2015, welcomed son Freddie Reign on January 21. Apart from one picture at the hospital, Briana hasn't posted any pictures of the tot since he first showed his face. However that all changed when the LA-based stylist shared a snap with her 289,000 followers on Instagram on Sunday.  






 



 The black and white image featured baby Freddie grabbing his mum's finger while the pair bonded together on Valentine's Day. In the caption, she wrote: "couldn't have asked for a better valentine."

Weâll just let you decide if this photo is legit. beyond grateful for such a beautiful day A photo posted by Briana Jungwirth (@brianaashleyjungwirth) on Dec 25, 2015 at 9:14pm PST In other Louis-related news, it appears he shelled out a pretty penny so his rumored current girlfriend, Danielle Campbell, could fly her beloved pooch Max from London to Chicago in a private jet. Campbell was reportedly concerned Max might get sick in the Alps.

The R&B singer and his new girlfriend Daphne Joy were spotted showing some PDA at the LAX yesterday. Derulo and Joy have been linked for months now but the singer denied the reports in the past. TMZ posted a video of the two hugging each other tight as they make their way through LAX. The pair were returning from a vacation in Miami together. Back in November Daphne Joy vigorously denied that she is dating the singer.

												 Married drug lord âEl Chapoâ might have the hots for sultry star Kate del Castillo â but he apparently spent New Yearâs Eve with a 26-year-old politician with whom he has a child, according to a report. Joaquin Guzman spent Christmas with his wife, American-born stunner Emma Coronel, in Mocorito before spending New Yearâs Eve with Lucero Guadalupe Sanchez, a member of the Sinaloa Congress, in Guamuchil, Central European News reports. Sanchez also visited the Mexican coke kingpin in the Altiplano slammer in May when she was pregnant, according to the report. Prison officials had complained to the attorney general that El Chapo was visited by a woman who used a fake ID. Sanchez has denied being the woman seen on surveillance video. The newspaper Excelsior reported last year that Sanchez first met El Chapo during a 2013 party. A few months later, her former husband and the father of her two sons, Ruben Chavez, 27, was fatally shot. One of the diminutive drug lordâs attorneys confirmed in a statement leaked by the attorney generalâs office in Mexico shortly after his second escape from a high-security prison that Sanchez visited El Chapo to discuss where and how their kid would be raised. Del Castillo won El Chapoâs trust â and heart â and set up the controversial interview with Sean Penn that ultimately led to his Jan. 8 capture.

Daily Trust (Abuja)
 Lagos â Controversies between the popular hip hop act David Adeleke, popularly known as "Davido", and his estranged baby mother, Sophia Momodu over alleged trafficking of their seven-month-old baby, Imade Adeleke, get messier on Tuesday as Davido releases to public domain, alleged medical report confirming that Sophia is a chain smoker of cannabis. It would be recalled that Sophia had challenged the popular artiste and his family to publish the medical report claiming she has cannabis in her blood to prove the allegation of taking her baby away from her custody. But in a series of counter messages on his instagram on Tuesday, Davido narrated how Sophia allegedly "trapped" her with the pregnancy when it is in its second trimester of Sophia's pregnancy was closing. He said the baby was in Sophia's custody for two months until she got severely sick and Adeleke's family had to intervene. "Imade was in her custody for 2 straight months, unchallenged and uninterrupted, until the baby took badly and severely ill in July. Imade cried, ceaselessly, for 48 hours. She was rushed to the hospital where her condition confounded medical experts. Several tests were conducted on her and later on the mother. "Medical reports, herein attached (exhibit 1), proved that Sophia's blood was polluted to the maximum level with cannabis and she had by the process of breast feeding infected her child with complicated medical conditions associated with the use of alcohol and especially cannabis. The trouble spot for made was her lungs. She had difficulty breathing largely because of the contaminated breast milk and the severity of the "Second Smoke" of marijuana inhaled by the poor child. "The medical experts at the hospital were enraged by the callous treatment of Imade by her own mother and declared her unfit for the caring and the nursing of a delicate baby. The team determined that they would hand over the baby to the Children's Welfare Authority of Lagos State Government. Alleged medical report My family started to plead with the hospital management. For the first time, Sophia too was sober, sorry and contrite. We pleaded that the baby would be kept from the mother once she was returned to us, and that we would take over responsibilities for Imade's welfare," Davido writes. However, Sophia's uncle who is also the publisher of Ovation Magazine, Dele Momodu in messages on his instagram condemned the alleged medical report, saying it was "an attack on a defenseless lady who merely asked that she be allowed to enjoy the fruit of motherhood". "Even a Laboratory result alleging she's a cannabis smoker was splashed everywhere. She was said to have infected her own baby with cannabis. The vicious authors expected some gullible people to believe them. Nothing could have been cruelest. Our initial reaction was to maintain the ceasefire but this latest attack against a defenseless lady who merely asked that she be allowed to enjoy the fruit of motherhood was the limit of recklessness and rascality," Momodu Copyright Â© 2016 Daily Trust.

That part of the interview started around the 2:30 minute mark  Seems Masika Kalysha didnât take his statement too likely and went on a Twitter rant. She is basically saying that he was the one who purposely got her pregnant. âThat b**ch was better of keeping his mouth shut. No real man speaks negative about the woman he got pregnant on purpose against her will,â she tweeted.  Men lie, women lie but these text messages don't lie ? I've been so quiet and so humble concentrating on being a good motherâ¦ Butâ¦ â masika kalysha (@masikakalysha) January 6, 2016  Anyways let me get back to being the strong, independent beautiful pregnant woman I am with no help from my childs father ? #pregnantinpumps â masika kalysha (@masikakalysha) January 6, 2016  I've kept quietâ¦ For 1 reason.

He ejaculated inside herâ¦she has it right. What a crazy environment for a child to be born into. She knew for sure he was not wearing any protection and didnât seem to have a problem with him not protecting him self. She acted as if she very much welcome his carelessness. So i would say he right. Not the she know I wasnât wearing protection, so I had to put it somewhere defense. Letâs see how ârightâ he is when she takes him to court for child support.

The news of his hospital admission comes after the 23-year-old was accused by Sophia Momodu, his baby mama of kidnapping their seven-month-old daughter, Imade Adeleke. Since the past week, the news has turned into a full blown scandal with both parties throwing allegations at each other. While Davido accuses his daughterâs mother of being irresponsible, Sophia Momodu and her uncle, media entrepreneur, Dele Momodu, are saying Davido and his family of trying to use their wealth to take the baby away from her mother.

 The Nigerian entertainment industry is looking set to have a magical year in respect to celebrity dramas and the media buzz in the wake of this. It remains to be seen where this leads us to in 2016.  Davido and baby Imade Credit: Instagram From the face-off between Freeze and Basketmouth in late December, 2015 to Olamide and Don Jazzy at the Headies which held on January 1, 2016, the fans and critics are sure having a swell time going back and forth with claims and counterclaims. It has been interesting so far. READ ALSO:Â Aftermath Of The Olamide And Don Jazzy âBeefâ But in spite of all that has happened recently with celebrities and the dramas revolving around them, nothing has been quite as big and as lasting as the current scuffle between Davido, Sophia Momodu (his âbaby mamaâ) and her uncle Dele Momodu. And as we wake up to newer revelations with each passing day, below are 10 lessons we can draw so far from the ensuing drama: 1. Davido was unhappy about Sophiaâs pregnancy as he clearly didnât expect a child with her â According to him, on learning that Sophie was pregnant for him, his mind was bemused and his soul confused. He however said he accepted his responsibility for the sad misadventure that put him on a flight with her, a flight headed nowhere. 2. There is no love lost between Davido Adeleke and Dele Momodu â Dele Momodu has come out to say Sophie was âcomprehensively scandalizedâ. In a statement released on January 4, the Ovation publisher said details circulating in the media of his cousin being a cannabis smoker is so bad ânothing could have been cruelestâ. 3. Baby Imade was allegedly âforcefullyâ taken away from her mum on July 11, 2015 â Contrary to claims that baby Imade was to be taken abroad for treatment, Mr. Momodu says this has been an unwarranted fabrication of endless lies to justify the act of forcefully taking a baby from her biological mother. Momodu claims the baby had been âforcefully separatedâ from her mother at only two months old, and there were pleas for months for her to be returned to her biological mother but all Sophia got was the opportunity to visit her daughter once a week, specifically on Sundays. 4. Claims that Imade was unwell might be untrue â This is because when Imade was taken abroad for alleged treatments, she had in fact being with her aunt, Ashley Adeleke (Davidoâs sister), in Dubai as they were both swimming in the pool of Atlantis, The Palm Dubai, a luxury resort. Ashley Adeleke abd baby Imade in Dubai. Credit: Instagram 5. Sophia Momodu might not be the defenseless, poor mother after all â Contrary to Mr. Momoduâs report that Sophia was a defenseless lady who had been unfairly treated; there are revelations that she is a party lover and a lavish spender who contributes nothing to vast expenses incurred. In addition, no one from her family, including her uncle Dele Momodu, contributed even a coin to the expenses at the time. Davido claims the entire burden of medical bills, feeding, transportation and sundry expenses were handled by him. 6. There might be more to this from the Momodu family than we know â There are possibilities there is more to the relationship within the Momodu family than we currently know or read about. Davido claims while things were rosy between him and Sophia, she revealed some details to him about her uncle Dele Momodu that he doesnât want to divulge. 7. Sophia Momodu might have employed âdiabolicalâ means along the line â Davido claims he opened his doors to Sophia even when he was uncertain it was his baby she was carrying. It was after May 14, 2015 when the baby had been born that DNA results confirmed his status as father. Also, according to him she was a drifter without a relative to assist her in Lagos which led her to moving in with the Afro pop star. He alleged she took advantage of his poor judgment, using a cunning sense and vicious diabolical support to try and make him a victim. 8. The Momodu family might have been jealous all along â Reports from Davidoâs camp allege Mr. and Mrs. Momodu are showing a fake love towards Sophia especially because she had a baby for a fairly prominent family. He also claims they are jealous of the fact that she ever became a mum and do not wish the little baby the best things. 9. Mr and Mrs Momodu are crowding Davidoâs space â The singer alleged this because upon first meeting Sophia and all through when they were together, she never formally introduced any of them to him which makes him wonder why an absentee uncle has any traction on the moral authority commanding the affairs as it is. READ ALSO:Â Dele Momodu Is Not Being Truthful, If Anything Happens To My Daughter He Is Responsible â Davido 10. Sophia Momodu was never reportedly unprepared for motherhood â The singer claimed to have provided her a monthly allowance of N300, 000 in addition to utility bills. He also fully paid a two-year rent for her apartment but she left the house in no time in search of the glitzy night life in Lagos, leaving her baby behind.  Naij.com Home Page Think it is important?

Nia Guzman is reportedly furious with Chris Brown and filed legal documents to restrict the singer's visitation with their daughter, Royalty. Guzman's frustrations reportedly stem from Brown's alleged smoking around the 1-year-old child. TMZ reports that Guzman has asked a judge to order the "Liquor" singer to submit to random drug testing and prohibit him from smoking or drinking alcohol when he's with their daughter. Guzman claims that the infant has developed asthma, and she believes it's because Brown allegedly smokes weed and cigarettes when Royalty is with him. She also fears that Brown has relapsed and startedÂ doingÂ "sizzurp,"Â a concoction made with cough syrup and used as a recreational drug, again. According to the outlet, Guzman also says that whenever Royalty returns from visiting the 26-year-old pop star, her clothes smell like smoke. She wants the judge to either make Brown hire a full-time nanny or wants the singer to have less time with his daughter. In addition, Guzman also wants $16,000 a month in child support. Brown currently gives her $2,500. According to The Shade Room, Brown responded to Guzmanâs claims on Instagram,Â writing that he and his friends have never smoked around his daughter. âThis is obviously a play to get some sort of increased income,â Brown wrote in a since-deleted post. âI take care of my daughter, and I would never ever put her in a position that will harm her. Iâm so sick and tired of negative people trying to use me and slander me â¦ My daughter is my pride and joy, and I will not be played because my lifestyle is different from the other parities [sic] involved. This really has to stop.â The "Loyal" singer also posted a cryptic message about the struggles of being an adult. A photo posted by @chrisbrownofficial on Jan 30, 2016 at 6:36pm PST Â  In December, Brown dished on co-parenting and raising his daughter, telling "On Air With Ryan Seacrest" that he wanted to give up smoking because of Royalty. âOne habit Iâm quitting for the New Yearâs resolution is definitely smoking cigarettes,â he said. âFor my daughter to be a light in the my life, I think this is something I need to get rid of.âÂ  Brown and Guzman spent the beginning of last year battling each other in court over their custody arrangement. The pair finally agreed to co-parent and share custody in October 2015. The IBT Pulse Newsletter keeps you connected to the biggest stories unfolding in the global economy.
