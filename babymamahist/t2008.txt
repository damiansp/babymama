 Manufactured Liberal Outrage: Obama’s Baby Mama Trackbacks/Pingbacks Pages Live Traffic The Code The Author Ye Olde Adverts Categories Calendar Favorite Posts Meta Swag My Host Today’s liberal freakout: Salon: Fox News calls Michelle Obama “Obama’s baby mama” An alert reader wrote in just a little while ago to let us know about something he’d spotted on Fox News Wednesday afternoon. During a segment discussing conservative attacks against Michelle Obama, the wife of presumptive Democratic nominee Barack Obama, the network described the former as “Obama’s baby mama.” They’ve even got screenshots and video. Oooooh! In full, it says “OUTRAGED LIBERALS: STOP PICKING ON OBAMA’S BABY MAMA!” It was featured in the bottom news scroller.  Well, if Obama and his little America hating mama want to be all hip and fist bump…… Not to self: stop reading the quote, hard to finish post when ROTFLOL. Oliver Willis (who finally has a better header graphic), is in complete freakout mode: Hey Fox News, Just Call Her A N***** And Be Done With It, Okay? According to some white guy at Shakesville, this is racist. Tomorrow, I assume Fox will put up a graphic, “Obama downs a 40 of malt liquor, and shoots cop in drive-by.” Yawn.  It’s an irony alert at Pandagon, who feature an Obama monkey doll, probably made by liberals. Check the header: there is an Obama logo, and next to it a caption that says “It’s a jungle out there.” I find that highly offensive and racists! BTW, the post of the Pandagon post is “Watch Out For That Tree.”  Doesn’t that seem racist? Or, am I reading too much in to it? And the freakout could continue on and on. See more at Memeorandum. Michelle Malkin, who was on Fox News during the time the scroll bar featured the current liberal manufactured outrage, points out that it was Michelle Obama herself who referred to BhO as her “babies daddy,” and has used it many times. Those lovely progressive have gone on to send Michelle all sorts of *SURPRISE* hatefull, racist emails! Is there any point in checking the Interwebz and posting a few of the disgusting and hateful things that have been printed and published about W, Laura B., Darth Cheney, etc? How about just one, as most of y’all already have heard it all: “The presidency of George W. Bush has now devolved into a criminal conspiracyto cover the ass of George W. Bush,” Keith Olbermann began. And let’s not forget all the pleasant things at the Huffington Post, which is an official stringer for the AP, is considered a news source at Google and Yahoo News, and is featured in many mainstream newspapers. I swear, I did not read James Joyner’s post at Outside The Beltway before writing this. He catches something else funny at Oliver WIllis’. More: Sister Toldjah writes: The far left is in the midst of having a coronary. Indeed! Wake Up America: There is massive outrage rippling across the Internet right now… The good news is, they will find some other massive freakout tomorrow. This is rich: The Mahablog decries the use of slurs, yet titles the post Who Needs Satire When You’ve Got Wingnuts?, and then goes on to slur Michelle M. by calling her Little Lulu. In the first showing of Little Lulu, she was throwing banana peels in a wedding aisle. Is Mahablog calling Michele M. a monkey? The Moderate Voice sure reads like anything but a moderate, though certainly less unhinged then other progressives. The Leather Penguin picks up on the latest Excitable “I’m THE Conservative, damnitall!”” Andy freakout on this MLOA (Manufactured Liberal Outrage Alert) A thought: If the term “baby mama” denotes illegitimacy, then why did Michelle Obama use it? Did she mean that her kids are illegitimate?

 It’s not outrage, dear. It’s laughter. That Michelle Malkin video with “Obama’s Baby Mama” scrolling under it is pure self-satire. We liberals are getting a good chuckle out of it. You wingnuts have no sense of humor. No maha, dear, it’s all about outrage at Ollie’s place. I read all of the post and comments at Oliver Willis’ site today…and if you think all you liberals are full of chuckles, satire, and humor over this, you must be carrying around some mice in your pocket. Wasn’t Michelle Malkin the one who got upset over a scarf in a Dunkin’ Donuts ad?  Seriously – you can’t make this stuff up. Y’all sure aren’t showing the humor today, maha, you have to admit that. That one at Olliver’s spot blew my mind. That was extreme, even for him. And that has what to do with the price of beer, Silke? Malkin didn’t do it. She had nothing to do with the scroller. Malkin manufactures outrage about a scarf and you see nothing wrong with it.  It’s only when the Left does it that you comment.  Interesting. But Obama bin Laden said that babies are a problem for his daughters? And Michelle is supposed to be a black Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy? Who are these lunes? Why don’t we ask Malkin to check with Heraldo? Sorry, the comment form is closed at this time.  Pirate's Cove

Closing the Curtain on the Baby Mama Daddy Drama Syndrome  


				  Eric Legette

Jamestown, NC (BlackNews.com) - False allegations of abuse or neglect, legal fees, family court cases, investigations from child welfare, domestic violence - all these things and much more are the consequences of the “drama” that is presently affecting countless numbers of separated and divorced fathers and mothers.  For single people, having sex too soon, ignoring warning signals and failing to have a plan in dating can quickly usher single people into the “drama” community. 
 For over a decade, Eric Legette, President/Founder of Fathers With Voices has assisted countless numbers of primarily separated and divorced fathers impacted by the drama.  His own experiences within and outside of family court as he advocated for the right to remain in his daughters’ life led him to write Closing the Curtain on Baby Mama Drama: A Guide For Fathers Fighting For Their Children Inside and Outside of Family Court (Barnes and Noble.com).  The book offers valuable information and insight on issues that poses a direct threat to relationships between fathers and their children after a separation and divorce.  Mr. Legette provides insight for fathers on such issues as:


* The importance of educating yourself in family law
* Coping mechanisms to deal with the stress
* Ten examples of “Baby Mama Drama” and the solutions
* The reasons men should fight for their children

 Based on conversations Mr. Legette had with both fathers and mothers impacted by the “drama”, he learned that single people are also at risk of becoming part of this significant social phenomenon which ultimately led to the writing of the e-book The Singles Guide: How to Avoid Baby Mama-Daddy Drama Relationships (www.fatherswithvoices.info).


Within this book he is providing for single people an up close view on the damaging affects the drama has on individuals financially, legally and emotionally.  He is also informing single people of the same mistakes parents within the drama have made, they too maybe making the same mistakes as they are seeking a mate.  Mr. Legette provides insight on:


* Defining the Drama
* How to conduct a dating interview (To avoid becoming part of the drama)
* What is BMDDS (Baby Mama-Daddy Syndrome) and how does it affect your dating decisions?
* The four high risk forms of dating


Both books are designed to address and provide effective ways to confront and avoid this horrific social problem that is negatively impacting the lives of so many people today.  Mr. Legette truly believes the power of the drama is not so powerful that the curtains cannot at some point be closed!

  Based on conversations Mr. Legette had with both fathers and mothers impacted by the “drama”, he learned that single people are also at risk of becoming part of this significant social phenomenon which ultimately led to the writing of the e-book The Singles Guide: How to Avoid Baby Mama-Daddy Drama Relationships (www.fatherswithvoices.info).


Within this book he is providing for single people an up close view on the damaging affects the drama has on individuals financially, legally and emotionally.  He is also informing single people of the same mistakes parents within the drama have made, they too maybe making the same mistakes as they are seeking a mate.  Mr. Legette provides insight on:


* Defining the Drama
* How to conduct a dating interview (To avoid becoming part of the drama)
* What is BMDDS (Baby Mama-Daddy Syndrome) and how does it affect your dating decisions?
* The four high risk forms of dating


Both books are designed to address and provide effective ways to confront and avoid this horrific social problem that is negatively impacting the lives of so many people today.  Mr. Legette truly believes the power of the drama is not so powerful that the curtains cannot at some point be closed!

  Urlacher Baby Mama Drama Continues Other Interesting Stories send a tip Newsletter Istaverse contribute About all our citiesone convenient app The Joliet Herald-News reports this morning that Brian Urlacher's baby mama, Tyra Robertson, has filed a claim in Will County court that states that Urlacher's son, Kennedy, has taken to wearing pink diapers and wearing blue nail polish on his toes.  We're not sure exactly where in the penal code this counts as child abuse, but it gets better - Robertson seems to believe that this is reason enough to keep Brian from seeing his kid.  Can someone get Jeffrey Leving on the phone?  Brian needs some Father's Rights representation, stat. Robertson and Urlacher's lawyers have been wrangling back and forth to keep little Kennedy's visitation for Brian, and Robertson's lawyer said that Tyra "would allow the visitation, so long as Urlacher put away the Bears-blue nail polish and diapered their son in gender appropriate pull-ups."   If the story is indeed true - and the presence of a photo of painted nails on the Sun-Times site indicates it is - we'd like to take back all the negative things we've ever said about Brian Urlacher.  If he wants to teach his kid that there are no such thing as gender roles, then more power to him.  As long as none of it is actually hurting the child, then who gives a shit if he puts on nail polish and pink diapers?  (Although it might have been a slightly better idea to alternate with blue and orange, Brian.  Just a thought.) If Kennedy Urlacher was Brian's daughter instead of his son, would we be hearing stories about camouflaged diapers and playing with GI Joes?  If Urlacher's daughter started cover-2 plays as a defensive end at the local playlot, would there be legal paperwork filed about that?  We doubt it. Go get 'em, Kennedy.  Wear whatever you want.  Be a creative little 3-year-old.  The world will pummel it out of you eventually, so live a little bit when you're young.  When you're a sophomore in high school and everyone expects you to be kicking ass on the Junior Varisty team, you'll look back on this freedom and be glad your dad let you have a little fun.  We've got your back.  Just don't turn into a spoiled little brat later on because your dad let you get away with a few things.  And hang onto this link, just in case.  Got it?

Food for thought(kinda sorta) Call HamptonRoads.com & PilotOnline.com How to be civil in comments: So the other week the rumor swirled that Erykah Badu was pregs with her third child by her new love Jay Electronica (who, I have to admit, is totally benefitng from this attention). In the next e-breaths everybody was like, 'Sheesh -- that's three babies by three different guys.' (Badu has a boy, with Andre 3000 and a girl with The D.O.C.) As much as I love Badu, I did ask myself. 'I mean, has she heard of birth control?' What kind of role model is she to young girls? After mentally wagging my fingers and getting sanctimonious and judgemental though I thought, 'Wait, why did you assume it was an accident? What if she wanted it that way? And anyway, what does her birth canal have to do with me?' Artists, as we know, have unorthodox ways of looking at things. So Badu, apparently having heard all the furor about her very busy womb, has shot back online. You can read the full rant here, but here are some of the highlights: peace,
HOW DARE YOU DISRESPECT THE QUEENDOM 
...AND MY CHILDREN AND MY INTELLIGENCE... i am a great mother and care giver to my 2 children and to this world .
I home schooled them and taught them the ways of good to the best of my ability.
i am their doctor and their nurse .
and even sometimes their mother and their father. i am an excellent mother...I PUT MUCH TIME AND THOUGHT INTO HAVING AND RAISING MY CHILDREN. 
IVE HAD THE HONORS OF HAVING 2 HOME BIRTHS AND 2 WONDERFUL PARTNERS BY MY SIDE. every relationship i have been in was because i loved the person DEARLY and was dedicated to us "exclusively" FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. the fathers of my children are my brothers and friends . we have a great deal of respect for one another and always will. WE LOVE OUR CHILDREN TO NO END. 
we took our own "vows" and CONTINUE TO UPHOLD THEM.
AND THAT IS WHAT THAT IS . question?
WHAT IS MARRIAGE ? 
WHO IS THE JUDGE? WOULD IT "LOOK BETTER " TO MARRY AND DIVIORCE AND MARRY AGAIN ? WOULD THAT BE MORALLY CORRECT ? WHATS THE DIFFERENCE ? the government's involvement i guess. IDEALLY , IT WOULD BE EXCELLENT TO FIND THE MAN OR WOMAN WHO FULFILLS YOUR SPIRIT AND STAY FOR EVER AND EVER ( thru sickness and health till death do us part ) AND HAVE HEALTHY STRONG CHILDREN AS A RESULT OF A HEALTHY AND STRONG UNION. (this CAN happen ... we need much training , however.) OR  IS IT REALLY "GOOD" TO STAY IN A RELATIONSHIP WHERE BOTH PARTIES ARE UNFULFILLED , LONGING FOR RELIEF , BRINGING one another down as a result of improper training , creating BAD ENERGY AND EXPERIENCES FOR THE CHILD TO REPEAT ?
(not to mention breeding deceit and anger and resentment ) SEEMS TO CREATE FEARFUL CHILDREN WHO TURN INTO FEARFUL ADULTS . HOW MANY OF YOU GREW UP IN 2 PARENT HOMES THAT WERE MISERABLE... HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE A SIBLING THAT HAS A DIFFERENT FATHER OR MOTHER? DOES HE OR SHE MEAN LESS TO YOU? HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE MORE THAN 1 MOTHER OR FATHER OF YOUR OWN CHILDren ? how about this: I PRAY WITH MY CHILDREN I FEED THEM GOOD FOOD THEY RESPECT PEOPLES DIFFERENCES THEY TRAVEL THE WORLD WITH ME THE KNOW WHO THEY ARE THEY ADORE THEIR FATHERS AND ARE LOVED BY 2 PARENTS OR MORE - OR TWO OR MORE SETS OF LOVING GRANDPARENTS THEY CRY THEY GET HURT THEY GET SICK THEY HEAL THEY ARE real THEY ARE NOT AN IDEA or a TOPIC AND NEITHER AM I . I AM ALIVE . I AM BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. I AM A GOOD WOMAM. I AM GROWING I AM COMPLETE WITH OR WITHOUT A PARTNER AND WILL ALWAYS BE AND I HAVE DREAMS OF A FAMILY STRUCTURE ALL OF MY DREAMS DO NOT COME TRUE WE ARE THEIR CHAMPIONS . live how you want . follow which ever pattern YOU like . MY CHILDREN WILL BE LEADERS and they will not ever be slaves to this society's failing idea of morality. THEY OWN THEIR MINDS AND THEIR DREAMS. your opinions lack experience and are not only careless but also very uninformed and immature. if i lose you as a fan because i want to continue to have children then  WHO NEEDS YOU ....CERTAINLY NOT ME ... KICK ROCKS ... CALL TYRONE ... PACK LIGHT .... BITE ME and if this post is not clear kiss my placenta. * So I guess she's pregnant then, huh? But I'm sorry, this line from Idolator is too funny: ...spectacular rant that invites anyone who would like to further question her to kiss her placenta after, presumably, forming a line to the left and waiting for a while. Anyway, thoughts? Bad role model or just sign of the times? Please enable JavaScript to see comments. Don't get me wrong I am truly an EB fan.  She is one of my favorites.  When I first read on one of the gossip websites that she was expecting, by a 3rd father, the undercover conservative in me took pause (oh no she didn't, lol).  After reflecting, I came to the conclusion that she is who she is...a free spirit who lives her life, loves her life and and all of the forces that are in play in her life.
ALL of us have taken actions that may have caused others to do a double take...However, who are we to judge??? Besides, we don't know her LIKE THAT!! I was glad to see her post, as hilarious as it was in parts. She makes some very very very ...very very valid points,lol. She better call Tyrone  ohnotheydidnt  Oh no they didn't!The celebrities are disposable. The gossip is priceless.

Really? Archived Entry 63 Responses to “Logic: So, did 50 Cent burn his house down and try to kill his ex? Really?” Leave a Reply Fri 30 May 2008 Up until now, this ongoing legal battle between 50 Cent and his son’s mother Shaniqua Tompkins has been shocking, if not entertaining, and distasteful. She sued him for $50k a month, up from the $25k she was getting. Instead a judge awarded her $6700 a month, and told her to leave 50’s $1.4 million Long Island mansion. Along with 50’s son Marquise, Tompkins also has a teenage daughter as well as a live-in boyfriend. But the judge’s order has not made for a smooth relocation, more litigation has been set into motion, eviction deadlines loom, and, of course, a war of words has been aired out in the media.  But when kids are caught up in a burning house, and fire marshalls suspect arson…this whole family dispute is no longer the slightest bit salacious or juicy. I’m noticing alot of interesting allegations, some anonymous, showing up on TMZ. Including, a disturbing rant by Shaniqua Thompkins herself, claiming, “Yes  think he would, he’s obsessed. If he can’t have me than no one can. He’s obsessed….yes, we’re in litigation, we’re fighting over the house. [50] said he was gonna have someone come kill me and watch what he does. And this is what he did. [So he threatened you?] Yes!” (Click here to watch the video) On Monday, a cameraphone caught 50 Cent and Tompkins making a scene outside of a lawyers office in Long Island, after a deposition session. They were seen yelling at each other in the street. 50 is physically urged into his truck. Meanwhile, Shaniqua’s boyfriend stands and watches with his friends. What could they have been yelling about? Perhaps something ugly had just taken place….  An “source” claimed to TMZ that 50’s crew trashed Shaniqua’s lawyers office on Monday. Would that be at the time of this deposition and public spectacle? Hmm…Maybe it has something to do with this… From the Associated Press: Tompkins’ lawyer, Paul Catsandonis, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that the dispute over the house had become “extremely, extremely contentious” in recent days. Although he declined to be specific, he said there was an “extremely dangerous incident” Monday in his Manhattan office while taking a deposition for the lawsuit. The dispute was “involving the parties in question,” he said. Shaniqua’s lawyer also told TMZ that before the firetrucks were called to the burning house at 5am today, Shaniqua heard someone entering her home at 3am. Scary! Wonder why police weren’t called to investigate the break-in? And since the consensus around the snarkosphere has been that fif has gon’ crazy and tried to kill his baby mom, her new man, 2 children, 2 other innocent people, and burn up his own house…..I just have to say…as erratic and irrational as rappers often are….I just dont know if I buy it. Click more to continue  If it’s about the house, the judge has already awarded the house to 50. He would be free to sell it in a month. Houses are usually worth less when delivered in ash. If 50 hired some mercenary to burn the house, I would think that his own son being subjected to smoke inhalation…would be a dealbreaker. And as for the whole “if he can’t have me, nobody can” thing…..um…well, I guess. A statement from 50’s rep reads: “Informed this morning while filming a new motion picture on location in Louisiana, Curtis Jackson expressed deep concern over this fire at his property. He is extremely thankful that everyone including his son, Marquise, escaped the burning house safely. He is confident that authorities will be conducting a thorough investigation of the incident and is eager to review their findings.” Here is the AP‘s description of the scene at the fire…. Police said the victims included the rapper’s former girlfriend Shaniqua Tompkins and two of her children, including a son fathered by 50 Cent named Marquise. Three other adults in the home weren’t immediately identified. A passing off-duty police officer helped rescue the six people off an elevated deck in the home’s backyard, Feld said. Why would 4 adults all rush with 2 kids in tow, to a porch instead of out a door? I guess the layout of the house is key in making sense of this, but they must have all been coming from different parts of the house, so why would everyone end up there?  Damn. I wouldn’t have thought fif would have harmed his son. So I dont think he had nothin to do with it. Reply this trick really thinks she is cute….if he can’t have her no one else will !!!! please you are obsessed with his money and mad that he won’t give you any. i believe her boyfriend kand her planned this fire. he was not in the house at the time. it was reported she had to be out by tomorrow. so what other gift would she give 50….i don’t believe 50 had any thing to do with this….now if his son was not in the house during that time i may have considered maybe, but he won’t not put his son’s life in jeopardy. she knew she was losing and was angry. she is trying to make it seem like he wanted to kill her, ok he may have said it in anger , we all have at one time or other, but he has too much to lose behing this trick….enought said…..oh am i FIRST!!?? Reply 50 really has no motive to burn down the house since they were ordered to leave by the end of the school year (june). Also, that whole breakin part sounds very fishy since nothing is mentioned about police coming to check it out. As for killing her, I doubt he would have that done. He wouldn’t risk his whole life and freedom to kill somebody who he already has such an upper hand on. Also, 50 is (or has been) hesitant to even talk shit about her for fear of his son holding it against him so I seriously doubt he would go as far as to kill her. I’m not saying he didn’t say it(because people say shit in anger all the time that they don’t mean), but I think its clear to see he wouldn’t do it. Reply RUN CIARA RUN Reply This whole thing is fishy on some Left-Eye type shit. I dunno Info. I don’t believe Fif would burn down a house with this son in it and all.  That girl is lying; either she did that shit, or she got someone to do it themselves. This is worse than that whole Dame Dash baby mama drama that’s been going on for as long as I can remember. Reply I think the baby mama did cuz she cant live there any more. why would fif burn his own crib he was getting it back anyway. Reply I think this might be a setup… I’m not a big 50 fan, but I truly believe the dude is too smart to try and throw his life (and millions) and child away over some bs with his baby mama… Just like u said, if she thought someone was tryin to break into her house at 3am why didn’t she call the police… especially after he allegedly threatened her life. Plus the way she is jumpin all over the news sayin he did it is just a lil too “Lady doth protest too much” for me… ONly thing I’ll give her is that 50 does seem arrogant enough to where I could see him thinkin he could do some shit like that and get away with it… Either way I’m almost sure this wasn’t an accident… Reply Is there any doubt Shan’s birdbrain azz did this? I hope 50 can get full custody of his son after she has clearly endangered him with this nonsense. The sane train has quite clearly pulled out the station and left Shan’s bird azz behind. Reply Oh and I gotta add….Shan so played herself with that whole, fif said if I cant have you nobody can BS.  I doubt fif EVER said that ish to her. Puhleeze. She is definitely in meltdown mode. Chick is dangerous for sure. Reply *yawn* number 57…. Reply Info, i dont know who to beleive. As a huge fif fan, i’m remaining objective. fif does most things to perfection. so it wouldnt be far fetched if blueprints of the house and many steps were in place to make sure the house burned and everyone remain unscathed. thats what professionals are hired for. him being in louisiana doesnt mean anything. unfortunately his ex-girl doesnt have the polish or class to keep her statements to a minimum. so it makes her look suspect as well. but whomever is found to be responsible needs jailtime. whatever issues adults have, it SHOULD NEVER BE AT THE EXPENSE OF KIDS! Reply I am a fan of Fifs, but keeping that out of this I just dont think he is stupid like that to do this?  First, he is one of the richest rappers period, would he put all that at risk by doing this?  Not only the arson, but it could have killed someone.  Then not to mention, no matter how he feels about her, his son lives at the house, and their is no well maybe he did this and thought his son wasnt home, bullshit, his son lives their and this shit happend real early in the morning, so the kid was their.  So would FIf do that?  Please.  Not to mention he is winning in court, she has to leave the crib, so why would he burn it down?  And she acting like she is some knockout and shit, she is busted, aint nobody want her broke down ass, only reason them dudes is fucking with her is cause they get to live in Fifs house.  I wouldnt be surprised if she did this to the house, like If i cant live their, you gonna kick me out, I burn this bitch like Left Eye, after the fight they had, she could sell it like Fif is crazy and tried to kill her, maybe setting up some way Fif has to give her money, they are homeless now.  Then she running to all the news shit blaming Fif for this, I think she is bullshit.  So if someone broke in the house an hour before the fire, what the fuck?  And you didnt call the cops.  Funny everyone is safe though right?  Either her, or one of them dudes or their boys set that shit up, without a doubt.  Fucking bird brain bitch. Reply 1.If someone brakes into my crib or temporary in her case i don’t go back to sleep like nothing i call po po. 2.Why would fif burn a crib with his son inside if he was ever got serious about killing her i sure he would make sure his seed wasn’t home. I smell some Lisa Lopes shit. Reply they haven’t arrested that bitch yet????? 50 is too smart to do something so dumb like that. 50 did not get where he at by being stupid, Shaniqua know she set that house on fire and i hope she is arrested for it Reply have u seen marquises myspace he got it made iphones chains money 50 spoils that kid its just that woman damn choose better next time Reply who read this shit?who the fuck?come on yall actin like fucki paparazzi out there.
PLEASE!act like humans!dude too rich for that type of BS.
miss info ur smile is ridiculous.holler at ya french boy.. Reply Miss Info is your one stop hip hop pitstop! Reply got this from another site..
Disgruntled men put their children in harms way all the time. And if that’s the argument against 50 setting the fire, why would she put her TWO children in harm’s way? It’s amazing how many cases go through the family court system where the guy tells his ex, “I’ll burn the house down.”  The thing about six people being in the house is this: Shaniqua would have to either be in cahoots with the other adults in the house and thereby be at risk of someone turning state’s evidence against her and getting caught OR she would be acting alone and risking the lives of five other people, not to mention one of the other people catching her sloshing gasoline or whatever around the house before the fire was set. If she set the house on fire and the other five didn’t get out, she has five murder charges hanging on her head along with arson charges.
The six occupants of the house were rescued from an upper deck, if I heard correctly. Why would you set a house on fire and go UPSTAIRS? Harder to get out if you’re upstairs.
The said she heard someone come in and yet TMZ took the liberty of twisting her words into “someone broke in.” If there were six people in the house and she heard someone come in, she probably wouldn’t call 911 because she thought it was someone who was supposed to be there. Duh. And i have to agree.. Just b/c he rich and alot to lose, doesn’t mean he didn’t.. rich people do stupid ish everyday. Reply @whoaint….hmmm good points! It would take a lot of trust to get the other adults in line….unless there was alot of money promised? But if the baby moms didnt mean to insinuate that a break-in took place then why did her lawyer even leak that lil tidbit to TMZ?
I think from the photos that the porch was raised but no necessarily on an upstairs floor….as in, the house seemed set on some kind of hill or uneven land, so the porch may have been main floor but still elevated from the outside landscaping? honestly I’m totally confused about the whole thing….but thanks for the insight! Reply @whoaint Most of these disgruntled men aren’t 8 figure niggas who is actually getting the better of the child support situation. Not only that, but she was going to be out the house in June anyway. Maybe if she won the case and got to keep the house there would be more of a motive, but that bitch was on her way out. He has absolutely nothing to gain by this and everything to lose. If 50 gonna burn anybodies house down its going to be Ja or Irv’s. Reply let me find out this was an accident.perhaps someone forgot to put out a ciggarette/blunt and the curtains that are made out of egyptian silk(lol)caught on fire which quickly spread to the other rooms in the house and now this greedy worthless bitch running around talking bout “my babyfather tried to kill me and our son” now if thats the case she should go to jail for making false accusations. she’s out there talking crazy.somebody tame that beast.please. Reply FiF aint burn that house down, that broad crazy, she pissed that she got to get ghost and move. Reply HOLD UP IN THAT VIDEO OF THEM YELLING IN THE STREET DOES SHE REALLY SAY “YEAH RUN RUN”AS HE’S BEING FORCEFULLY PULLED AWAY?THATS A CLEAR SIGN OF A HOODRAT.NOW SHE,ME AND YOU BOTH KNOW IF HIS PEOPLE WEREN’T LOOKING OUT FOR HIS BEST INTERESTS HE WOULD’VE PUT HER DOME TO THE CONCRETE.LMAO. Reply Well she may have been in the house to stay.. The day before the fire, her attorney is claiming a email was produced that would prove his orginal plan was to give her and his son the house. So i guess that’s why she would scream He did it. Plus he threatened her on Monday. Reply and..
@What it do
We also never had a NFL players wife and male companion died on their porch before OJ..
I’m not saying he did it… but when everyone is like “he would never,etc’
we don’t know what that man is capable of. And when emotions are involved people will do crazy things. And he’s known not to handle conflict well. I just have alot of questions and like to look at all sides. Reply I’m not buying he did this one… She knew she was going to get the boot by court order soon and pulled this stunt…. And once we find out where the fire started at we will know for sure that she did it… On another note why would dude threaten his son life like that? He had no way of knowing where the kid was going to be in the house or how it would spread. 50 a shady dude but I aint buying him for this one… She mad, her peoples was trying to beat 50 up after court and now this….  But the deal breaker for me is the “If he can’t have me no one can” part lol Thats funny on so many levels and sort of make her look like a fool. The not being happy with 25k a month and a house part kind of makes her looks BAD and capable of acting out of hate and greed… But on a serious note why can’t G-Unit release an album without all types of drama killing the momentum? They have to know this is not helping the brand… Reply @whoaint Good points but…She would of been out by June _ 2008 ,Even though she had other people in the house she could of been a fit of rage like ” fcuk it ill burn this bitxh up ” and the other adults in the house were like ” na chill chill ” in the middle of everything the small fire she started in said area/room is now out of control and now a story has to be made up to cover up the sittuation .She heard someone come into the house hmmm so shes saying 50 gave whoever keyes to kill her or she always keeps her doors/windows open .Ask Busta what he had to go through with his baby moms ill leave it at that . Reply However I don’t want to take any sides.  You could look at several things here someone could be trying to frame FIDDY. Did you all see the fighting in the middle street? Shan was running up to 50 trying to provoke him and his people was trying to get him in the vehicle. She was yelling and acting like a damn fool in those street. Fiddy acting a fool too. Who knows Fiddy better, Shan and she knows how to push his button to make him go off. That is the perfect time in public where everyone can see FIDDY loose his COOL. Another scenario even though Fiddy had everything going in his favor. Shan said they had proof, email proof that indicates FIDDY says she could have the house which could backfire on Fiddy. Reply @ Whoaintstupid “Known not to handle conflict well”? Every time somebody pisses him off the worst he does is make music about them.  Its easy to say he would never do it when there is no motivation. She was leaving in June, the house was going to be his again, his own son was in the house, and he was getting the better of the case. He was already winning so he didn’t need to do this. Reply @ Miss Info according to a report the off duty cop who rescued them says he directed them to a deck and they had to jump down to him. I also read that a judge recently granted her stay to remain in the house until after the litigation was settled which means she could remain in the house indefinitely.
I don’t want to point fingers at anyone without hearing more information but I don’t think she has a motive to burn the house down since she is asking for the home as part of the settlement in the breach of contract suit and she no longer had a deadline to leave.
Another point is without a place to live she is vulnerable in a custody suit. She had nothing to gain by burning down the house. Reply Also I just thought what if one of  the other adults came in from hanging out went to cook something and left the stove on and fell asleep happens all the time  and what happend to the smoke alarms ? Reply @WhoaintStupid
I read about the e-mail where she was promised the house and the lawyer is claiming 50 signed something promising her half his earnings. If the e-mail and the contract where 50 agreed to give her half his earnings actually exist then she really had 50’s back against the wall. Reply missInfo as a mother if my children nearly die in a house fire i would be holding on to them for dear life thanking GOD for saving them life crying like hell.
i certainly would not leave my kids to come back to the house and talking to reporters. 50 cazy baby mama need to be lock up and 50 cent gets his son and stay away from her cause she really hates 50 cent and she will do anything to gets his money. Reply yall pointing the finger at the wrong person, it was the dancer who ciara fired who did it Reply Yo 50’s baby Mom’s is crazy. 1. If 50 is the monster she claims he is why even ask him for money, you’d want to distant yourself from the said psycho. 2.If you know he’s capable of harming you why live in his house and ask for child support? 3. When 50 had his son she tried to go see his son she called cops on him why not give him visitation rights that keep him off the property. She is something else yo, If I wanted someoe out of my house, I wouldn’t burn it down, i’d cut off electricity water e.t.c but burn down $1.5 Million property is foolish. I dnt believe nothing she says coz her character is visible from her actions she’s obsessed with 50’s lifestyle & wants a cut and 50 is just tryin to get rid of her. Reply 50 burning down the house?  That’s inconsistent with his character.  Think about it: 1. Didn’t he recently give Willy Northpole (or some other C list artist) the boot for “allegedly” selling drugs out of his CT mansion? 2. This is a man who said he didn’t want to beef with his baby mama because he didn’t want his son to resent him.   3. Remember when she stabbed him up?  lol.  He didn’t flip on her for that.   4. Dre/M&M were surprised at how level headed he was when they first sat down and spoke.   5. He was willing to give her MORE money than she asked for until the judge deaded that. Now I’m not saying he’s not ruthless because, obviously, he can be.  But to do dumb sh1t like this?  Especially when she was getting the boot in 30 days?  Putting his son, career, money and life at risk?  Out of character. Now if he told his goonies to just handle it (without wanting to know the details) and they fukced it up, that’s another story. And lol @ these comments from the allhiphop.com article: “Yadadamean said:
Ahhh…The goons at work. Make dem niggaz work. Well dats one way to get a bitch out and get da insurance money.

Thats what you get when you fuck wit chicks named Shaniqua.  You just dont get hoodrats pregnant its a big mistake
May 30, 2008 2:24 PM” Reply i think the babymama did.she probably thinks like”if i cant have it,he wont either”.she seems like that type to me.but her dumb ass wasnt thinking because 50 gonna get that insurance and theres no  home available to mooch off 50 for.besides,they said someone inside the home started it.looks like an episode of”worlds most stupid criminals”in the making.i agree with Big’s comment,G-Unit always got something going on around album release time.smh Reply @WhoaintStupid – Good point..OJ Simpson LOL Reply Whoaint i dig what u sayin, but Curtis is the type of nigga who is about that money… I know that house is just a chink maybe and insurance would take care of some of it, but if the chick gotta get out why pay to have a pro burn it down$$$ knowing that you’re the one who has to pay to get that shit rebuilt. Plus the fact that she’s runnin all over the place screamin that he did it is just a lil too convenient for me… She’s obviously a bird, cause if she was smart or had smart people around her she would know that publicly accusing someone of a crime without proof or evidence or witnesses is grounds for a slander case (not like he’ll get anything outta it, but it would put his G-unit smeakers in her face for good measure). Reply WhoaintStupid got some GOOD POINTS! Her attys office WAS trashed by G-Unit peeps for SOME REASON!? She just may have been gettin’ that house, we don’t know. The lawyer’s SMUTT tho, WHY da FIDDUCK is he talking to TMZ??? Fif need to watch his “peeps” tho. Niggaz more jealous than bitches nowadays over their niggas. One of fifs peeps may have called himself “HELPING his MANz” & took thangs into his own hands or some crazy “STAN” couldve did it! We don’t know shyt! The WORLD knows they got problems! ALSO, I’ve heard TOO many Baby Mommas myself threaten baby daddys to kill their kids cuz they couldn’t have their way! This chick aint NO DIFFERENT than the hoodyratts I know! (I KNEW that hoe was dumb when she showed up in court with tight booty jeans & a low cutt tee! NO CLASS!) Anywhoo, I’ve also seen niggaz get overly emotional & threaten baby mamas, too. But Fif aint no RN (regular nigga) like the ones I’ve seen do that tho. Moral is: “THOU SHALT NOT BE EMOTIONALLY RULED”, period! NUFF SAID! Reply u never see nas and carmen doin no shit like this Reply JIMMY HENCHMEN DID IT
                   !!!!!!!!! Reply 50 is no saint…but I doubt he did this.  Now, why the hell he couldn’t put his pride aside and just leave this dumb woman in that house.  1.5 Million is not that much money in 50 terms, and he would have avoided all this agravation. If only for his kid.   I doubt that this woman is deserving, but his son is needs a good place to live and less drama.  All which would be less if he had allowed her to remain in the house.  Poor kid we don’t choose who our parents are. Reply yo  fif ain’t stupid,he a P.I.M.P he ain’t gonna risk erything over some ugly dumb ass broad. Reply I got MADD LOVE for 50, BUT from what I’ve gathered, there was NO PROBLEM with ratty Baby Moms stayin in that house UNTIL she gotta new man to keep her company! 50 still loves her (to a degree) & OBVIOUSLY wants to control her & has shown us that he gets very upset when he cannot do so. He publicly stated he hasn’t had a real girlfriend SINCE her, but suddenly SHE has a man, in his house! Do U REALLY think 50 can handle that well? The man couldn’t handle Kanye outselling him! I’ll bet when he first gave her that house it wasn’t made clear it was ONLY based on her remaining a single old maid. He just thought (“KNEW”) she was gonna live that lonely life under his support 4 ever=STRATEGIC GENEROSITY & OPRESSION. (Just like Irv Gotti said to Deb-“Aint nobody gonna want you….” etc) Well, no matter HOW ignorant she is, her side should be heard openly (& filtered) as well. Don’t say rich baby daddies/husbands won’t kill tho…..Ray Caruth, Robert Blake, OJ Simpson, Chris Benoit…. So WHO KNOWS??!! Reply 50 didnt do that. Her crazy a** did that. She a gold digger and why didnt she buy her own house when he was giving her $50,000 a month for child support. Then she could have as many men as she want to come live with her.  By the way she act you can tell she a hoodrat. Even before all this happened 50 said she hasnt let him see his son since april. He need to get custody.  And as for her thinking he want her, why would he want her when he could mess with more intelligent women because it is obvious she is low class, look how she carries herself, yelling out in the street, talking about he’s trying to kill her.  Hoe sit down! Reply @WHO AINT……in cases where men are just so crazy over their ex and they can’t stand the thought of another man they usually don’t have a six month delayed reaction to it. he’s asked the court long ago to evict her once the child support issue was settled, and went back to court on April 3rd and won the right to evict her because she is a squatter, he had won the case end of story. If he loved her so much to the point of obsession he would of married her at some point, or atleast taken her to one event,  and refer to her as his woman as some point, he’s been in the public eye for 5 years now and not once has he said they were together always referred to their relationship as a thing of the past, they may have had their private dealings on and off but if he were truly stressed out about her, wouldn’t there have been some signs. In every interview i’ve seen he claimed they never really got along and that she is money hungry  also the truth shouldn’t change, you say tmz twisted her words by saying she said a break in, well a local reporter for news 12 spoke to a neighbor who arrived shortly after they escaped the fire and he quoted her as saying the same thing, also i notice in one article she said she was woke already because marquise was sick and in another she said she was awakened by the molotav cocktail flying thru the window. so were you up already or were you awakened, did someone break in or did someone throw something threw the window, she is not consistent  and instead of allowing police to investigate she more interested in holding press conferences with no evidence saying her sons father did it, which can be traumatizing for a 10 yr old to hear, and she keeps screaming that for the cameras  even if she as the mother believes 50 to be responsible it is irresponsible to go public with something that can be so devastating with a child she should assist police (in private interviews held at a station not usually in the street with reporters) and hope for a thorough investigation which would lead to an arrest of the guilty parties Reply we all know how babys fathers can get really posessive. Sometimes they think just because you had their child they own you. So her saying if he can’t have her noone can have her is really not that far fetched. It has nothing to do with her looks. It has to do with his egocentric, arrogent ways especially because she had moved on and had her boyfriend living with her. Seems to me in his mind he probably feels he is being humiliated. Seems he is the one that needs to move on. Reply 50 cent baby mother is making a lots error in trying to set up 50 cent she didn’t  speak to her lawyer before she start talking. part of the plan is to make everyone think it’s 50 cent that why she talking to reporters saying it 50 cent. but the law will catch her Reply Maybe the Game did it…. Reply @dedee.
boyfriends are obsessed with girlfriends all the time doesn’t matter he never married her. It’s about control, he for once since he “made it big” was losing control. And she may win. He said in a video when coming out the courtroom “Of course i won, i always do”. So someone who’s known for always winning and being in power.. how do u think they would react?? And different report alway surface.. that was reported she said someone came in at 4am. And going to see about your property, and having reporters stick a mic in your face is not a press conference. Of course she was hot, she thinks the father of her child is trying to kill her.  They both needed to be the bigger person in the past for the sake of their son, now he might loss one of them because they couldn’t work past their differences Reply Okay Boyfriends are obsessed with girlfriends all the time right, but 1 fact y’all don’t seem to get is  1. Shaniqua does not work.
2.She has 1 son out of wedlock with Fif and another daughter and a live in boyfriend.  Fif ain’t responsible for supporting her daughter or boyfriend yet they live in his $1.4Mil mansion. 3. She limits the time 50 spends with his son which would frustrate any father, 50 does international tours e.t.c so he doesn’t have enought time as it is to spend with his son. Visitation rights has been a problem right. 4. She knows she can’t afford a 1.4 Mill mansion or continue to live the lifestyle she lives without Fif coz her new man’s a bum ya dig? Coz clearly he doesn’t own any property he’s on some Kay Fed swag. 5. If someone told you to leave their house? Why would you stay? You ain’t his wife so she’s not entitled to the same rights as a ex-wife The legal system is to blame here, they should have evicted her, finalised the child support entitlement and conclude litigation before things get ugly coz it can’t be healthy for the kids. Plus 50 wouldn’t harm his son, I’d be pissed if I had to support someone i don’t love or care about. Reply 50 cent greedy baby mother have tried everything to make 50 cent look bad , take away his freedom and ruin his career.
and know she is calling him a bad dad which everyone knows how much 50 cent loves his son.
and the property is not hers as i am aware it belongs to 50 cent so she should have stayed and look after her kids any good mother would do.
and do not think herf bady father want to kill her else she would have report it just like how she report that he push her. Reply IF 50 DON’T STAY AWAY FROM HIS BM HIS LIFE WILL BE OVER BECAUSE SHE IS DOING EVERYTHING TO FINISH HIM OFF. THAT UGLY ASS BM OF  50 CENT REALLY HATES HIM AND SHE IS DISGRACEFUL. Reply Wow this is crazy…  Im so sick and tired to people jumping on the women’s backs when there is a problem…  This chick is obviously crazy…  @ who aint, y the hell would 50 bother with this woman…  He is like the only man ever to be on the winning side of a child support battle…  that chick is not any of all that and Im pretty sure 50 has knocked off mad celeb chicks…  cut the bs man…  This chick is a gold diggin wh0re and she mad that she cant get her way…  She has absoultely no evidence of anything…  and even if she did his lawyers is beast…  a yr of probation for attempted murder, are you people realizing wats going on here…  Yo 50 is not a dickhead…  And it is very obvious that he loves his son more than he hates that wh0re so cut it out…  some people need to use there brain more…. Reply This dame is bonkers yo. She ain’t got no skills besides gettin into 50’s pockets. And she ain’t that good at that either.   How come none of this drama wasn’t there before 50’s name came out on Forbes.  You know she be sitting around with her hood rat girlfriends talking about ,”The man got mills, you carried his child you need to get some of that millions he be flauntin in the videos.”  If she ain’t supposed to be living in 50’s house that means 50 can charge her rent and not have to pay child support coz she’d be in arrears on rent.  50 needs a new legal team coz I dn’t need to pass the bar exam to frustrate that crazy woman to vacate the property and give up custody. Reply come on this is common sense he had da house already why would he burn it down and then she quickly implicates him–man this bird has been trying to get in this dudes pockets for months and they all end up at the same place whether it’s on an upper floor or not they knew how to get out–this shit is really stupid.  she was getting out the house come on man Reply contactmusci is reporting that 2 more house  burn down 1 hour before 50 cent own house burn and there maybe a link but fif son  mother was quick to point finger on him before the investigation finish. all fif cent hoodrat baby mother is cares about is getting her hand on fif money. she is screaming all over the place that fif should call her to speak to his son so that she can tell more lies on him, that him said him going to come finish the job of killing her. fif please stay away  FROM THAT WICK BABY MOTHER OF YOURS we all know that you LOVE YOUR SON very much. you have always take care of your son  her daughter that is not yours plus her and her family too. that ugly bit*h couldn’t fif get anyone else OMG she is buck ugly Reply His baby mother is desperate.  50 was already giving her $50,000 a month in child support and paying all the household bills. She didnt have to pay nothing, she had it made, but she got greedy and wanted more money. 50 took her to court to get a set amount he could pay her because she was being overly greedy.  How many men do you know that files child support papers on themselves?  Go ahead I’ll wait…NONE!! It just goes to show what type of man he is. And as far as her living up in his house rent and bill free and she got a dead beat man living up in there, thats disrespectful not only to the man that is taking care of you but also to your son. What kind of example is that to set for the kids?…all that is doing is teaching them to be irresponsible and to go live off of other people. I dont know anybody that wants to take care of their ex’s boyfriend or girlfriend, that do not make someone “obsessed” just because he didnt want her boyfriend and his homeboys living there. I agree with Anon, this is out of 50’s character.  I dont think he would risk all this hard work he’s done over the years to lose it all for a hoodrat and especially to hurt his son.  He already said that he started rapping because of his son that basically his son saved his life when he came along. Reply @ all u dumb ass bitches out there like rose, sharon & u r stupid, no way in hell would fif promise that dumb ass hood rat bitch half his fortune. 4 what? did she take half the shots, write half the rhymes? what has this bird really done 2 get half. i am also quite sure if he did promise her that none of this would’ve happened because she would b 1 happy gold digging bitch.& 4 all u dumb fucks out there if I was in a similar position I wouldn’t mind my baby moms having another man but go fuck him @ his house or a hotel not at the place I provide 4 my child & further more fif bought the house so his son can live comfortable & this hood rat bitch only in the picture because she had his son. HALF hahahahaha what a fucking joke. Reply @ u dumb ass super h8 i did not say anything bad about 50 cent so please read what i said ok and i will say it again 50 cent bm is wicked and ugly it seems as if 50 cent could not get any other woman to sleep with than her.
i was just praying she didn’t use that  ugly face and crack my tv cause i would have find her and bust her ass.
cause that what she want and 50 cent will not do it. Reply first off i dont 50 think 50 cent would do that one that was mike tyson old house so he put money in to that..two he son was in the house come now do you really think he would do that be for real..three he already had the house whne the judge awarded him the house..if you ask me his baby mother is angry and want money,,thats all its two it..and what the comment she mad..if he cant have me no one else can.bitch please if he wanted to im pretty sure he would of got back with you along time ago..shes just crazy ass girl..whos greedy for money..how abiut you get a job bitch and stop living on 50…she think oh i have hes baby no bitch all hd cares for his son ,,and if yiu ask me 50 need to get custody of his son..she crazy Reply This situation needs to be resolved immediately; I hope know one gets hurt.

Shaniqua Tompkins
 50 Cent Skips Son's High School Graduation, Gets BLASTED on Facebook 50 Cent: Pillow Talk Ain't No Contract 50 Cent Owns Shaniqua Tompkins 50 Cent: Shaniqua Tompkins Kidnapped Marquise 50 Cent Sort of Wins Custody Battle Shaniqua Tompkins Calls Shenanigans on 50 Cent Lawyer 50 Cent to Shaniqua Tompkins: You Got Served! Shaniqua Tompkins Sues Rapper, Wants More Than 50 Cents Follow Shaniqua Tompkins? Shaniqua Tompkins Biography Shaniqua Tompkins is the source of 50 Cent's baby mama drama. She is the mother of his son, Marquise. She also accused him of trying to... 
	The bizarre feud between 50 Cent and his son Marquise dates back to last year when Father of the Century candidate Fiddy unleashed a profane tirade against his then 16-year-old son. 
 Note to Shaniqua Tompkins: If 50 Cent makes you some nice promises after a good lay, don't hold him to it. At least not in a court of law. That's the basic gist of his latest legal action. 50 Cent is firing back at his baby mama after she filed a $50 million breach of contract suit. Did 50 Cent really try to burn down the house where Marquise - his 11-year-old son, resided? Did Marquise's mom kidnap him and hold him against 50's will? These questions remain very much unclear. Continuing to trade barbs, allegations and lawsuits with his estranged baby mama, 50 Cent says Shaniqua Tompkins is holding their son hostage. Fiddy and Shaniqua have been at each other's throats ever since that fire that destroyed the house the rapper bought for her and Marquise. Shaniqua Tompkins, step off! Rapper / human flak jacket 50 Cent got what he wanted in the latest chapter of his baby mama drama - kind of. A Long Island judge has granted him an unrestricted visit from August 3-12 with Marquise, his son with former girlfriend Shaniqua Tompkins. 50 Cent's baby mama Shaniqua Tompkins wants 50's lawyer off their case - because, according to her, that guy knows her legal strategy! According to TMZ, Shaniqua has huddled with 50 Cent's lawyer, Brett Kimmel, in the past - before the custody battle over their son, Marquise, began. 50 Cent's ex-baby mama, Shaniqua Tompkins, got a restraining order this morning against the rapper - then got served with a huge-ass lawsuit. Lawyers for 50 Cent took it to Shaniqua Tompkins, slapping her upside the head with a $20 million defamation suit in Connecticut court. Shaniqua Tomkins, 50 Cent's baby's mama, has filed a new lawsuit against the rapper. According to our bitter rival, Perez Hilton, she's accusing the rapper of "breach of contract and unjust enrichment." He supposedly broke a promise to give Tomkins and their son Marquise a house.

Comments (42) Badge nomination  Related Groups Please sign in Get Help Membership & Newsletters BabyCenter Shortcuts BabyCenter Mobile Our U.S. Sites Our International Sites A lot of people have asked me this question and I want to know your inputs. I'd rather be called "the mother of my child" or by my name. Me and my SD (Elijah's bio dad) are not together and we both have moved on so when someone is talking about me or when he refers to me, he always says "my baby mama". I don't get offended because that is what I am to him but I do HATE to be called "a baby mama" because I'm so much more than just a baby mama. I am my son's teacher, friend, provider, nurturer, entertainment at times, and his mother. Now with DF he does NOT call me his BM...he calls me his GF, fiance, son's mother, his boo, his everything. I guess it depends on the relationship between the parents. IDK....some people think it's trashy to be called a baby mama. To me it sounds trashy/ghetto. What do you ladies think? ~*Brittany proud mommy of 2 busy lil men...Elijah (10-28-07) & Bryson (10-9-09)*~ I AM, CHELSEI'S MOTHER or EBONI. To me "baby mama/ baby daddy" is grammatically incorrect, therefore I don't even allow it to slip from my lips. It was coined to degrade people who were not married to other half that helped conceive their child. RIght on Eboni!!!!!!!!!!!!! That is SO true! ~Stephanie - Mama to Noah, Doula, Certified Lactation Counselor, Midwife, Registered Nurse, Childbirth Educator. Sweet Little Bundles Birth Services here's an interesting definition: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_mama NEW SCREEN NAME: Mochamom9807 proud GO of several BBC groups for mocha mamas like me! proud mama of DS#1(98) and DS#2(07) Interesting Latania, both are pretty much agreeing lol 
 I already said I didn't like the way it sounded, I am just trying to get to the bottom of why the negative connotation is attached to it. I think it applies to some women, and not in a good way, that is why I separate myself from it. I think we here feel that we are more than just an ex-girlfriend, and I know I am not a desparate gold digger. NEW SCREEN NAME: Mochamom9807 proud GO of several BBC groups for mocha mamas like me! proud mama of DS#1(98) and DS#2(07) Jusluvnmyboys- I feel you on that because I'm far from desperate or a gold digger. He don't have no gold ne way. LOL The mother of your child(ren), whom you did not marry and with whom you are not currently involved I think I agree with this one. Me and my Bd had a relationship to say the least but we're not involved now. He calls me his baby mama or ej mama. ~*Brittany proud mommy of 2 busy lil men...Elijah (10-28-07) & Bryson (10-9-09)*~ I don't like the term "baby momma" or "baby daddy".  Just cal me by my damn name lol!  or call me (insert childs name here)'s mother. I don't play dat s**t at all and he knows it. We are together and we have a soon to be 7 month old. Our first son passed. I told dude long ago dat I don't do that "baby momma" mess. It's derogatory and I don't call him my "baby daddy". That s**t is wack, for real. I agree I think its very disrespectful and I hate when my boyfriend says it. Its ridiculous cuz we go out!! It makes me feel horrible like thats all  am is a baby mama. Guys just make me mad !! I like this board I think i'll join lol. Oh hell no. I don't like that name at all. He tried to call me that and i corrected his behind quick. I said I'm the mother of your child not your baby mama. I'm not your anything. I think the word is disrespectful. When i think about what it means and way BDs use,  I does not describe me or what i do. It stereotypes woman. I can't stand the word. Paquita, mommy to my beautiful honeybunny. Have a blessed day!!         Barack Obama's wife Michelle a 'baby mama' says Fox News

		Wednesday 17 February 2016  By Urmee Khan  12:18PM BST 13 Jun 2008  The news network referred to Mr Obama's wife Michelle as "Obama's baby mama", which is considered a derogatory term used for black single mothers.   It has been interpreted as a further racial slur on Mr Obama and the latest instance where the Right-wing network has disparaged the Obamas.   The graphic "Outraged liberals: Stop picking on Obama's baby mama" was flashed during an interview with a conservative columnist, Michelle Malkin, on Wednesday, about whether Mr Obama's wife had been the target of unfair criticism.   Bill Shine, senior vice president of programming at Fox, said in a statement that a producer "exercised poor judgment" during the segment.   In the last few days, E.D. Hill, a Fox anchor, has apologised for referring to an affectionate onstage fist bump shared by the couple as a ''terrorist fist jab,'' and Fox contributor Liz Trotta said she was sorry for joking about an Obama assassination after confusing him with al-Qa'eda leader Osama bin-Laden.  
Fox News presenter taken off air after Barack Obama 'terrorist fist jab' remark
  Ms Trotta said: "I sincerely regret it and apologise to anybody I've offended," she said. "It's a very colourful political season and many of us are making mistakes and saying things that we wish we hadn't said."   Karl Frisch, a spokesman for Media Matters, a liberal watchdog, said: "This is part of a broader problem with Fox: out of bound comments are followed by a half-baked apology. At some point Fox has got to decide if it is a responsible news source."   The Obama campaign have launched a website to dispel rumours about his faith and patriotism and his wife's views on race as he prepares to compete for the White House in November.   The new website denies the allegations Mrs Obama used the racially divisive term "whitey," and tackles false claims that Mr Obama is a secret Muslim, as some blogs and conservative commentators have claimed.

Questions and Answers Don't let drama ruin YOUR life! In our parents' day (assuming you're over the age of 25) couples seemed to have the same game plan: meet someone, date, fall in love, get married, have kids, become retirees and move to Boca Raton. In this day and age, it's not so cut and dried. With split-parent households becoming the norm, the modern gal has new scenarios to deal with: namely how to step into a split parent situation that existed before your new relationship with the father did. 
In many situations seemingly, the mother isn't going to be overly receptive. Nothing you do seems to be good enough, everything that comes out of their mouth seems to be venom that puts such a strain on you and your relationship. Don't let it bring you down!

Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch’intrate Breathe a bad word about Michelle Obama and you’ll be cast into the fiery bowels of hell, says Reverend Dick Durbin. Here’s my hell-baiting Fox segment on Michelle earlier this afternoon.  Quick correction: In the segment, I mention Salon as having published criticism of Mrs. O. I meant Slate. Got my left-wing websites mixed up. My apologies and thanks to Alex Koppelman of Salon for pointing out the error.  I’m sure Salon will make sure everyone knows that they aren’t going to burn with the rest of us. *** Update: Salon is in high dudgeon over a caption that Fox ran during my segment referring to Michelle Obama as Obama’s “baby mama.” I did not write the caption and I was not aware of it when it ran (the Baltimore studio doesn’t have a monitor). I don’t know if the caption writer was making a lame attempt to be hip, clueless about the original etymology of the phrase, or both. But I do know that it was Michelle Obama herself who referred to Barack as her “baby’s daddy” and has used the phrase “baby daddy” to describe Barack while on the stump this year. Here’s how she introduced him during his Senate victory speech on Nov. 2, 2004: MICHELLE OBAMA, WIFE OF BARACK OBAMA: My baby’s daddy Barack Obama. Yeah! BARACK OBAMA, SENATOR-ELECT, ILLINOIS: Thank you, Illinois. Thank you. Thank you, Illinois. I don’t know about you but I’m still fired up. I am fired up. Look at this crowd. Thank you, Illinois.  Let me begin by thanking all the people who have been involved in this effort from down state to upstate, city, suburb, from every community throughout the state. Let me say how grateful I am to all of you for the extraordinary privilege of standing here this evening. Let me thank, because I will forget later on, it’s a thankless task, let me thank right now the best political staff that has been put together in this state. They are wonderful. You know who you are. You guys have been outstanding. I appreciate all of you. Let me thank my pastor, Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr. (ph) of Trinity United Church of Christ, fellow Trinitarians out there. Let me thank all the elected officials who have stood by me through thick and through thin but most of all let me thank my family. I am so grateful to my nephew Aber (ph), my niece Leslie (ph), my mother-in-law Marian (ph), my brother-in-law Craig Robinson, his wonderful girlfriend Kelly (ph), my sister Maya (ph), my new niece Zuhayla (ph) right there, my brother-in-law Conrad and most of all, most of all, my two precious daughters Malia (ph) Obama and Sasha (ph) Obama and the biggest star in the Obama family until the two girls grow up the love of my life Michelle Obama, give it up for Michelle. Give it up. See here for a 2004 discussion of Obama’s comments the day after she made them. Sample: Posted on Friday, November 05, 2004 – 03:19 pm:
You’re right Cynique, he hasn’t proved himself. I’m just going by his demeanor thus far, as well as my intuitive feeling about him–and that is how I feel about his potential at this point–I could see him as president. His wife has nothing to do with how I feel either, especially after her “my baby’s daddy” comment. She is a doll (physically), but that comment turned me off! Posted on Friday, November 05, 2004 – 04:32 pm:
Well, I’m sure his wife’s remark didn’t turn off Obama’s black constituency; it was kind of an inside joke. Yes, Obama is very charismatic but you sounded as if you wanted to prove a point by jocking him rather than John Edwards who has, after all, served 6 years in the senate. See, Moonsigns, that how you get in trouble on this sight. LOL Posted on Friday, November 05, 2004 – 04:55 pm:
OH FOR PITY’S SAKE Moonsigns, could you have you lips puckered against cyniques ass any tighter?? Could you be any more OBVIOUS AND DESPERATE to keep her as an ally? What a freakin joke you are. Oh you are so right cynique, oh please don’t get mad at me cynique! give it a rest aready!! Posted on Friday, November 05, 2004 – 06:22 pm:
Some blacks may find that “inside joke” to be “funny”, however, I’m sure not all do. To me, it’s a joke that is used only in the company of very, very close friends, not in a public arena with millions of people watching. I have no point to prove to anyone Cynique. There are some people who seem like natural born leaders and others that just don’t. Edwards, in my opinion, just seems to lack a certain something that would propel him into being a tremendous leader. Obama on the other hand, he just seems like he has unlimited amounts of potential and the zeal to follow through–just a basic difference I feel about the men….that’s it. Posted on Friday, November 05, 2004 – 07:36 pm:   	 You’re entitled to your assessment about Obama, Moonsigns. But, neither you nor I know how many blacks were offended by the comment Obama’s wife made. And, actually, I don’t see why there would be a problem since he is her “baby Daddy.” And I don’t think it is uncommon for black women, no matter what her station in life, to teasingly refer to their child’s father as their “baby daddy.” This ghetto expression has made it into the mainstream of the black idiom, at least in my part of the country which is where Obama is from. Blacks don’t always have to be on their good behavior for fear of making a bad impression on white people. Sometimes they can just “get down” and show that they haven’t lost the common touch. Jesse Jackson does this all the time, as did Chicago’s first black mayor, Harold Washington who once referred to a failing plan as being in “deep doo-doo.” Anybody offended by what Obama’s wife said, should just get over it. Posted on Friday, November 05, 2004 – 08:36 pm:
Though you have pointed out that this “ghetto expression” has “made it into the mainstream of the black idiom” (which I agree), I don’t think it’s safe to say that all blacks accept it. You know as well as I do that not all blacks think alike and that is why I know that, while you nor I can give exact numbers as to just how many blacks were offended, I’m sure there are some out there who were. Again, there are no absolutes. “Blacks don’t always have to be on their good behavior for fear of making a bad impression on white people.”-Cynique I agree. Do you feel this applies to all races though? Posted on Friday, November 05, 2004 – 09:05 pm:   	 I’ll be praying for Elizabeth Edwards. As for Michelle Obama’s “baby’s daddy” comment–I was in room with black people from all over the world when she made it. A black American couple owned the home I was in. There was a Somali model and her biracial daughter—two Ethiopian couples—two Kenyan men—a black couple from Mississippi, another black couple from Arizona, my black mother from Wash.D.C. and two black couples from Jamaica and one from Aruba, West Indies. WE ALL LAUGHED “infectiously” when Michelle made the comment…and in that moment….they became REAL PEOPLE to us. The whole room fell in love with them even more than before. MOON—the only kind of blacks who take offense at a MARRIED black woman calling her hubby “my baby’s daddy”….are the INSECURE ones who have something to prove to “white people”–and usually, those type of blacks wish to BE white themselves. I find it hard to believe that anyone with any real intelligence would be offended by a Harvard Graduate–MARRIED to her “baby’s daddy”….being benevolent enough and politically astute enough to affirm the realities of so many black women who have no education, no men in their lives or their childrens’ lives and who NEEDED that bit of affirmation/recognition from a sista on high. Very rarely are single black mothers–most of whom MAKE A WAY OUT OF NO WAY every damned day of the week….given their props. I know MANY “ghetto women” who hold down a job, go to school, singlehandedly feed and clothe their babies….and BLACK WOMEN in America have been doing this for DECADES. Without much praise. I loved Michelle Obama for having the presence of mind and “cultural caring” to use HER POSITION to affirm a ghetto saying. And I greatly admire so called “ghetto blacks” FAR MORE than I do the black middle class. I love it that OBAMA is so very “Kenyan” and regal and presents himself as a man of his people. FOR THAT..and because I so love his wife’s grace and class, I will spend thousands to support him. Posted on Friday, November 05, 2004 – 11:25 pm:
Well, Moonsigns, as far as I’m concerned this is much ado about nothing since, as we agree, nobody knows how widespread the disapproval was of Michelle’s remark. And who really cares about something this trivial? I think your reference to it says more about you than her. The “baby daddy” reference was no more of a faux pas than some of the things that Kerry’s wife said, or what Laura Bush might say if she could ever stop smiling like an idiot and say anything. Posted on Saturday, November 06, 2004 – 06:55 am:
Cynique, Beyond this discussion, Michelle’s “baby daddy” comment is not a part of my daily thought pattern. Someone had mentioned it earlier in a thread and that is why I shared my feelings about it. Laura Bush does say too little, which can be both good and bad. Kerry’s wife said too much. I wouldn’t have minded her hubby for president, but her as the first lady….that would have been something! LOL Posted on Saturday, November 06, 2004 – 07:53 am:
Moonsigns, I agree with your contrast of Edwards and Obama. Though both men are unproven as leaders, Obama appears to have more innate Presidential timber. And, actually, the smarter/better leader in the Edwards’ household is his wife Elizabeth. That chick is smarter than a MOFO! But really, the “baby daddy” thing is just a joke…between friends. And when I see you (and other you White people) overreact to something as trivial as that, I can’t help wondering whether you are building Obama up just so he’ll have a higher pedestal from which you can knock him down from. PS: My wife calls me her “baby daddy” all the time as a term of endearment. And after I received positive confirmation from the DNA tests, I learned to appreciate that. And more here. *** From “A Brief History of baby-daddies” published in Slate Magazine two years ago: Celebrity gossips are not known for their contributions to English letters. In tabloids, the copy is breathless, the headlines are stunningly literal, and the “hand-written” photo captions seem to toggle between “Awww!” and “Ew!” But as they zero in on celebrity mating and breeding rituals, the magpies keep breaking new linguistic ground. First they imported the British term bump, a noun used to refer to the protruding abdomen of a pregnant starlet. Then they awarded celebrity couples mash-up nicknames like “Bennifer,” “Brangelina,” and “TomKat.” Now they’ve seized upon baby-daddy and baby-mama, two useful terms that have long appeared in hip-hop and R&B lyrics, and are slowly stripping them of their emotional fangs. The Oxford English Dictionary defines baby-daddy as “the father of a woman’s child, who is not her husband or (in most cases) her current or exclusive partner.” The baby-mama entry follows the same template with the genders reversed. But some gossip writers have been adopting the first part of the definition and ignoring the second. Salon recently called Tom Cruise “Katie Holmes’ baby-daddy,” even though the couple is engaged. And Gawker refers to Keven Federline as “Britney Spears’ baby-daddy,” even though the couple has been married for more than a year.  …These days, the terms no longer seem “chiefly African-American”—they’re everywhere, the latest bits of hip-hop lingo to gain widespread use. Baby-daddy is the new bling. Online, you can buy “Jesus is my baby-daddy” magnets, tote bags, and beer steins. There is a drink called the “babymama.” Scott Hoffman, the bassist for the glam rock band the Scissors Sisters, goes by the stage name “Babydaddy.” Some of this cultural paraphernalia retains the old, loaded sense of the term: You can, for example, download a “Salty Baby Mama” ringtone so that when people call, your phone will jangle and thrum while a woman’s voice says, “Baby, I know you hear this damn phone ringing. I’m going to beat your ass, as soon as I see you.” But just as often, the connotations are strictly biological. Baby-mama has even made inroads in Japan, where it’s being used on a Web site that appears to sell strollers. Who knows why these terms became catchphrases? Perhaps it’s just that they’re metrically pleasing: Baby-mama and baby-daddy are undeniably fun to say. But it’s the novelty factor that explains how the words lost their negative connotations. Sure, there are many gossip writers who still use the terms in their original senses (calling dancer Carlos Leon “Madonna’s baby-daddy,” for example) because they’re useful, reducing a complex chain of possessives—Madonna’s daughter’s father—to a nice, comprehensible noun. But it seems there are also plenty of writers who just like the way the words sound and don’t care much about the stigma once attached to babydaddyhood. When news came last week that Anna Nicole Smith may be pregnant, it was no surprise that bloggers immediately began speculating about the identity of the “baby daddy.” It may be a long time before you hear a quaint, old-fashioned “Who’s the dad?” *** Here comes the knee-jerk avalanche of hate mail: from pearlene_scott@cox.net

Video
 Fresh from its fist bump flap, Fox News is taking new flak for a screen caption that referred to Michelle Obama as her husband's "baby mama." Even conservative commentator Michelle Malkin, who was on camera Wednesday afternoon when the line "OUTRAGED LIBERALS: STOP PICKING ON OBAMA'S BABY MAMA" flashed underneath her, has distanced herself from the phrase. In a posting Wednesday night, Malkin wrote: "I did not write the caption, and I was not aware of it when it ran (the Baltimore studio doesn’t have a monitor). I don’t know if the caption writer was making a lame attempt to be hip, clueless about the original etymology of the phrase, or both." Still, Malkin goes off on a tangent on how Michelle Obama, in the past, has referred to her mate as her "baby's daddy" (the point being, presumably, that the phrase was thus in play). You can read Malkin's post here; it includes some of the nasty e-mails she received following her Fox appearance. The folks at Fox are developing something of an obsession over Barack Obama's wife. Tonight's Bill O'Reilly show, according to network promos, will include a discussion of her by conservative radio talk show host Laura Ingraham. The other recent brouhaha ...  ... involving the network was sparked by a segment it did on the fist bump the Obamas exchanged on stage last week as he prepared to proclaim that he had secured sufficient delegates to win the Democratic presidential race. A few days later, Fox anchor E.D. Hill, reading words on a teleprompter that someone else had written, wondered whether the gesture might be interpreted as a "terrorist fist jab." Hill later apologized. Perhaps Fox hired a few too many summer interns to handle some of its behind-the-scenes writing chores. -- Don Frederick   Fox Apologizes for Calling Michelle Obama a ‘Baby Mama’ Sections Sites Sections Search Plus Popular on NYMag.com Tags: Top Stories Most Viewed Stories Latest News from Daily Intelligencer FOLLOW: 
            Yet the network refuses to apologize for making a bad rhyme.
            Fox News has possibly revealed itself to be sexist, racist, and out of touch, all at the same time! The network has come under fire for referring to Michelle Obama as a “baby mama” during a segment in which anchor Megyn Kelly interviewed conservative pundit Michelle Malkin. The two were discussing a conservative group's planned anti-Obama documentary when a caption popped up on the screen reading: "Outraged liberals: Stop picking on Obama's baby mama!"  First of all, a network shouldn’t be allowed to have the word “News” in its title if it goes around saying things like “Obama’s Baby Mama!” This isn’t E!, guys. You’d never see Ryan Seacrest headlining a story about Lindsay Lohan’s Sapphic relationship with Samantha Ronson with “Lindsay’s Alliance With Member of the Female Persuasion Called Into Question, Pending Investigation.” These news networks need to stay on their side of the playground. But this is another blog post for another time.  The lamest part is that the network didn’t even use the slang correctly! The Obamas were married before their children were born, and a baby mama is supposed to be someone who is the mother of your baby but not your spouse. (This is beginning to remind us of the time we tried to explain to our mother what it means to "get your swerve on.")  Malkin points out that Michelle once referred to Obama as her “baby’s daddy” when he won his Senate seat, but the “she can say it, why can’t I say it?” excuse never really holds water, does it? There is a lot of slang out there which suddenly becomes inappropriate when co-opted by another group.  So was it a calculated move intended to demean Michelle Obama or just an ignorant and unfortunate use of rhyming? Fox News issued this statement today from Bill Shine, senior vice-president of programming for Fox News Channel: "A producer on the program exercised poor judgment in using this chyron during the segment." It will be interesting to see how the Obama camp responds to this because Michelle can’t really get offended without potentially alienating the baby-mama contingent (a fairly large group considering almost 40 percent of all American children are born out of wedlock). “What’s wrong with being a ‘baby mama’?” they could ask. “What are you trying to imply?” And one would be wise not to mess with the baby mamas. They spend a lot of time disciplining children and can be most fierce. —Noelle Hancock Fox News Calls Michelle Obama “Obama’s Baby Mama” [Salon] FDA Says ‘Parmesan’ Cheese Might Actually Be Cheddar or Wood Pulp How Hillary Clinton Won Harlem U.S. Marshals Are Arresting People in Texas Who Have Outstanding Student Loans Adele Took Her Son to Disneyland in an Anna Costume and Is the Coolest Mom Ever Crazy Nut Donald Trump Thinks George W.

The state is one signature away from keeping transgender students out of restrooms for the gender they identify with. Some feel it’s bad for the party, though they have no intention of seeing Obama’s nominee confirmed. He keeps dodging on this important campaign issue. But it kinda seems like the president wants Trump to be the nominee. Copyright © 2016, New York Media LLC. All Rights Reserved.

Whatever Fox News Would Like To Take a Moment To Remind You That the Obamas Are As Black As Satan’s Festering, Baby-Eating Soul Post navigation I'M STUCK WITH A VALUABLE FRIEND 
			336 thoughts on “Fox News Would Like To Take a Moment To Remind You That the Obamas Are As Black As Satan’s Festering, Baby-Eating Soul”		 WHATEVER Whatever Days Whatarchives Administrivia The Big Idea Whatever Everyone Else is Saying Whatwitter Whatever Just Happened  The Name of My Next Band Random Whatever Scalzi Elsewhere on the Internet Share:  Back in the day — you know, when presidential candidates were respectably white — news organizations called potential First Ladies “wives.” But now that black folks are running, we can get all funky fresh with the lingo, yo. So it’s basically fine for Fox News to use “Baby Mama” for Michelle Obama, slang that implies a married 44-year-old Princeton-educated lawyer is, to use an Urban Dictionary definition of the term, “some chick you knocked up on accident during a fling who you can’t stand but you have to tolerate cuz she got your baby now.” Because the Obamas are black! And the blacks, they’re all relaxed about that shit, yo. Word up. And anyway, as the caption clearly indicates, it’s not Fox News that’s calling Michelle Obama “Baby Mama,” it’s outraged liberals. Fox News is just telling you what those outraged liberals are saying. They didn’t want to use the term “Baby Mama.” But clearly they had no choice. Meanwhile, over at her personal site, Michelle “Fox News’ Ethnic Shield” Malkin defends Fox News’ use of the “Baby Mama” phrase by essentially making two arguments. First, Michelle Obama once called Barack Obama her “baby’s daddy,” and as we all know, a married woman factually and correctly calling her husband her child’s father is exactly the same as a major news organization calling a potential First Lady some chick what got knocked up on a fling. Second, the term “baby-daddy” has gone out into the common culture; heck, even Tom Cruise was called Katie Holmes’ baby-daddy, you know, when he impregnated her and she subsequently gave birth while the two were not married, which is exactly like what happened between Michelle and Barack Obama, who were married in 1992 and whose first child was born six years later. So by Malkin’s reasoning it’s perfectly fine for Fox News to call Michelle Obama the unmarried mother of Barack Obama’s children because an entirely different phrase has to her mind entered the common culture, and there was this one time that Michelle Obama once uttered something that sounded like that entirely different phrase, which is not the phrase that Fox News used. But wait! Malkin also points to someone in her comment thread saying that one time, Michelle Obama actually used the phrase “baby daddy”! No apostrophe! It’s in a comment thread, so it must be true. Therefore, Michelle Obama apocryphally using a piece of urban slang makes it perfectly okay for Fox News to use an entirely different piece of urban slang. And that’s why, you see, it won’t be a problem for Bill O’Reilly to refer to Barack Obama as “my nigga” on the next O’Reilly Factor. It’s shit like this that makes this story on CNN, about whether Barack Obama should be considered black or biracial, an absolute hoot. Here’s a quick test on whether Obama should be considered fully black: Poof! Barack Obama has been magically transported to a KKK meeting in deepest, whitest Klanistan without his Secret Service detail. There’s a rope and a tree nearby. What happens to Obama? If you say, “why, Barack Obama walks out of there alive, of course” then sure, he’s biracial. Also, you’re a fucking idiot. To everybody who cares about Obama’s racial identity, either positively or negatively, the man is a black man, married to a black woman, who has black children. Black black black black black black black black. It sure as hell matters to Fox News, which is why it’s dog whistling about Barack so loudly that it’s vibrating the windows. Calling Michelle Obama a “baby mama” isn’t just Fox News having a happy casual larf; it’s using urban slang to a) remind you the Obamas are black, b) belittle a woman of considerable personal accomplishment, and c) frame Barack Obama’s relationship to his wife and children in a way that insults him, minimizes his love for and commitment to his family, and reinforces stereotypes about black men. Someone at Fox News just ought to call Barack Obama “boy” at some point so we can have all the cards right out there on the table. This will keep happening. Fox News will keep finding ways to remind its viewers that the Obamas are black (and possibly Muslim), Michelle Malkin will continue to make excuses for Fox News’ dog-whistling racism that expose the fact that she’s about as familiar with logical thinking as a rainbow trout is with knitting, and eventually some portion of the Fox News audience will get to the ballot box in November convinced that they’re not really racists, they just know that there’s something about that Obama boy they just don’t like. This is how it will go. Let’s not pretend it’s not part of equation, this election year. Wow.  Has there been any reaction on the part of the Obamas’ yet?  ‘Cause frankly, if it were me, I’d be sending my attack-dog PR flacks after Fox news over this. Y’know, I really have difficulty processing how fscked up it is that it actually, y’know, seems important to some people that A) Obama’s black and B) Hillary was a woman.  Maybe it’s because I grew up with Maggie Thatcher in power or something, but it’s just hair-rippingly distressing that such utter, inconsequential non-issues seem to be so vastly important to some people. *sighs* The hell? I can’t keep up. Just got done with making fun of the last Fox Pas… Fox News Guide to Terrorist Gang Signs
http://www.alexwilson.com/projects/journal/foxnews_guide_to_terrorist_gang_signs.php You, sir, are my hero yet again. Also, I predict the Malkinites will descend on this thread by comment number 14. Because, you know, when I think of teh blacks, I think Muslims!  Everyone knows that black people were imported as slaves from Mesopotamia (Eye-rack for you rednecks out there in the audience)!  Of course, how does “baby mamma” apply then, if they’re like the “Eye-rackies” because we all know that Muslim women can’t be seen in public or have sex outside of marriage on account of how they hate freedom! Are there any other bad stereotypes I’m forgetting to include? The stupid!  It BURNS! And “Outraged liberals: Stop picking on Obama’s baby mama” also sounds like something from Jerry Springer. So they win double points with their audience. Sigh. Oh John, you had me at “Word up.” And the blacks, they’re all relaxed about that shit, yo. They be all relaxed about that shit.  Dang, don’t nobody learn grammar these days? @ Scalzi: Yeah.  You’re right. Christ on a cracker… I knew we would see the ugly side of racist twits once Obama got the nod, but that just takes the cake. I hope the Obama’s do respond, as this is just unacceptable even with what passes for journalism these days. I’ve linked back to you on my WordPress, and I tip my hat to you for this article. “I want you  to get up right now, go the window, open it, stick your head out and yell, ‘I’m as black as hell and I’m not going to take this anymore’.” Being an Australian, and not really following the US election, US slang or Fox news, I have to say that on a purely aesthetic level, I like the euphonious matching of “Obama” and “mama”. Obama’s black?!  I had no idea!  Why didn’t someone TELL ME?  Here I was just assuming he had a really great tan.  In January. I’m still so amazed that people actually care whether Obama is black or not… I’m more concerned that I think his health policy is crap. Of course, it’s less crap than McCain’s. I’m over 40 and I don’t care about race or sex. I have just registered as a Democrat for the first time in 22 years and at this point, I might vote for a Martian. To be fair, I actually think McCain is pretty moderate. But, he is two Presidential terms too late. I’m a little concerned about Obama’s views toward Israel, but not enough to one issue vote the other way. Really, where is this LCD that Fox is aiming at? Do they actually know how to vote? Fox News and other right-wing mouthpieces are getting desperate to stay relevant in this election year.  I don’t think Fox will survive the summer if they keep up with this inane and childish bullshit.  I mean, you go from that brainless moppet E.D. Hill’s gibberish about a “terrorist fist jab,” to this, and it’s clear Fox is nothing more than a cult of incompetent, unabashed frauds doing their damnedest to pretend that they’re journalists. … Michelle Malkin will continue to make excuses for Fox News’ dog-whistling racism that expose the fact that she’s about as familiar with logical thinking as a rainbow trout is with knitting… I’m just going to savor that phrase. You are right, of course.  Fox News = Spew-inducing disinformation. Thanks for the brilliant rant.  I’ve recently sworn off all 24-hour “news” networks, and this sort of nonsense (and Chris Matthews in general) is precisely the reason why. “I don’t think Fox will survive the summer if they keep up with this inane and childish bullshit” Why would this summer be any different?  This is the same inane crap they’ve been spewing since the start. You really ought to put warning labels on rants that are this funny.  This entire thing should be labeled as a choking hazard. I’d also subscribe you your newsletter, but since I’m already reading your blog, that would be needlessly redundant. In closing, well said, and thank you for this. …and yet again the advancement of the human race is stumped by morphological divergence. I want a refund. I can’t decide if this outrages me to the point where I should start a letter-writing campaign, or if it’s so inane and transparent it just deserves a head shake and a rueful chuckle. Either way, the logical fallacies in use by Fox News are just…stunning. Richard on 12 Jun 2008 at 12:15 pm I’d also subscribe you your newsletter, but since I’m already reading your blog, that would be needlessly redundant. You wouldn’t be saying that if the newsletter subscriptions came with free mittens knitted by trout. Well, I must say Fox is certainly making it easy for its detractors to go all foamy. Now if we could just generate this level of outrage when seated politicians call our soldiers murderers and terrorists… I have to admit I was unfamiliar with the cultural connotations of “baby mama,” so I had to look it up. I’ve been using “…” to visually indicate me opening and closing my mouth, being unable to come up with something to say.  I seem to be doing it more and more frequently, of late. Do you know the worst thing about all this crap? The fact that you’ve still got several MORE months of it to go till it’s over. And by ‘over’ I mean till the months upon months of coverage of Florida’s electoral stuff up starts in the aftermath of the presidential result.
(Come-on, you just know that Florida is gonna screw-the-pooch and mess it up for everyone) sigh…MM and Fox news:  Idiots in a handbasket. This really outrages me.  I hate the words Baby Mama.  It’s stupid and NO ONE SHOULD BE CALLED THEM.  Not Michelle Obama NO ONE.  It implies they can’t think for themselves.  That they are incapable.  It’s not true and insanely degrading. Some one called Nancy Reagan “eye candy” a few weeks ago.  It makes me just as upset. These woman are brave enough to stand by their husbands while this **** is flung.  They deserve more. Michelle: This is why Krissy has forbidden me from running for President. She wants no part of that sort of nonsense. Dang.  I thought they would attack his experience first.  Good thing I didn’t bet on that. I’m a conservative and Fox News irks the hell out of me a lot of the time.  “Fair and balanced” is a load of crap – I really wish that media outlets (and not just Fox, btw) would actually recognize and present their biases.  That way, those folks that don’t scrounge around for news would at least be aware that, in fast, the news they’re watching has an angle to it. To my mind, there is no such thing as an unbiased, neutral opinion.  The best we can hope for as consumers of information is to understand the biases of our sources for that information, and then synthesize conclusions from multiple sources representing a broad spectrum of bias. As to the ‘Baby Mama’ thing… perhaps they thought they were making a fluffy joke, or perhaps not… either way, without a direct quote from one of the ‘outraged liberals’, that choice of terminology is pretty tasteless & unprofessional. Back to my TV motto: “Every time I watch television I remember why I don’t watch television.” Anny Mouse: Well, see. He can explain away his lack of experience. But he can’t explain away being black. Brian: “To my mind, there is no such thing as an unbiased, neutral opinion.” Indeed not. What one does hope for is a bit of common sense. Fox News isn’t the only news org that flubs up, but they do seem to continue to flub up consistently in the same direction. I hope Senator Obama says this:  “If the Right Wing Propaganda Machine wants to engage in a debate over the candidates personal Family Values and devotion to the sanctity of marriage… well, that’s a debate I’m happy to have with John McCain!” I’m just picturing the mayhem Krissy would visit upon Fox News.  Oh, the smiting!  Oh, the (sorta) humanity! Did anyone read Thomas Friedman’s oped yesterday?
http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/opinion/11friedman.html?em&ex=1213416000&en=4bde3fcf7058b1b0&ei=5087
Other people in the world think we have gotten past this type of stuff, because Mr Obama is the presumptive nominee.  I guess that’s wishful thinking on their part. Fox, The Washington Times, and other such “unbiased media” remind me why my primary news sources are the BBC and NPR. Fox “News” doesn’t make mistakes.  It’s all done intentionally.  It’s the new racism by which conservatives hide their racism behind being “fair” and then they claim they are being persecuted when their racism is called out. I’ve been wondering of late whether we should re-institute preconditions for democratic participation.  Rather than the plutocratic or just plain discriminatory prerequisites of race or land-holding, we should introduce some test for 1) appreciation of uncertainty; and 2) ability to make one’s own mind up.  That is to say, you ask someone: 1) have you ever been wrong? and 2) did hearing two sides of an argument sway you from a previous belief to a new one?  (I am totally not serious about this, but bear with me) Fox News frequently panders to folks who believe – strongly – in one particular set of values, and the use of baby mama simply reinforces some deeply held, uncontested beliefs of a subset of the viewership of the channel.  Telling that group that baby mama is demeaning and inappropriate would be like telling the national enquirer to use a little more tact in their reporting.  Plus, you might get a knee-jerk ‘I hate PC’ response. The lack of critical thinking is an epidemic that has swept America over the last several years, and we need to bring people together who are good critical thinkers to really hash out issues and work on raising everybody up, rather than lowering us down.  I’d like to work my reptilian brain into submission, rather than submitting to it. I should note that this issue exists on the left, right, up and down perspectives.  Even the objectivists get frothy about a few things :) Personally I hope that Fox should should go even further.
Perhaps by refering to Obama from now on as “Da Pimp”. And Michelle as “His Ho”.
PLEASE FOX. SHOW THE US AND THE WORLD YOUR RIGHT WING RACIST REPORTING TACTICS!
It will *ONLY* put the Republican party to deeper shame and when “Da Pimp” and “His Ho” become the President of the US in November it will be these STUPID ASS Fox News reporters who will be swinging from the trees by a noose.
Hopefully by suicide…
/end rant. GOD I HATE IGNORANCE! John, thanks.  I’m really, really busy at work today, you’re a better writer than I, and this is excellent.  Now I can just link to you and not stress about my own blog entry on the subject. Actually one of the things I like about Senator Obama is that he usually doesn’t get all excited about these issues and takes the time to make a calm, deliberate and pointed response. John, an excellent political post, as usual.  What is so enjoyable about the Obama / McCain race is watching the wheels come off Fox.  Fox was clearly pushing for a Clinton/Gulianni match up and they are still spluttering about in shock that the people (even the conservative people) did not hove to.  It has reduced them to base instincts like this and the equally classic “terroist fist bump” comment from last week.  Equally fun to see Oberman beat O’Rileys rating for the first time.  Maybe people are waking up…. Whoa, Obama has a black child? No way! Sometimes I wonder if Stephen Colbert is moonlighting as a writer for Fox News.  Nothing else makes sense.  People can’t be that dumb, right?  And still feed themselves and remember to breathe? Gee, Thanks, Fox News! Lovely bit of irony…I just flipped over to CNN.com for no good reason and what do I see? The first headline in the Latest News section: “Michelle Obama may face jabs in election fight” No, really? You think? Now, in the interests of fairness and balance Faux should adopt my pet name for Cindy McCain – Crackhead Barbie. OK, she wasn’t addicted to crack, she was addicted to pain pills.  That she stole from a children’s charity.  But she did rehab instead of jail time because… because… she’s Cindy McCain. I love you. Deeply. In a transitory, thank goodness someone has a clue way, but no less sincere for that. I think it’s just suppossed to be a catchy phrase. Say it out loud. It rhymes. I agree that it should never have been said but really aren’t there bigger fish to fry? The media is trying to dumb down politics to fit within the writing style of People or Us Magazines. It’s a good thing his last name is Obama and not Obigger. I can see the cover stories now How old does McCain look in this picture? See Rachel Ray’s new fashion don’t! Exclusive interview with Obama’s Baby Mama! Here is my philosophy. If you are intelligent to realize how offensive, biased, and ridiculous 24 hour news stations are (both CNN and Fox News) don’t watch them… I’m just disappointed that they settled for the phrase “picking on” when they could have used the more euphonius “hating on.” My head just exploded. No, really. It did.
After working in a newsroom and having my heart broken during the last election, I’ve been avoiding most of the election coverage this time around. At least until, yanno, we’re within sniffing distance of the actual day. What I think pisses most of us off is that crap like this happens, and then no one gets called on it–as if the powers that be (in either camp) think that ignoring the problem will make it go away, or that acknowleging it gives it power. Like in 2000: McCain had a black baby!? Well, you know, that was just all in good fun/part of the election process (heh heh). And Johnnie boy rolled over and let the Republican party rub his belly and make nice. And *that* is exactly why I lost all respect for the man. The best thing for Obama to do? Call them on this bullshit. Calling people on their crap freaks bullies out. And if there is one thing this country needs, it’s some honesty and for the bullies to be spanked for being such asshats. Rant over. “If you are intelligent to realize how offensive, biased, and ridiculous 24 hour news stations are (both CNN and Fox News) don’t watch them…” Well, yes, but where to go after them?  I stopped reading MSNBC.com a while ago and was using the New York Times homepage for Firefox start, but then there’s: “Brian:
‘To my mind, there is no such thing as an unbiased, neutral opinion.” Indeed not. What one does hope for is a bit of common sense. Fox News isn’t the only news org that flubs up, but they do seem to continue to flub up consistently in the same direction.'” (John, up above) I generally agree that there’s no such thing as unbiased, neutral opinion, no matter how objective a news story might read (because one must also consider that story choice itself reveals biases), but then, what now?  Fox is awful, CNN not much better, MSNBC amateurish at best, Olbermann’s jumped the shark . . . I mean it comes a point you have to look up and notice that the best news show out there is The Daily Show, and where does that leave journalism? I’ve heard the BBC is a good news source. Great rant. Worthy of Lewis Black (heh). And so, it begins……….. If we’re (when I say we, I mean you, as I’m a Brit, but as your current Prez took his lapdog Tony and our country into a war, I feel the love) lucky, they’ll keep this level of ordure up, and drive any undecided middle-of-the-road voters into the baby-daddy’s arms. Here’s hoping. Krissy is one smart woman.  You should make sure you thank her again after this.  :) I dunno, Krissy has a baseball bat and isn’t afraid to use it.  Maybe she should send it to Michelle Obama. I’d love to say I’m surprised by this but I’m not and truthfully, the Obama’s probably aren’t either. Really, for a whole lot of Black folks who made it into institutes of higher learning and beyond, this is just one more round of “how dare you be up in here with us?”  The slings and arrows are just that but it’s not the first time that these things will be said, nor will it be the last. The words are hurtful and if you confronted most of these folks with their stupid head on, all they’ll do is fall back on “well, Black people (i.e. rappers) say this stuff all the time, so why can’t we?”  At which point, I’ll roll my eyes and point them to the door because you can’t fight that kind of stupid with logic. Rainbow trout and knitting?  Nope.  But perch are widely regarded not only for their knitting skills, as well as crocheting.  They make the cutest tea cozies. *gives standing ovation* I can understand in the arena of 24 hour news that the demand for quantity trumps quality. I can also understand the surge of extremely biased reporting when your network counts on branded headline repetition in boosting advertising revenue. I choose not to watch Fox because of these facts. Likewise, I could have thrown my shoe at a CNN anchor who was extremely excited about fresh flood footage. He was grinning from ear to ear as he described the total annihilation of a house being thrown into a river. What incenses me the most about this particular case is the pure lack of respect for another member of the human race. This has nothing to do with being “politically correct.” This is a violation of basic human courtesy. The minute something directly linked or representative with negative connotation becomes socially acceptable as a label or generalization, is the moment the social fabric of our civilization starts to unravel. Rudeness begets rude as idiocy breeds idiots. Fox has proven themselves as a serious contender of both. Faux News strikes again . . . Scalzi for TEH WIN!i!i!i You are once again proven the master of insight in the Blogosphere.  You are, sir, my hero for your takedown of the “OMFG he’s BLACK! BLACKITY-BLACK-BLACK-BLACK!!!” conservative meme. God, that’s just disgusting. It’s obviously intended to push as many “liberal” buttons as possible… and Malkin’s just going to keep digging that hole for them. Fair and balanced, my ass. Where’s their coverage insulting Mrs. McCain? I guess nothing to cover, since she’s boring and unremarkable and not black. Fucking disingenous bigoted muppets. When I saw that screenshot, I thought it just HAD to be Photoshopped. It couldn’t be real. But it looks like I just underestimated Fox News’ capacity for crassness. Even if the brain-damaged chimpanzees playing editors at Fox News honestly had no idea just how much of an insult it is to refer to an accomplished and MARRIED woman as anyone’s “baby mama,” you’d think they would have some inkling that the phrase has no place on a news program, except maybe a satirical one. (That said, I’m hoping to see some reference to this fiasco in the next issue of The Onion, because that will make me feel much better.) I am really pissed. Barack Obama is the first black man in history to become an American presidential candidate, and for that he gets a pack of yahoos throwing ghetto slang at his wife. Hail, F*cking hail! Holy crap!  O_o  How do hey get away with this shit these days??? I’m going to copy this whole thing to my LiveJournal (giving proper credit for awesome blogging and linking back here.) if you don’t mind.  I missed this – and it should be put out there. …had someone sent this to Jon Stewart?  ::evil grin:: You’re my freakin’ hero, John. Oh, and Fox issued a statement saying that the program’s producer used “poor judgement”. REALLY!?  YA THINK!? *rollseyes* D.Paul on 12 Jun 2008 at 3:16 pm Rainbow trout and knitting? Nope. But perch are widely regarded not only for their knitting skills, as well as crocheting. They make the cutest tea cozies. And, let’s not overlook the many contributions of the Walleye population to the world of auto-mechanics and gardening (though, the carp were the ones who started the whole topiary craze). Really, man.  Freshwater fish just don’t get the credit they deserve.  And, it’s unfortunate that John would judge all fish merely on the actions of a few god damned lazy trout. Dilemma: Should I continue to watch The Colbert Report… or switch to Fox “News”? Which is the biggest parody?
:-S Fox News Channel isn’t news at all. It’s a propaganda outlet with very specific goals in mind. One word, everyone: Truthiness. These tactics “the baby mama” and “the terrorist fist jab” are all part of a smoke screen to get us on the subject of race and away from talking about the economy, the war, energy, and health care. Once that discussion begins- game over! Thanks for the great rant. It wasn’t Fox, but Obama’s already been called boy. This is just a distraction!
I’ve never known Fox News to do anything like this before!
This is not the Fox News I knew! Reason #umpteen why I haven’t watched television news in two years. But I wrote an email to News Corp anyway, what the heck. It’s Fox News – whaddya ‘spect? Don’t ‘spect no R-E-S-P-E-C-T from the disrespectable. I’m trying to decide whether this or the “terrorist fist jab” is better. I’m leaning toward this just because it came out of a PoC’s mouth. John Scalzi: This is why Krissy has forbidden me from running for President. She wants no part of that sort of nonsense. This is why I’d vote Krissy for President.  If she were running.  You want to be First Dude? You could shave your head again. Plus, she has a baseball bat and knows what to do with one. #41:  “Sometimes I wonder if Stephen Colbert is moonlighting as a writer for Fox News. Nothing else makes sense. People can’t be that dumb, right? And still feed themselves and remember to breathe?” Oh my goodness.  That has to be it!! How could I have missed that it’s just a news spoof?? #63:  “Freshwater fish just don’t get the credit they deserve. ” And salt water fish do?  LOL Ryan on 12 Jun 2008 at 5:22 pm I’ve never known Fox News to do anything like this before!
This is not the Fox News I knew! You’re kidding, right? It’s so hard to tell these days. today, you’re the angry black woman, John, because i can’t even begin to approach this bullshit without killing a puppy. That’s a lot of black. Aunty Beeb has some inherent problems of it’s own, and not just with it’s news coverage if I’m honest.  I’ll watch it, but I tend to prefer our (the UK that is) Channel 4 News. For a start, it’s an hour long, not 30 minutes, so instead of a 5 minute piece by some bloke sat in a studio the other side of the planet, you get quite a fair bit of information about a subject, not just a 5 minute precis about what some journalist learnt while he was buying a scotch in the airport bar.  Also, they do appear to try and not take sides, but this may just be me wishing that on it. Having said that, if any news channel broadcast a strap-line like that in this country, they’d immediately have about 1,000 complaints to Ofcom, who actually have the teeth to do something about it.  From what I understand, the US communications watchdog appears to only be interested in the odd flash of boob during a ‘Football’ (commas used, ‘cos it’s not real football ;-) match, or other stuff seen by anyone who’s ever been breastfed, or had sex for that matter. I don’t think of Obama as black.  More like The Mocha Messiah. Bets on which Faux talking head is the first to use the N-word? I think there is a bigger question here we are all missing. Does Michelle Malkin have a serious self-hatred thing going on? Todd Stull: No. It’s entirely possible the amount of racism she’s encountered in her life is minimal, especially as the rare bird she is: an attractive, reasonably articulate conservative woman of color, which makes her valuable to the conservative cause and has undoubtedly smoothed her way professionally. Why should she have self-hatred? Being an attractive conservative woman of color has opened lots of doors for her, I suspect. Oh crap there go the Simpsons.  The only Fox network show allowed in this house has been the Simpsons, but I can’t, in good conscience, provide that network with anything resembling support.  Since I use digital cable they are monitoring use; so bye by Marge…sob. I hope that this will be a topic on CNN’s Sunday “Reliable Sources”. It will be quite humorous to see someone try to defend the use of “Baby Mama”. George The whole tired “Michelle Obama once said baby’s daddy” defense that Michelle Malkin is trying to use is ridiculous. I mean, Michelle Obama might have called her husband “honey” at some point, does that mean Fox News will start calling him that to? Hey, Skar #24 — can you give me an example of when that happened?  I must have missed it. Was it one of those cases where one of our soldiers was was up on charges for murder?  ‘Cause, mainly, I’d be okay with people who were murderers who happened to ALSO be soldiers to be called murderers. Fox News is always the perfect recipe if I want indigestion and seething rage.  And CNN hired Glenn Beck.  People are stupid. But how cool and amazing it would be if Obama could win, with fucktards like these.  I want to hope, but I don’t want to be dashed again.. It took me a couple of paragraphs to realize how angry you were about this (and then properly chastised myself  for this lapse in cognitive awareness as a Whatever veteran). And I loved how you proceeded to call Fox News out on their total absolute BS. Thank You! John Scalzi wrote: “It sure as hell matters to Fox News, which is why it’s dog whistling about Barack so loudly that it’s vibrating the windows.” Yeah, but Fox is whistling out it’s @$$. Which is why I stopped being a broadcast reporter in 1990, and have never looked back. Well, thank the gods that Michelle Obama wasn’t wearing a frilly scarf at the time they took that file footage. Michelle Malkin’s head might have spun right off. I mean, it is detachable and all. She seems to leave it at home all the time. I really like the pure sarcasm employed in your writing. Obama has the Fight the Smears web site. And there’s the Michelle Obama Watch site people can contribute to as well. They can’t very well talk about ISSUES now because they don’t have a leg to stand on. I hope the Obamas ban Fixed Noise from here on out. That had to be one of the most hateful rants I’ve read yet this election year.  I shouldn’t be surprised though that you secular-progressive socialists, borderline communists, smear tacticians continue to defame everything about Fox News.  You complain that Fox News is the right-wing news channel…blah blah blah.  Okay, so the conservatives have one tv channel that leans their way.  Liberals control the rest of them.  I am willing to bet the majority of the people commenting on this blog have never even watched Fox News long enough to form their own opinion (not one derived from someone else you heard talking about Fox News) about their reporting.  I’ve watched them all, even Obama’s HQ over there at MSNBC and from what I’ve seen, Fox News may lean a little right, but they are closer to being fair than any of the rest I’ve seen this election year.  So, I encourage all of you liberals and conservatives (I doubt there is many on this site) to mix it up a bit and watch Fox News for a few days to see a different perspective.  There must be an awful lot of truth reported on Fox News for you to hate them so much, John.  I bet you’re not too good at poker are you? Oh, and John, we don’t need Fox News to subliminally suggest Obama is black by reporting on outraged liberals crying that Michelle Obama is being picked on.  I can see with my own eyes that he is black and guess what, I don’t care.  I’m not going to not vote for Obama because he’s black.  I’m not going to vote for him because his answer to fixing the economy is to raise taxes.  I’m not going to vote for him because he wants to disarm America.  I’m not going to vote for him because he wants to ration our food and energy consumption.  I’m not going to vote for him because he wants to subject us to taxation by the U.N.  I’m not going to vote for him because he wants to surrender Iraq to Al Qaeda and Iran.  I’m not going to vote for him because he demonstrated very poor judgment for a politician with aspirations of running for President by associating himself with known communists, racists and terrorists.  But I say again, I’m not going to not vote for Obama because he is black. Token conservative done ranting now. Charles: “That had to be one of the most hateful rants I’ve read yet this election year.” Get out more, Charles. Also, re: “token conservative,” there are lots of conservatives who visit and comment here, and rather more substantively and with fewer rote talking point cliches than you just have, so please get over yourself. Your problem is not that you’re conservative, it’s that your comment is unoriginal, boring and lame. Other conservatives here do better in their arguments. Strive to emulate them. John, You call it cliche, I call it truth.  Very typical of a liberal to sling insults to attempt to make a point.  What is unoriginal, boring and lame is the secular-progressive agenda Obama is attempting to push this election year.  It’s all been done before and failed miserably.  I know, that was cliche according to you isn’t it?  Of course it is.  Anything that is too close to the truth you will just dismiss it as cliche.  The more Obama defines his “Change” message, the more of the old school socialist agenda will be revealed.  I’m sorry, did I say socialist?  I meant to say progressive.  That is what you liberals call it these days right?  No need to respond, I know the answer already. Charles: “You call it cliche, I call it truth.” Of course you do, Charles. That’s the pity of it. Run along now, Charles, and let people who can actually think without the help of pre-printed index cards do what they were doing before you got here. Charles @ #92: Ok, if that was meant to be sarcasm, you need to kick it up a notch, ’cause it really didn’t come across that way. Of course, it is wasn’t meant to be sarcasm, then you have just scared the f*ck out of me, ’cause it terrifies me that someone presumably intelligent can actually believe lines like Okay, so the conservatives have one tv channel that leans their way. Liberals control the rest of them. and ’ve watched them all, even Obama’s HQ over there at MSNBC and from what I’ve seen, Fox News may lean a little right, but they are closer to being fair than any of the rest I’ve seen this election year. A little right!?! And they say that the Brits are masters of understatement. *boggles* I’m also deeply curious just how a government is supposed to supply all the services it is supposed to, like, say, Defense, law enforcement, and roads, without collecting taxes? But then, I’m an Australian, and somewhat left-leaning even by Aussie standards, so by your lights, I guess that makes me as good as a communist. Charles @ 94, and the “compassionate conservative” agenda has done SO MUCH for our country….. two wars, record oil prices, failing schools, the housing crisis, the health care crisis (yes, it is a crisis when so many uninsured are using the emergency rooms for basic care) and the shredding of the constitution (torture, loss of privacy…..) Yeah, we really need four more years of that. Don’t feed the troll, Fiona. ;-) But…but the troll missed the “I bet you won’t let this comment out of moderation” that is the hallmark of the true wingnut rant! Damn, John, you need to work on your quality control around here. Why should she have self-hatred? Being an attractive conservative woman of color has opened lots of doors for her, I suspect. It’s also a very comfortable niche to be a conservative ‘rare bird’ who craps on all the other birds. The list of conservative women who have made their fortune being “the only girl in the room” is a fairly long one. Malkin adds being a minority, and the cachet that gives her to crap on other minorities, to her resume. The powers-that-be are very good to their pets who don’t let anyone else into the kennel. Can’t say I’m surprised, it being FoxNews and all. Anyway, brilliantly written. Great breakdown of the inherent absurdity in the various attempts to “explained away” FoxNews’ little stunt thus far. Well done. Ha!    John – posts like this aren’t likely to net you one of those Instalanches. I think Jaydog has it right… See, I always thought Baby Mama meant teenage mother.  That would be a little weird if his wife was a teenager.  In fact, that would probably bother me some. @ 94, Charles who is not in Charge, sez: ” I’m not going to vote for him because he wants to surrender Iraq to Al Qaeda and Iran.” Oh Charles, can’t you do better than parroting Glen Beck?  (Oh wait, he’s a LIBERAL because he’s not on Fox, right?) You’re apparently too clueless to understand that your own Republican ditto-masters have already handed Iraq on a platter to Iran.  But O’Reilly-wannabes like yourself don’t know a damned thing about the region — as long as you keep getting American soldiers killed there, you’re satisfied. See, to Republicans it really doesn’t matter if a foreign occupation actually benefits the security of the U.S.A.  If it was actual security we wanted, there were hundreds of better ways to attain that for HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. But you like death.  You like seeing our soldiers killed. All of you Republicans, most of you cowardly chickenhawks yourselves, love seeing our soldiers die. As long as our soldiers are getting killed and wounded there, and a TRILLION of our hard-earned tax dollars are get wasted to prop up an Iran-friendly government, you and your chickenhawk buttboys are happy as clams. Traitor. Your ability to stick to Fox News more than makes up for your terrible abilities at Fantasy Football. I think Obama should announce that he is “cutting ties” with Fox News (a la Jim Johnson earlier this week)…He can’t be associated with a news organization like that… DavisDem: There’s a reason my fantasy football team was called “The Mediocre Walloons,” you know. Scalzi, you’ve been picked up by the progressive blogosphere! Oh, noes!!! Your conservative cover has been blown…. http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/6/13/02320/2993/821/535140 I’ve been whispering to my friends that hey, did you know that Barack Obama had TWO children by a … BLACK woman? … for months, to good effect.  And here Michelle frigging MALKIN has to go and screw up the joke forever. I swear, what they’re really trying to do is destroy satire as a form of humor. Alex: Heh. This should be fun. It’s shit like this that makes this story on CNN, about whether Barack Obama should be considered black or biracial, an absolute hoot. Here’s a quick test on whether Obama should be considered fully black: Poof! Barack Obama has been magically transported to a KKK meeting in deepest, whitest Klanistan without his Secret Service detail. There’s a rope and a tree nearby. What happens to Obama? If you say, “why, Barack Obama walks out of there alive, of course” then sure, he’s biracial. Also, you’re a fucking idiot. To everybody who cares about Obama’s racial identity, either positively or negatively, the man is a black man, married to a black woman, who has black children. Black black black black black black black black. scalzi, you say a lot of ignorant things about race, but this really takes the cake. what makes you think that YOU, or anyone else for that matter, gets to decide what obama’s race is? that’s for obama to decide. period. and he’s not telling. you may THINK he’s telling, but he’s actually CAMPAIGNING. he’s not telling because of people like you, who don’t get the whole multiracial thing, and would be suspicious of a person who insisted on his multiraciality, the way everybody was suspicious of tiger woods until he started winning everything in sight. everybody forgives a winner. and maybe once obama has won his second presidential race he’ll start talking about himself as a multiracial. until then, stop thinking you know everything about race. you don’t. and try googling “hypodescent” and “code switching.” oh yeah, and the KKK? what THEY think of obama’s race doesn’t count, either, if they actually still exist and aren’t just a scare tactic used to bury the common ignorance and everyday racism that obama ACTUALLY faces. oh, by the way, that was me with the angry comment above. i wasn’t trolling, just forgetful. claire: “scalzi, you say a lot of ignorant things about race, but this really takes the cake. what makes you think that YOU, or anyone else for that matter, gets to decide what obama’s race is?” Well, let me flip that around to you, claire: If I or anyone else for that matter, decide that Obama is black (or biracial, or white) for the purposes of how I respond to him, how are you or anyone else going to stop me (or them)? “stop thinking you know everything about race.’ I invite you, claire, to point to where I have suggested I know everything about race. I’m not aware of making such a statement. I also invite you, claire, to kiss my ass, as far as telling me what I can or can’t do, either in my thoughts or how I choose to express them on my own site. Imagine what would happen if Michelle Obama wore a paisley scarf! not much of an argument there, scalzi. here’s some homework for you, for the next time you try to be intelligent about obama: http://www.racialicious.com/ claire: “not much of an argument there, scalzi.” Well, claire, I work with what I’m given. Thanks for dropping by, claire. As ever, your condescension to me on racial matters makes you an absolute delight to have in these quarters. Dang, I guess now that I know he’s black I can’t vote for him, I was sorta hoping no one would mention it, but it’s out in the open now…  Sad thing is I don’t even watch Fox….  Mr. Scalzi, you’ve got furthered Fox’s agenda:  Had you not mentioned this, I might have been saved! Well, I can say this much.  Miss Malkin, on at least two occasions, has eaten items at a restaurant which were definitely not on the menu, as it were. Honestly, I have no idea what that means. I’m not sure I want to know. Her food took a little longer to, uh, prepare than normal. Michelle Malkin’s a fussy eater? That explains everything. She is, actually. Fond of the Béchamel, is she? @123: Superb. Skar: Now if we could just generate this level of outrage when seated politicians call our soldiers murderers and terrorists… Indeed, it is well known that it’s a violation of physical law for American soldiers to murder or terrorize.  Americans are good. We know this because we learned it in kindergarten. That guy with the white hair who said that nationalism is an infantile disease was a real dummy. Charles: Token conservative done ranting now. I bet you go out with your wife wearing a T-shirt that says “she’s with stupid”. claire: scalzi, you say a lot of ignorant things about race, but this really takes the cake. what makes you think that YOU, or anyone else for that matter, gets to decide what obama’s race is? I sadly must inform you that a) you didn’t understand his argument and b) you have demonstrated yourself to be a morally corrupt individual by launching an ad hominem attack instead of a rebuttal. Well said, Mr. Scalzi. Well said, indeed! Well written, John. What’s more interesting–and puzzling–to me is that they apologized for it–the 3rd time in 3 weeks (heartening, because it means they’re *really* going off the rails). First it was Liz Trotta saying she’d like to see Obama assassinated, then E.D. Hill with the “terrorist fist jab, and now this. But this is FOX, and FOX, like any good conservative, *never* apologizes (c.f. Jesse Helms, 1993, calling for President Clinton’s assassination). I dunno. The best I can figure is that the people who advertise on Fox got afraid. (I was going to write “got spooked,” without realizing that, in this context, it might not be the best word choice.) And, yes, while I know I’m not supposed to feed the troll, I will note that nowhere in his talking points did Charlie actually attempt to defend the use of the phrase. Apostroph or no apostroph – wow! I know we here in Germany have problems with apostrophes (we call it “new spelling” and it’s the greatest cultural paradigm shift since Martin Luther), but FOX actually takes it to a higher level.
And I will not utter something more political in this thread … Looking at the screen grab, I’d say Malkin is blacker than Michelle Obama. BEST. HEADLINE. IN THE WORLD. claire-
He should address the fact he’s biracial! Just about EVERYBODY on the damn planet knows Obama’s half white and half Kenyan. I know this because a lieutenant in the Cambodian police force knows this. I want to thank your side for handing us the election. You make it easier every day. Your desperation is a thing of beauty and will provide months of hilarity. Hannah:”I’m hoping to see some reference to this fiasco in the next issue of The Onion, because that will make me feel much better.” I suspect that the people at The Onion are sadly shaking their heads at this and frustratedly muttering to each other, “Christ, how do we parody this? We’re gonna be out of jobs soon….” . Charles:
You complain that Fox News is the right-wing news channel…blah blah blah. Okay, so the conservatives have one tv channel that leans their way. Liberals control the rest of them. Funny, I must have missed MSNBC the day Laura was called “Bush’s Baby Mama”, or “Bush’s Bitch”. Or was it “Bush’s Bush”. I guess I also missed the day CNN brought in a body language expert to critique “Bush’s Terrorist Finger Jab”. Fox News may lean a little right, but they are closer to being fair than any of the rest […] I’m not going to not vote for Obama because he’s black. I’m not going to vote for him because his answer to fixing the economy is to raise taxes. I’m not going to vote for him because he wants to disarm America. I’m not going to vote for him because he wants to ration our food and energy consumption. I’m not going to vote for him because he wants to subject us to taxation by the U.N. I’m not going to vote for him because he wants to surrender Iraq to Al Qaeda and Iran. I’m not going to vote for him because he demonstrated very poor judgment for a politician with aspirations of running for President by associating himself with known communists, racists and terrorists. Oh, yeah, definitely a Fox News viewer. We can tell by the facts you get wrong, i.e. all of them. . Sorry, John, responded before reading the “Don’t feed the troll” warning at #98. Will try to be more careful in the future. . Mythago:
The list of conservative women who have made their fortune being “the only girl in the room” is a fairly long one. Somewhere in heaven, Yogi Berra is smiling – “Nobody goes there anymore, it’s too crowded.” . You know, I also read National Review. I try to listen to several sides of an argument… And it strikes me that Fox “News” gives conservatism a really bad name. It certainly wouldn’t hurt conservatives (or Republicans) to denounce the worst behavior of Fox “News.” (And some do. It’s not just Andrew Sullivan.) There are conservatives who like Barack Obama, who don’t automatically think in Campaign Mode (i.e. “Hillary Clinton is the ideal opponent to mobilize our base against” or “Let’s spread racist rumors in order to win”). Those of you who consider yourselves conservative, look into your hearts and ask yourselves: Is this right? Can I support this sort of behavior? That’s the only question you need to ask: Is this right? (Or, if you’re Christians: Would Jesus approve?) Well, as a 62 year old white male who grew up in Alabama in the middle of the Civil Rights movement, I have to tell you now have a new reader for your commentary. This is absolutely the most incisive body blow take down of the incredible racist propaganda of Faux Noise network on this particular instance I think I have read. You made front page of dailykos.com, which led me here. I would give you a thumbs up, but you might, of course, think I was a terrorist infiltrator. It’s gotten to the point where my brain has developed some sort of pattern recognition ability when it comes to Internet posts. If the post contains the initials “U.N.”, I instantly stop reading and file the entire thing under “Tinfoil Brigade”. I think the post is hilarious and spot on, but I disagree with the writer’s argument that Obama isn’t biracial or multiracial or part black and part white or whatever the term is for someone who has one parent of European heritage and another of African heritage. The example of Obama being transported to Klanistan is idiotic because even if Obama were able to prove to the folks about to lynch him that one of his parents was white, they’d hang him anyway for being miscegenated, a word I stole from Homer Stokes in “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” If the correct term for people of African descent who live in America is African American, than Obama is African European American or European African American. That doesn’t change the fact that his candidacy is historic or that bigots will consider him as African as Nelson Mandela; it’s just an accurate description of his heritage. I think a lot of people would howl, both in laughter and outrage, if Obama tried to deny his African heritage. (Not that he would.) Ignoring his European heritage doesn’t carry the same symbolic weight, to say the least, but it’s still wrong. You are a total asshole. JGabriel @136: Somewhere in heaven, Yogi Berra is smiling – “Nobody goes there anymore, it’s too crowded.” Actually, that should read “Somewhere in New Jersey.” Yogi is still very much alive. John,  I think he’s saying Michelle Malkin is a vampire.  I think she ate a bus boy. I’m a conservative. Love The Whatever. Don’t watch Fox News as much as I used to because, hey, I’d rather like a little less yellow spittle-fleck with my news, please. And Fox News deserves all the flak they get for the classlessness of the “baby mama” bit. The masks are already starting to come off the bigots, this one in Houston. http://www.khou.com/topstories/stories/khou080612_tnt_racistobamasign.27bc45a6.html Down here in Texas, I’m not surprised by such stupidity.  I’ve already heard one guy drop such pearls of wisdom in conversation as “That ‘boy’ [charming Southern word, that ‘boy’] better not come to Texas,” and “He’ll take the side of the Muslims in a holy war!”  My girlfriend’s landlord has said “That n—– will get shot if he wins.”  It’s just going to get so much worse, the closer we get to the election, especially if Obama holds on to his leads in the polls against McCain. You realize, of course, that from the day Obama takes office to the day he leaves, no Faux employee will be allowed within 500 feet of the White House fence, much less in the press room.  I’m still hoping for hate crime charges, if not incitement to riot. This is beautifully written…If I had Fox News ethics I’d steal it and use it on my own show… Hey, some rainbow trout are really excellent knitters! It would be really great if Obama showed up at a rally and said “Now let me introduce you to my Baby Mama.” While I don’t watch TV news, how much sway does FOX NEWS really have?  Isn’t it really just bias conformation?  How many independents watch FOX because the truly believe it’s “Fair and Balance”? Maybe it is an elaborate ruse to distract people from any really issues. I can’t help wondering what the foxes think of this. Then again… i’m with janiece. can’t decide whether to firebomb something or brush it off. the professional scholars group, the association of genocide scholars, years ago recommended not debating with genocide deniers. just sharing a venue with deniers — simply arguing with them — gives them the academic standing they lack and which they crave. there is a good point in that. what if we all stopped watching, and talking about, the video gasbags? do you really think they believe any of this and they’re not just hyping their ratings with scurrilities? On the whole “black/biracial” aspect – it’s that tension between self-identification and ascription that got Claire going, or so it seems to me. Of course the KKK would treat him as black.  And for political purposes, he’s going to be considered black.  Just like I’m considered white or Hispanic, even though I’m multiracial (Rosebud Sioux and Scottish). But that doesn’t negate the complexity of his racial identification.  He’s already acknowledged that he’s multiracial – but that’s not going to get him very far in the simplistic American world of racial categorization.  So, yeah, he’s black – but remember that’s a not-very-accurate label for who he is, necessitated by immediate circumstance. Don’t get me wrong – I think the rest of your commentary is dead on, for reasons we already get – and those same reasons also support what I’m trying to point out, here.  Fox News has always been at war with the truth, and we’ve always been at war with Eastasia. Victor: “So, yeah, he’s black – but remember that’s a not-very-accurate label for who he is, necessitated by immediate circumstance.” I think your assessment is pretty accurate, actually. The crazy thing isn’t what’s happening on Foxnews. The crazy thing is that they are people who defend Foxnews. Fighting for a huge company who don’t care about you… It’s like these people defending McDonald against Morgan Spurlock! Isn’t that a little bit retarded? Anything better to do with your life? If you want to fight for a cause, there are tons of them, just pick something.  For the rest, I don’t like Foxnews so I don’t watch it. Re: Dave Bell @#150: Wow, a Tank Vixens reference. Who woulda thunk? in the immortal words of Gypsy the Robot: “Yikes…just yikes.” Who thinks that’s okay? I mean, seriously? And you know there’d be a mass uproar if CNN referred to Cindy McCain as John’s “hoe,” which is basically what Fox news has done to Michelle Obama. David Harmon @ 146,
“day Obama takes office to the day he leaves, no Faux employee will be allowed within 500 feet of the White House fence, much less in the press room” I don’t think you give Mr. Obama enough credit for the amount of class he has, or how intelligent he is.  He WILL let Faux News in, and will be able to give as good as he gets from them. I nominate Mr. Scalzi as his press secretary. I’ll bet Mr .Obama would let him conduct the press briefings from Ohio. In spite of the right-wing campaign smears, I think Mr. Obama will be the president of the whole country—even the red states.  So unlike our current idiot-in-chief. Fiona: “I nominate Mr. Scalzi as his press secretary. I’ll bet Mr .Obama would let him conduct the press briefings from Ohio.” Yeah, like I want a bunch of press vultures on my lawn. I love the sound of liberals wailing in the morning. Yes. It sounds like victory, it does. Although, I suspect, not for McCain. Scalzi: Yeah, like I want a bunch of press vultures on my lawn. If the press wants someone to tell them to get of his lawn, they’ll go cover McCain. Mr. Scalzi, You nailed it. This is the best commentary I’ve seen on the sorry little fiasco. I’m the father of three, soon to be four, biracial children, and this kind of race baiting is an attempt to push us towards a future where they are _still_ viewed with suspicion and pigeonholed because of race. It can be subtle, like six-year-old white girls telling us sadly that they think our beautiful daughter would be prettier if her skin was a little lighter or her hair a little less curly. Thanks for spelling it out so clearly. John @ 158, I MEANT via video conferencing. Kodi would keep the media vultures well away, I’m sure. Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein FOX NEWS. Das Offical Newstation of the Homeland! Would you like cheese with that whine? You didn’t seem to have a problem when Bob Beckel called Tennessee Republicans “racist crackers” on Fox News.  Did you write a whole column on that?  Somehow, I don’t think so.
And Beckel remains a frequent pundit on Fox.  Did you voice your objection to his remarks? Or maybe you would like to show past columns where you slammed the left wing cartoonists for portraying Michale Steele as a lawn jockey or Condi Rice as Prissy from the movie, Gone With The Wind? It seems that you are only insensed when it is Obama who is slammed.  Not when a black Republican is slandered. Your hypocracy knows no bounds. SKar “Now if we could just generate this level of outrage when seated politicians call our soldiers murderers and terrorists…” Citation please?  I seriously doubt that any politician not wearing a tin foil hat actually said that. Dear Mr. Scalzi, Where have you been all my life, or at least the past 7.5 years? Sincerely, A New Fan Shorter retire05: “You don’t complain about the things I think you should complain about, therefore you’re a hypocrite.” Well, you go with that, retire05. In the meantime, when I need your opinion about what I should write about, I’ll be sure to let you know. Don’t wait up. “Your hypocracy knows no bounds.” – retire05 #165 You’re spell-checker, on the other hand, does…. John in Chicago: Criticizing people’s spell-checking is fraught with danger and irony. I would like to think that Obama would have a bit more class once he’s in the Oval Office and will grant an occasional interview with FOX News. Nothing numbs the opposition further than being nice to them. Part of me wants them to bring out all the hateful racist stuff they can muster, turn the sky black with it, then LOSE. ThunderMonkey: Reminds me of the saying, “Forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them more.” John, retire05 has a good point. If you really are upset about the racial aspects of this, you should be able to point to some past posted outrage at the blatantly racist treatment of Steele or Rice by liberals. Just say’in. That still frame is bullshit. If that was for real, post a link  to an actual video of it. ANY 10 year old could photoshop some crap like that. Hell, why stop there… Why not claim that fox called the Obamas “niggers” and back it up with another photoshopped still frame from a broadcast that didn’t happen? Bottom line… Barack Obama is not a bad man, but he is NOT qualified to run a small business much less this country. Michelle Obama is the typical angry black woman. Read her college thesis. I read 25 pages of her racist rant against white people. She’s never been proud of America? How about during the civil rights movement? Black people all over the country are going to vote for him JUST BECAUSE HE’S BLACK!!!  No one even knows what this guy stands for. Just that he’s \black and that he’s a democrat… but I guess that’s all some of you need to know. Nevermind the fact that he has no experience and IS NOT QUALIFIED. But who cares… he’s black… let’s go vote for him. It’s like when I was a kid… some black kid would start shit with me, so I would proceed to kick his ass… THEN EVERY OTHER BLACK GUY IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA WOULD JUMP IN THE FIGHT EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON. That is the perfect analogy to this presidential race. As for Fox News… Liberals only hate fox news because they tell both sides of the stories instead of YOUR side. How dare they tell people both sides of the story. Bullshit: “That still frame is bullshit. If that was for real, post a link to an actual video of it.” Here you go. Don’t you feel like the dumbass now. Now, please, remove your ignorant, sexist, racist jackassed self from my site. That still frame is bullshit. If that was for real, post a link to an actual video of it. ANY 10 year old could photoshop some crap like that.  Um, dude, Fox News apologized for it.  They wouldn’t have apologized for something they didn’t do, given how seldom they apologize anyway. As for the rest of your rant, I leave your racism to Mr. Scalzi to address, since this is his space. Love the commentary, John– I’ll definitely be coming back to read more of your stuff.  Some of the comments here are truly disturbing, though….How come if you object to a news station calling the potential first lady a “baby mama,” you’re automatically a tax-raisin’ gun bannin’ baby killin’ atheistic socialistic red and green commie liberal?  How about you’re just, I don’t know, not a complete idiot? Woops, sorry for feeding the troll, John. Haha… that is awesome. I thought for sure that was some bullshit. Now that I know it’s for real I do apologize… but it is funny as hell. As for ignorant, no I am not. I am well educated. My views may be different than yours, but “ignorance” is not a word that anyone could even use to describe me. Sexist… maybe a little. [additional sexist commentary deleted — JS] Racist? Hardly. [additional racist discussion deleted. Hey, Bullshit, what part of “take a hike” did you not understand? — JS] No worries, Cofax. But yes, in general when you see someone feculating in his own ignorance here, best just to avert your eyes and keep going. Save the responses for the people of good will and intelligence, on all sides of the discussion, who come here. [deleted because now I’m bored with this jerk — JS] Well hey, at least his name was appropriate. Gretchen: Yes. The irony was he was using it to describe something else. Since we’re now attracting sexist, racist fucktards, this might be a good time to link to the comment policy. [deleted because this guy’s a boring asshole — JS] I feel that this an opportune time to remind people that according to the Program on International Policy Attitudes, Fox News viewers had a higher rate of misperceptions about the Iraq War than consumers of other media, and in general, Bush supporters were less likely than Kerry supporters to understand their own candidate’s policies. Gee, I wonder what Fux Noise’s attitude would be if Obama was married to — I don’t know — let’s say a Chinese woman.  Would it be OK to refer to her as a Chinkie? Maybe Rupert could give us his slant on that. Thank you for this.  I’m e-mailing it to my friends.  The right will slander everything and everyone they do not understand, which is just about everything and everyone. This is the first time I’ve been on your blog.  I love your writing style. Thanks for keeping it real, dog.  ;-) Peace,
Brian Brian # 189 If you like his blog, read his books. Go pick up a copy of “Old Man’s War” you won’t be disappointed! “In the meantime, when I need your opinion about what I should write about, I’ll be sure to let you know.” Whatever, and not covering all aspects of a subject makes you no more than the polical hack you are. But then, being objective doesn’t seem to be part of your m.o., does it? Yes, it is your blog, and you are free under our Constitution to write whatever tripe you chose.  And readers are free to believe that you are what you are; non-objective, biased and not worth the time. Two Things: 1) John, that was brilliant so brilliant that I would be willing to be your baby mama if it weren’t for that damned “Y” chromosome I’ve got. 2) Why is it that no one has called Michelle Malkin and Ann Coulter on what they really are: eye-candy for conservatives. Seriously, the only reason why either one of them has any following is because there are a lot of Republicans out there married to women who make Phyllis Schlafly look like Angelina Jolie. These guys aren’t interested in what Malkin and Coulter have to say, they’re just interested in fucking them. Seriously, if Michelle Malkin came over to their houses they wouldn’t want to discuss immigration policy with her, they’d just want her to put on a bar girl outfit and say “Me so horny G.I. Three holes, 20 dolla, happy ending! Bang! Bang!”. Really, is there anything else that explains why Ann Coulter, little miss conservative dresses like a high end call-girl on all of her book covers?    And this one from Coulter’s website, because you know that this is how conservative Republican women really dress.  retire05: “But then, being objective doesn’t seem to be part of your m.o., does it?” Nope. Never was. You’ll want to read that link, by the way, so you know why I’m wholly unconcerned by your criticism. As a taster, and to quote myself: But I doubt that many of the people who want me to be “fair” are actually asking for actual fairness, anyway. What they want is some sort of murmured polite dissent to whatever beef-witted thing they want to promulgate, something that implicitly suggests that their ideas have legitimacy and should be discussed reasonably among reasonable people. To which my response is: Well, no. Your opinion that whatever it is you want to foist on the world is reasonable does not mean that I have to agree, or treat it with the “fairness” you think it deserves. Rest assured that I am “fair” to the extent that I give every idea I encounter the respect I think it rates. Hope that helps, retire05. And if you don’t like it, you know where the door is. For those that think “Fair and Balanced” is remotely accurate please take a look at “Manufacturing Consent”. If however that takes too much energy, watch instead “Wag the Dog”. And pay particular attention to the fate of Dustin Hoffman’s character. John, I guess I never really thought about all the benefits a person could get by being a minority attack dog like Malkin. It’s just…it’s hard for me to wrap my mind around for some reason. Maybe it’s because where I grew up, if a minority kid starting talking like Malkin does, the other minority kids would’ve kicked her ass. I do think it is telling that the recent fucktard who posted here didn’t let his admitted ignorance of facts affect his racist, sexist, fucktardist views. We aren’t really dealing in logic here with some of these Fox fans. Jay53:
If you really are upset about the racial aspects of this, you should be able to point to some past posted outrage at the blatantly racist treatment of Steele or Rice by liberals. No, Jay, that’s *not* a good point. The proper point of comparison for Fox News would be other major news networks – like ABC, CNN, MSNBC, etc. Find an equally racist comment regarding Steele or Rice on one of those networks. You can’t? Maybe that would be because there isn’t any. And that’s one of the reasons why Fox is targetted here. Not only is the racism here blatant and revolting, it’s also unique in terms of the size of Fox’s audience and the scope of its national broadcast license/charter. . John the upside to having reporters in you front yard; you would save a bundle on fertilizer. I say Shame on Fox News! They are a disgrace to good journalism. Maybe it’s because where I grew up, if a minority kid starting talking like Malkin does, the other minority kids would’ve kicked her ass. In your analogy, the minority kid is surrounded by a protective ring of really big, well-armed white kids. In return for shouting at the other minority kids, she is being allowed to tag along with them. Mythago: Aha. That is a very descriptive analogy, and I think it clears some stuff up for me. Thanks. Bravo Mr. Scalzi, bravo. That part where you dealt so harshly with that bullshit fellow?  You know, the ignorant, sexist, racist fucktard? That was cool. I shall have to buy Zoe’s Tale in hardback, it seems. Bravo, sir, bravo. Sickening. I heard about this secondhand, and hoped I was misunderstanding. I guess I wasn’t. How the hell can that woman get away with that? How can FOX get away with that? They zapped the “terrorist fist bump” woman but they don’t chastise Malkin for this outrageous, racist, sexist remark? It would be a better world if FOX News was swallowed up a la Poltergeist and none of us ever had to hear or see their pathetic “reporting” again. I applaud you for your words, Mr. Scalzi! The enormity of ignorance displayed by Fox News, and not for the first time, is mind-boggling. They need to be called on it, and on a much higher level. I DO think that Mr. Obama, or perhaps Mrs. Obama, should look straight into the camera and ask Fox to defend their use of such volatile….um…crap! Perhaps, as one poster suggested, it should be prefaced by introducing her as the ‘baby mama’ to kickstart the actual trashing of Fox’s much-less-than-professional journalism. Sure, it was supposedly a term used by ‘outraged liberals,’ in that screenshot, and as such is somehow easier to disown by Fox. But they know their viewership, and even if they weren’t their words, they (as a ‘professional news organization), could have, and should have quoted some other pissed off liberal who ALSO wants people to get off Michelle Obama’s back, in not so incendiary words. Having said that, I just don’t understand people at all. You wrote a whole section of your post expaining why he’s black. Although he could be biracial. And all that. I never understood (and thus may be completely naive, but I hope not), why people are judged/viewed/denigrated based on the amount of melanin in their skin. (Uh oh — cliche coming, but heartfelt) Black, brown, white, red, yellow etc. Are we all not people? I will vote for Barack Obama in November because I feel he is the best candidate for the job, and have felt that way once all had thrown their hats into the ring. There’s just something about him that makes me think he could be the best President we’ve had in many years. And don’t we deserve that?? Oh!! To add to that. I think it is a GOOD thing that he hasn’t been a career high-level politician! He’s not as beholden to special interests that have consistently contributed. He’s not as beholden to other Senators that might have traded this or that vote on the floor for a vote yet to be taken, or an on-going tit-for-tat while one’s conviction slowly crumbles and one begins to acquiesce to the way the ‘system’ really works, and just becomes like the rest. Jaded and cynical? Who, me? I thought you might want to link to this site which was started by “what about our daughters” It’s so clearly needed right now.
http://michelleobamawatch.com brilliant.  absolutely brilliant. How the hell can that woman get away with that? One of the few downsides of the rule of law is that it’s considered a no-no to tar, feather, horsewhip and run certain people out of town on a rail, no matter how much they deserve it. Well, John, you’ve just gone from being my favorite new (relatively) science fiction writer to being one of my favorite people. Period. I liked it better when Malkin was organizing a boycott against the financial interest of the right-wing Carlyle Group over Rachel Ray’s wardrobe in a Dunkin Donuts commercial. I actually am at day 14 of the boycott. Thanks MM! Watch BigoTV.. @JGabriel # 136 fact check Yogi may or may not be smiling, but it isn’t in Heaven. He’s still alive. Tell it like it is! Fox sucks! Josh @145 I think my favorite part of the story was the end of the video where the anchor says (paraphrasing) “We can’t tell you the address of the field where the hateful, racist sign is, but we will tell you the intersection it is at. Since the guy who made it isn’t going to take it down, you know what to do. *wink*” You’re all Barking Moonbats. My “respect” for Mr. Scalzi has decreased dramatically over this rant. I’ll take the opinions of Michelle Malkin over any of your opinions. And I need to care what you think about me why? It always amuses me that people seem to think I’m going to look at a comment like this and go “oh noes! I am not universally loved!” and, like, fall into a heap or something. Apparently lots of people don’t realize that “kiss my ass” is one of my favorite expressions. If you want to value Malkin’s opinions over mine, fine by me. You have my pity, but hey, your life, man. Loser. That’s it. I’m getting a T-Shirt that says “Moonbat”. I’m tired of this Neo-Con bigotry, so I’m taking the word BACK people! Moonbats UNITE! (If, of course, by Moonbat, you mean “Person who thinks differently than me since I get all my info from Rush Limbaugh and other Right-Wing Talking Point Pez Dispensers. Liberal hate! Traitors!”) You can’t have the word back. We refuse to give it back. Ceroth: You’re still not getting the whole “who cares what you think?” concept, are you. Shall I use hand puppets to explain it? well said. Hand puppets?!  Now that is a video I’d like to see… :-).  Can you use the plastic dinos from the Creation Museum film? kw: Only if, during some point in the presentation, he uses the phrase “Mine is an evil laugh!” Nicely done, as always. For the record, I would love for Bill O’Reilly to refer to him as “my nigga.” Not only would it end O’Reilly’s unwarrantedly long run on Fox News, but it would potentially hand Obama millions of votes as he inevitably would laugh it off for a few moments before calmly and pleasantly delivering a verbal dismantling of O’Reilly the likes of which we haven’t seen since Lloyd Bentsen’s “You’re No Jack Kennedy.” And I don’t think even Bill O himself would dare cut off the mic of a presidential candidate. Wait, who am I kidding?  Of course he would.  It would be his last performance–he wouldn’t go out with a bang, but with the bump sound of a mic going off live. Yep. It’s part of this election and would have been regardless but it was a pity to first see it come from Democrats. I expect it from Fux and the GOP. Wile E Quixote@192: Your disgusting racist, sexist fantasies say a lot more about you than they do about conservative fans of Malkin and Coulter. If you disagree with M&C, and I hope that you do, engage with their ideas or ignore them. Don’t describe them in abusive sexualized and racialized terms. Even if you think it doesn’t count because you’re just projecting what conservatives “obviously” think of them. You’re still not getting the whole “who cares what you think?” concept, are you. Shall I use hand puppets to explain it? “My spleen! My liver!” Boss Scalzi around, get eaten by Elder Gods. It’s just not worth it. Trackback: Odds and Sods (June 14) – Baltar is my prophet edition Oops, screwed that up. Ya know, if Blogger would do this automatically, I wouldn’t have to do this the OLD FASHIONED WAY! Once more, with feeling: Odds and Sods – (June 14)- Baltar is my prophet edition PS:  GREAT POST. Epitomization of Asininity: Fox “News” When will the dillweeds wise up and unplug from this crap? Excellent post John. As a Filipino, I would like to echo Natalie Maines and say that I am deeply ashamed that Ms. Malkin is Filipino. In the late 1990s I used to watch Fox Noise because of its novelty factor and because it was great way to watch a breaking news story live. But then its tabloid approach plus its incessant Clinton bashing turned me off them for good and blatant neocon propaganda turned me off them permanently. I think this brouhaha was some sort of comeback by someone at Fox Noise for what he/she thinks of as the martyrdom of E.D. Hill’s show by the forces of the ‘Liberal Mass Media’. WORD! I really see no issue with this at all.  Its part of the lingo.  Seems to me everyone is being thin-skinned about this.  Its just politics.  Obama and Michelle are not off limits to this.  Both of them need to butch up and understand that its going to get much worse over the coming 5 months.  This wide-eyed, psuedo-innocent, selective outrage of Obama and his witless supporters is already silly.  And I’m sure there is more silliness to come. Yup. Here we go…. Criticize an Obama… and you are a dirty racist!! At least FOX is speaking a language you sheep can understand. Getting the racial angle out of this, I also have to wonder if Malkin would lose her shit — as only Malkin can — if she was constantly referred to as ‘baby’ or ‘girl’.  Where I come from, conservatives don’t talk to, or about, grown women like they’re children.  Not if they want to keep all their teeth. It’s really sad that republicans actually agree with this crap on Fox News. It’s quite sad really. Wow, it did take kind of a lot of comments for the racists to come slithering in, didn’t it? Well, I did trim out some comments before, mythago. And as far as the ones at 233 and 234 are concerned, you can actually see their lips move as they read off their “you liberals are so easily offended” note cards, so it’s hard to take them very seriously. MarkHB@2: Thatcher was black?!?!? Actually, if rainbow trout know something about knitting it would explain a lot about trout flies … they sure go for some funny looking doodads. As for “Baby Mama” … sheesh! Hmm.  All I can say is that from the posts I have read, everyone seems to be struck retarded.  As stupid as it was for Fox News to use that phrase (less likely as a racial epitaph than an attempt to be socially relevant) it is also moronic for the left to attack this as racist (since it is a term that is widely used by people both white and black).  The facts of the matter are, that Obama’s presidency (for I believe that [barring some scandal] he will be the next president) is going to be defined by race even though his supposed goal was not to be so.  Anyone who disagrees with his policies will be tagged as a racist, while anyone who jumps on board without heavy backup for their position will be tagged as a racial panderer.  No issue will be truely addressed, but then again I suppose that we will have to have at least one racially motivated election/presidency before any legitimate candidate can be effective, and that is for either side. MarkHB@2: Thatcher was black?!?!? Ho ho ho, sharks.  But some of us whose memories last longer than 3.2 seconds remember when the conventional wisdom that “Britian isn’t ready” for a female leader of the opposition, let alone becoming Prime Minister.  Especially one whose gender and background was hardly that of the stereotypically upper class, Eton-Oxford educated Tory toff. Yo! Fox news just being down with it! Keepin’ it real! Showin’ off deys street cred wit da hip hop lingo. Afta all, Obama did da same with the rightous Rev Wright for tweny years bro! Sheeeeet! Fox News must be like da the furst white boys to say “baby mama” after like a millon bruthers n sisters. Dem crazy blue eyed devils…dey always rippin’ off hip hop stylin’. Nex thang u know, Fox News be callin’ Obama’s baby mama’s weddin’ ring, bling!
Fight da power! Where be ma 40 acres an mule? Aaron@240: Not only have you completely missed the reason why this was a racist insult, you seem to have some odd ideas about what makes a phrase racist.  I’ll give you an example of how silly your arguments sound, using the word ‘boy’: it is “widely used by people both white and black,” and “Obama’s presidency … is going to be defined by race,” so if a major television news outlet referred to Mr. Obama as “that boy,” it would be moronic to attack that as racist.  Never mind that, as a grown man, Mr. Obama is obviously not a ‘boy’ in the usual sense of “very young male,” and there is a well-known usage of the word by racists to belittle black men. Along the same lines, “X’s baby mama” is typically used to describe a woman who has had a child by X without marrying him.  This meaning plainly doesn’t fit Mrs. Obama, so why use it?  Mr. Scalzi explained this quite clearly, and I’m not sure how you missed it. Ah, wait, I see it now.  I’ve noticed your use of “his supposed goal,” and “[a]nyone who disagrees with his policies will be tagged as a racist, while anyone who jumps on board without heavy backup for their position will be tagged as a racial panderer.”  Perhaps you are one of those people who are so tired of all this racism, so weary of the inevitable use of the ‘race card,’ that you simply cannot stomach any talk of race, even when it is to decry legitimate instances of racist nonsense.  If that is the case, save the wear and tear on your keyboard and go have a nice lie down. LOL!  I’m not sure if someone has commented on this already, but Obama would tell folks in southern Illinois that his named rhymed with “yo mama” (recent WaPo article). Obviously, he was trying to say he was black as Satan to anger Scalzi. What a load of rubbish.  Why don’t you just admit you have a crush on Obama and make a YouTube video with you running around in high-heels and underwear? JB, yet another subscriber to the “Obama once said this one thing about himself, so it’s perfectly okay for Fox News to say this completely other, racist thing about his wife” line of thinking. Did a site filled with especially unthinking conservatives just link in? They do seem to be a bit thicker on the ground here in the last day. Get over your obsession with race. Fox News first. John, I’m not a conservative, but is it racist for Obama to say that or for his wife to describe him as her baby’s daddy? Maybe I’m missing something, but the Obamas seem to want to embrace African-American culture when it suits them (think Trinity) and then distance themselves from it when it doesn’t (think Trinity again). If Fox was running this continuously for weeks, it would be a bit ridiculous, but for a day?  It’s mirthful and does riff on the rhyme with ‘mama’ and ‘Obama’.  People will never be comfortable in their own skin (whatever pigment it is) if they can’t learn to laugh at the little things.  That’s one area where the gay community has excelled.  Instead of getting offended by every stereotype and comment, they embrace them and turn them into comedy. For what it’s worth, people who get easily offended, offend me.  There are plenty of real things to be upset about.  This is making a mountain out of a molehill. JB: “If Fox was running this continuously for weeks, it would be a bit ridiculous, but for a day?” Well, and there was the thing right before that, with the “terrorist fist jab.” And the thing before that, where the Fox  News commentator openly hoped for Obama to get assassinated. And then there’s the whole “Barack Hussein Obama” mantra. So, yeah, actually, Fox has been doing this sort of crap for weeks, JB. And sure, they apologize for it all after it happens, but by then the dog whistle has been blown and all right ears have been perked up. It’s possible, of course, that a news organization with an open and obvious bias toward the GOP just keeps doing these sort of things unintentionally — that their folks are so completely clueless that it doesn’t occur to them what fuck-ups they are until after the fact. But after a certain point it begins to be reasonable to wonder how many clueless fuck-ups Fox News should get to have before you can point to a legitimate campaign to discredit a Democratic candidate through innuendo, fear-mongering and racism. But if you want to think it’s just a one-time thing, JB, you go right ahead. There are a lot of people who seem to think all of these things are just a “one time” sort of thing, if only because Fox News and its fellow travelers are generally smart enough to avoid going for the same smear twice, and because a lot of people either don’t want to connect the dots, or aren’t capable of doing so. John great post. I think the right wing wackos are linking through Kos. The trolls from there will filter down to a few less well known blogs to try the rush/malkin talking points to a new audience. LOL pitiful Maybe I’m missing something No, I don’t think you’re missing anything; you’re just choosing to portray yourself as Mr. Easygoing, which requires you to brush aside Fox News’s use of a racist insult to, essentially, call Michelle Obama a whore.  If you’d find it “mirthful” to hear somebody call your wife names on public television, I guess that’d be your problem. Me, I’m offended at people who think it’s their business to go around telling others to STFU and grab their ankles whenever a bigot’s lips start flapping. Do try to learn the difference between laughing at oneself, and laughing at insults directed at oneself by others. I’m not even going to get into the irony of your paying homage to the mythically un-offendable gay community after your suggestion that John go around in high heels and underwear on a YouTube video. Mixed feelings much? See, I can’t see the point in being outraged. Or upset or anything. This is AMERICAN politics, the childrens playland of politics, its how it is. Politically, this country sucks as much as it is possible to suck. Its downright SHAMEFUL. Yes, FoxNews said something they should not have  said and blah blah blah. But they’re just acting as a voice for one part of the American people and behaving the way most American people do. No use being upset at them, if they say something bad, heres an asinine idea, ignore them. Jesus Christ, people. Grow the fuck up. Don’t you have better things to do, like raise kids, expand your mind and own horizons? (I’m not aiming at the people at this site or anything, but people who make way too big a deal about things in general.) BTW, I don’t pay attention to FoxNews or any other news organization because they fail to actually report any news. I have no bias against any particular one, just all of them. :P Did anyone else find it funny (in a how can they be so stupid way) that the clip that John linked to in #176 has Michelle Malkin saying that criticism of Michelle Obama is OK as long as it is relevant and not just an insult (which is something I agree with BTW) seconds after the offensive message appeared on screen. John, as I’m sure you are aware, you really nailed it this time. First of all: PROUD to be a Barking Moonbat… Want the T-Shirt… Second: John, your commentary on how Obama’s racial makeup will be seen by anyone who cares in EITHER direction was the most insightful part of the piece. What you said was not an opinion but a logical conclusion based on actual observation of the racial issues that exist in the real world. So add a bravo from me… Third: (From upstream) Of course President Obama will allow Fux News into the briefing room. In fact, he would be smart to give them a reserved seat in the front row, and call on them every time they raise a hand… After all, they will provide PERFECT opportunities for the Press Secretary to make whatever points they are trying for that day, since the Fux questions will provide excellent jump-off points for logical rebuttals to any inane neo-Con-fucktard  objections. With Fux playing straight man, the Administration won’t be able to lose… PS: John, will you please reconsider your rejection of the position of Press Secretary? Since Jon Stewart is going to be VP, that means it’s either you or we have to recruit the ghost of Tim Russert (RIP Timmy!!!)… John, “Dog whistle”?  Are you the one now calling people animals? So all those are part of some grand conspiracy to tell people what exactly?  Obama is black, Hussein is his middle name, and that his supporters like to cry a lot?.  I have news for you…things are going to get a lot rougher.  If that is too tough for Obama, then he should not be running for president. mythago, Have you ever heard of Obama girl?  Are you really that ignorant to not get that reference? So Michelle was calling Barak a “whore” (your word) when she referred to him as her “baby’s daddy”? Please go buy a clue or steal one from somebody who has one. Ummm… JB? Look up the meanings of both… they are not the same… Baby Mama is much more derogatory and “whore” is one of the connotations… Mythago has a huge clue… let me snip off one tiny corner of it for you… Skipping all of the comments to simply say:  I love you. Why, thank you, Reba! John’s pretty cool too… What a load of rubbish. Why don’t you just admit you have a crush on Obama and make a YouTube video with you running around in high-heels and underwear? And more:
Have you ever heard of Obama girl? Are you really that ignorant to not get that reference? I got the reference, JB, but it’s funny that when you wanted to insult Scalzi that’s where your mind went.  (Personally, I wouldn’t mind seeing Mr Scalzi in hooker drag twirling around a pole, but I’m just perverted that way.)  John’s not a real man now — he’s some silly little fluff-head with a man-crush? Where I come from, we have a saying — when you’re in a hole, the first thing to do is stop digging. But I am going to disagree with our host on one thing:
It’s possible, of course, that a news organization with an open and obvious bias toward the GOP… Really, and when did Senator Clinton flip parties? The likes of Coulter, O’Reilly and Sean Innanity don’t seem to be terribly keen on the presumptive GOP nominee. :) Craig, My mind went to the empty-headed girl who puts her Obama crush video on YouTube where she prances around not wearing much while telling us all that she thinks Obama is great.  I’m insulting Scalzi because of his knee-jerk defense of Obama and getting so holier-than-thou offended  at minor things.  Scalzi like Obama girl and countless others seem to project their fantasies on Obama like he is the second-coming.  It would be amusing if it wasn’t so sad. JB: Yes, I’ve been nothing but a slavering Obama fanboy from day one. JB, we’ve established that you think that the snarky racism of a major news organization is kicky innocent fun, and we’ve also established you haven’t the first clue about anything about me, and between the two of these, I think we’ve also established you’re a bit of an asshole. I think you’ve accomplished all you came for in this thread, don’t you? Time to wrap things up, which is to say, you’re done here now. Move along. To ensure you do move along, you’re in the moderation queue, so anything you try to post will have to go through me first. If you try to post in this thread again, you’ll just be wasting your time. Wow–I was linked to this via a bb. Great pithy and scathing rant about poor excuse for information that is Fox News. I confess I am confounded by Ms Malkin–how does she sleep at night? As for Obama, I was a Hillary supporter and have some regrets that the nom is not her. But Obama is a more than adequate candidate (their positions were fairly similar). I am proud to have the junior senator from my state be the nominee and will be voting for him in November. I am thinking of starting a pool–what stereotype will Fox pull an “oops!” about next? Will Obama be found to fear cats? Will he be seen in footage eating watermelon? Will Michelle start to wear bling? I’m breathless with anticipation! Is it this blog or do the conservatives who have posted here just not make much sense? The dearth of critical thinking skills is a bit dismaying…. Y’know, I really, really, really resent the appendage of the noun “News” after the network name “Fox.”  It is as demeaning to news as Fox is to blacks. And, JB, like John I’m hardly one of those “Obama cultists” you hear so much about — but FFS…  I’m slightly to the right of Orson Scott Card and Larry Niven, and Fox is just turned into some embarrasing vision of what would happen if Judd Apatow was put in charge of a cable news network.  Then again, I’m being unfair to Mr. Apatow — he doesn’t pretend his salacious frat-boy drivel is hard news. But, being a glass half-full kind of guy, at least we’ve been spared the degraded and degrading spectacle of Clinton facing off against Mitt Romney or Mike Huckabee. Eleanor: “Is it this blog or do the conservatives who have posted here just not make much sense?” This blog has a number of conservative commentators who make excellent and challenging comments when I post about politics, actually, and I’m happy about that. This thread has a bit more noise than most comment threads because it’s been so widely linked. and getting so holier-than-thou offended at minor things That is the LAST time I am bringing my irony detector onto the Internet. Damn thing keeps overloading. JB, if you can hear us down there in the moderation queue: See, this is a written medium. It’s a little hard to pretend you misheard, or deliberately misspeak and hope nobody caught it. So when you pretend that you thought the Fox News headline was “baby’s mama” rather than “baby mama”, you get your pick of whether you’re confessing to be sloppy or a bad liar. Or both, if you’re feeling robust. re Fox News, I guess I’m disappointed that the dogwhistle is so, well, amateurish. Lee Atwater must be rolling in his grave. I like the term ‘Fox pas’
adj – describing an action or statement stupid enough to be worthy of Fox News, as in “Wow, what a Fox pas the ‘baby mama’ comment was!” Eleanor @ 263: I am thinking of starting a pool–what stereotype will Fox pull an “oops!” about next? Will Obama be found to fear cats? Will he be seen in footage eating watermelon? Will Michelle start to wear bling? I’m breathless with anticipation! Well, the 4th of July is right around the corner, so there is a good chance they might catch him eating fried chicken AND watermelon on the same day! Oh, but wait, I forgot — he hates America (as evidenced by the lack of a flag pin on his lapel) so he probably won’t be celebrating her birthday. </snark> As for FAUX News and the idiots who try to defend them, I would simply point out the sage comment of Ron White: “You can’t fix stupid!” BTW, John — great post! What does Fox News really stand for? Fascist, Outragous, Xenophoia news. They were the cheerleaders of the war on Iraq and attacked anyone who disagreed with the administration. The comments on “baby mama” falls under the outragous area. This is a way of changing the topic by being outragous and diverting the public’s attention away from real issues. While F.O.X. says I’m sorry it won’t happen again until the next time, and so it goes on and on and on. The issue with FOX is a global problem that modern democracy still hasn’t cracked: what to do when a major “4th estate”, unaccountable news organization decides to pull out all the stops in pursuing a political agenda. It’s the same in Italy (dominated for almost 15 years by a media magnate), in UK (where Murdoch and the tabloids pretty much set the agenda) and to a certain extent even in Spain and France. You can’t match Fox and its ilk on a outrage-by-outrage basis: that’s exactly what they want. In pointing out the “scandal”, you are publicizing their views even better than they could on their own. By reporting or criticizing their message, you are amplifying their dog-whistling. By pointing out their racism, you’re bringing back racism as the topic of this campaign, which it really shouldn’t be at this time in history (unless you enjoy living in a country that in less than a decade has lost any international credibility whatsoever and is quickly losing all its economic power as well, bringing its long-time allies down with it). At the same time you can’t really ignore them, because they’ll go on building their popularity unchallenged, brainwashing the “faithful” like poor Charles above. If you try imposing fairness through legislation, they will scream censorship (and I agree it’s a slippery slope). If you build independent state-run media, they will be “occupied” after the first electoral victory.
In a way, these “news” outlets are the worst type of internet trolls: they took over the board (more than 20 years ago), there is no moderator, and you can’t move to a new forum. Up to now, Obama has been good in keeping these factors out of the race, but his audience was naturally limited. Now he has to deal with the full power of the meme-machines, and I’m curious about how he’ll choose to respond, mainly because I wouldn’t know how to respond either. Up to now his tactic seems to be to let media storms settle on their own, while addressing the points of merit a bit later; it seems to work, albeit not perfectly (especially when even “friends” are determined to exploit their 15 minutes of exposure).
In a way, he tries to  starve the noise-machine; you, John, are feeding it. A clarification I can’t help offering (though I know I’ve missed my moment), especially re 111, 140: Black and biracial are not mutually exclusive categories. The same person can quite easily identify as both. While there *are* many people identifying as “biracial but not black” and refusing to be identified as black or to check the “African-American” box on census forms, etc, this approach is not the only way to embrace a biracial identity. And of course, the use of biracial to mean only black/white is sloppy and inaccurate, if clear enough in this context. Many commenters seemed confused on this point (John Scalzi, I suspect you aren’t, but the post did set it up as an either/or question). Dance: Indeed, I do think people do see it as either/or. Fox News was wrong to use that sort of language, which I take was the producers decision, and not some vast right wing conspiracy there. Michelle Malkin, didn’t have anything to do with what was displayed on the screen, so taking this out on her is sort of misplaced.  She constantly gets hate mail calling her far worse than “baby mama.” Now, personally, like just about every commentator out there, sometimes MM and AC are on and get it right. Sometimes they are way in right field and their rhetoric is a hindrance to the point they are making. And it’s interesting that many of the same people who are decrying this particular kerfluffle, don’t have any problem spouting bigoted rhetoric about conservatives, republicans, or Christians. Giacomo @ 272: “If you try imposing fairness through legislation,” And how do you define fairness when most issues have more than 2 sides to it.  Something that to many people seem to forget. I have to wonder what everyone thinks of the Mark Steyn trial up in Canada.  How many people are in favor of anti-hate speech laws? Yawn. People who comment just write something like “yawn”: Yawn. Keith Indy @ 275: Anti-hate speech laws? I live in Sweden (don’t klick my name unless you speak Swedish) and we have them. It’s forbidden to say bad things about Jews, homosexuals and a few other groups. I think the whole group idea is stupid. Why would it be more illegal to claim that all homosexuals will burn in hell, than to claim that all heterosexuals will burn in hell? I’d much prefer a system where the basis for whether a comment is illegal or not is if it harmed the targeted individual. Wait — we’re afraid of CATS now??? (I swear, this year I have learned more anti-black stereotypes than I ever heard of in nearly 35 years of actually being black.  Also new to me: we can’t swim and are addicted to grape soda??!  But… why is this black?  Grape soda is mediocre after age eight, and swimming is good times.) At first I thought the cat thing was supposed to be a Hitler joke. :-/ Say, Mac… If you’re not going to finish that Nehi, would you toss it across the pool to me? Keith @275: note that I said that, at this point, is basically impossible to legislate… but if one had to try, he should consider this: “fair” is not “equidistant” nor “balanced”. Fairness should be as close to truth as possible, which is difficult to do, but not impossible. Note that the US indeed used to have legislation pushing in that direction, and it was abolished by “progressive” representatives, which in the long run resulted in a worse standard of reporting. The way to hell is paved by good intentions… @edward, #280 –  I would be pleased as punch to share my Nehi with your bad moonbat self. ;-)   (I will be over here in my floaty chair, sipping my icy-cool homemade sorrel drink.  Try it!) i say carry on! THANK YOU, THANK YOU & THANK YOU!!!!  For giving me a laugh from this sad BS commentary that we all must sit through day after day.  I know its been gettin’ on my last nerve too.  And you summed it up nicely when you said it was all an attempt to remind folks that he’s black.  They are screaming loud and clear = Stop!!  Stop reacting to him as an intelligent and educated man!  Stop!!  Stop reacting to him as a family man that loves his wife and cares for his children!!  Stop!!  Stop reacting to him as a man that has proven his passion for serving the community and ALL people!!  No, no, no!!  Remember that he’s a BLACK man so that trumps all that “treat and respect him like the human being he is” crap!!  Sheeesh!! My two cents, The Sauda Voice
http://www.thesaudavoice.com He, and she, are exactly as they portray them. Osama hates whites, America, freedom, prosperity, and free will. He is a communist, along with Nancy Pepsi cola, and all the other great thinkers on their so called dream team. Do you like being told what to do, how to heat, and cool your home, what to drive, what light bulbs to use, even if they are unsafe, what, if any health care you will get, and how much YOU will pay for it, oh, and Osama say’s we are to stupid to do our own tax’s, so he will send us a pre paid tax, or, um, prepared return? Is this what you want, or would you rather make some decisions on your own, like the adults you are supposed to be. I don’t like anyone telling me what to do, or how to live my life, most people don’t, just the weak like it, it makes them feel safe, and cuddly. Gee, John, are you trolling your own boards now, calling yourself “Warrior” and showing just how ridiculous actual right-wing arguments are? Don’t you get enough posters? Mac: When I was in the Navy, we had plenty of black men with us in basic training. On Swim Day, the first thing most (not all) said was “Brothers don’t swim!” I’d never heard such a thing before. Sure enough – I don’t remember many of them swimming well, or really much at all. (Full disclosure, I don’t swim so well either – but I was not part of a group who stereotyped themselves as not swimming and then proved it.) Ever since then, whenever I see black men involved in some activity where they are immersed in water somehow, I immediately flash back to that “Brothers don’t swim.” moment, and to my great chagrin, I rarely see many that do. I don’t know if I’m just noticing it because of my past experience, or if indeed many black men prefer not to swim. Keep in mind I’ve never thought black men “couldn’t” swim, just that they seem to prefer not to, generally speaking. (Swimming is not the same as cooling off in the pool. I’m not sure if I’ve ever met anyone who does not enjoy that.) @287—Enlisted basic training?  Swimming is a class marker, and it perpetuates, because parents teach children how to swim. The reviews for this book suggest that municipal pools in some neighborhoods were closed rather than integrate. There are a number of socio-economic factors that add up to “brothers don’t swim!” I think the fact that my dad was born and grew up two seconds from a beach in the West Indies is probably a factor. :-)  Not swimming was never even entertained as an option. I was tossed in at age three. (This is why I like to draw distinctions between “black”  and “African American,” “Caribbean,” and all those other diaspora subgroups, sometimes.  As well as “African From Africa,” as it’s coming to be called, ha ha.  In terms of culture at least.) Hmmm — another factor being just how landlocked a person is.  I suppose the odds are pretty high, considering our geography, that these guys weren’t on a coast and HAD to rely on a public pool. (But I still love my kitty and grape soda is yucky. Give me tea, Earl Grey, hot. ;-D) Corby Kennard, You attack me for my view, and say I’m a ridiculous right-wing nut. What in the hell does your racist comment about blacks can’t swim have to do with this topic. You are like all the other Lib’s. Shoot off your mouth for 10 minutes, and say nothing. You, a Dem, Lib of all people, should not be talking racist. You are the first people to bring up race, and attack anyone else that speaks about Osama’s color. I didn’t say anything about his color, and could care less if he were purple. HE’S STILL A RED COMMUNIST, AND AN IDIOT, MORON, just like you. Warrior, calm yourself or you’ll be calmed involuntarily. Likewise, and again, everyone should try to avoid personal attacks. Don’t make me get out the stick. And from here on out the stick will be applied without warning. AAaauummm, AAaauumm, AAaauumm. Meditation is good to calm ones self. I feel better already. Yoga works also. Excellent. Thank you. Ya know I saw this almost word for word on the daily show last week. I’ll have to return with a link from hulu. I’ll admit that the headline made me cringe, but don’t miss the irony: It’s the liberals that want to treat Michelle like BHO’s “baby mama.” Because, you know, if that’s all she was, she WOULD be irrelevant  to the campaign, and not newsworthy at all. “Leave her alone! That’s not nice! She’s just his baby mama after all!” But (and this point has already been well made) as it stands, she is his wife of many years, and an active campaigner and speaker on his behalf. Warrior: Do you truly believe Obama is Communist? If so, why? Warrior, without cogent arguments to support your thesis re: Obama’s status as a communist, racist and hater of all things American, you won’t be taken seriously by any thinking person, whether that person be conservative or liberal.  Hence the perception that you are a “ridiculous right-wing nut.” Evidence to support your arguments would also be nice. Hehe. Warrior – I don’t believe I was talking to you about the swimming thing. I also don’t believe it is racist to acknowledge race. I think most “minorities” would rather you acknowledge whatever makes them a minority rather than ignore it, and appreciate those differences. As to the content of my comment – I believe I was remarking on the stereotype and how, sometimes, no matter how much one hates it, it seems to be, if not wholly true, to have the absurd ring of truth, at least in one person’s experience. This is not to say that I believe, for example, that black men (to accede to Mac, of any persuasion: Caribbean, African, etc) are unable to swim, and indeed are afraid of the water. I believe my whole point was that I have had the odd experience of seeing this specific stereotype in action. I believe we all have at one point or another experienced a stereotype come to life – and if you are any kind of human you probably think two things at once: 1) Holy crap, what a stereotype! and 2) Oh crap – a stereotype. I think those reactions are completely human. What WOULD have been racist, Warrior, was if I would have said something along the lines of “Stupid (racial epithet) can’t (some action) cause they are (some color/sexual orientation/gender)” and then laughed at them. Perhaps that is what you heard from my comment – but the person I was speaking to – again, Mac – apparently understood my point and was even informative and interesting when he did so. I’m sorry you didn’t get that. I’ve heard some people comment that they’d love to see Michelle Obama make a bid for the White House at some point. A part of me snickers at the thought of what Fox “News” and other like-minded people think of THAT idea. Another part of me cringes at the thought of a repeat of this past Democratic race- with all the horrible sexist comments thrown at Hiliary, and racist comments about Obama- only this time, all those racist/sexist comments are thrown in conjunction, at the same candidate. I’d love to see the US progress to the point where nobody thinks twice about electing a president, without race, sex, gender, orientation, religion, and all those other prejudicial issues getting in the way of the issues that matter. Politics isn’t about politics as much as it’s about the politician, and that’s disheartening. When I read the post’s portion on racial identity, I read his comments to mean that no matter what one chooses to identify oneself as, society will always see you primarily as the race your phenotype most resembles. My ancestry includes Lumbee Native American along with latino, but when people see me they see me as black and treat me as a black woman. I think that is the point. Yeah, we know Obama is biracial, but as to the way he is treated by the media and society, he is a black man.
I know that many african americans who are multiracial can understand this–how you can fully aware of your diverse heritage but still primarily identify yourself as black and grow up within the identity of a black person. Anyway, loved the rant and I passed it onto many of my friends. It was really spot on. How I loathe Fox News and their self-hating minority hand puppets. Lets find a media outlet that isn’t biased one way or another.  Oh wait, there isn’t one. Anonymous and Carol Elaine, Sorry, I’ve been busy, but to answer your question, first, anyone who wants more goverment control, in what ever sector, is on the communist side of thinking. Read Mao’s little Red book if you want to know the truth, and how they, The Dem’s, are using this propaganda. My wife grew up under Mao’s rule, and knows first hand, and told me how it was during Moa, and after Mao. Obama says more tax’s, what will you do about it. He say’s national health, and you will be paying 50% to 70% tax, what will you do about it. He say’s you can’t heat your home at 72, what will you do about it. He say’s you can’t drive your SUV’S, what will you do about it. He say’s illeagal immagrants will have free school, medical, meals, etc., and your tax’s will pay for it, what will you do about it. I could go on, and on. The only people that like him, are, just like in China, with Mao, the ones that have nothing, and don’t want to work for anything, and want the other people trying to improve, to be on the same level, and get no more than they. I don’t want anyone telling me how, or what, or when to live my life, let alone be taxed for it. As for Carol Elaine, again, I say read Mao’s little Red book, and you will be educated. It is the base for the government as it is becoming under Dem control, and the New change under the Dem, Obama, and his gang. I think, as a rational, real life, normal person, not one of your Lib thinkers, that I am adult enough to decide what is good for me, and don’t need some power hungry morons to run my life, and make me pay for them to protect me, because I am not able to. My God, the things they have said, and done in the last 6 or so months, makes me sick. You have to admit, they have some new idea almost every week, on how to control us, and everything else in America, from big business, to what light bulbs you will be able to use. You are probably not old enough to know what it was like growing up in the 60’s and 70’s, to have anything to compare today with, but I did, and see that as the rest of the world has become more free, America has become more communistic. The Dem’s, and all in government here in America, if the truth be known, really want communisum, and total control, but the trick is doing it, without the rest of the world catching on. Oh, America the free wants communisum, it can’t be, but in fact, that’s what the Dem, Lib, Obama, and Nancy, and Teddy, and Kerry, and Gore, and all the rest of your thinkers want, total CONTROL, and you are all being fed this crap propaganda, and being manipulated into their little plan. They start with, oh the poor need health care, the polar bear is going to vanish, and on, and on, and make one new law after another, until you have, COMMUNISUM!!!!! Wake up, before you are equal, and have no reason to improve your lives, and you walk around in a daze bumping into walls, because you are unable to think for yourself anymore. Sorry if shocked anyone, but I’m sure you can get some free treatment from some government shrink if you need to heal. Obama, and his gang could save alot of time, by just printing Mao’s little red book in english, and calling it My guide to change, and hope for America, and giving it to every American, and demanding they follow its rules. GOVERNMENT CONTROL = COMMUNISUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!

GOVERNMENT CONTROL = COMMUNISUM!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sorry, I hit submit befor I listed a name. Its me, I’m Baacckk.. Corby Kennard, I don’t really care what you said, and might not think you are being racist, but if you ask a black person what they think about it, well, they would say you are a white racist. I think most blacks are more racist, than whites. They can say what ever they want, but you better not say anything in reply, or you are a racist. Opra is one of the biggest racist I have seen, but she is put up on her soap box every day to tell us how to live. I work with blacks, and mexicans, and asians, and whites, and we say what we want to one another, and bash each others race in fun, and no one gets offended, but go out on the street, and you will be arrested for the same thing. All races have been wronged over time, and no one is owed anything because of it. It is past, way past, and people should get on with their lives. John Scalzi, after your comment #249, I think you should have the stick taken to you. You should be ashamed, and go stand in the corner. FREEDOM is what its all about. What made this country great, and why everyone wants to come here. Don’t try to change it, take it away, or destroy it, or all you thinkers will be in for a great shock, and wake up, and it will be to late. Warrior, anyone who was actually married to a victim of Mao’s tyranny would not be stupid enough to compare that horror to Obama. C’mon, man, Scalzi picks more convincing trolls out of his dryer lint trap. A part of me snickers at the thought of what Fox “News” and other like-minded people think of THAT idea.  Did you know that she’s had two children….with a BLACK MAN?!?! mythago, You know nothing about it, just what you have heard through propaganda. I am married to a victim, as you put it, and have been told many stories, and have been to China many times.  I am not saying Obama is as horrific, but is wanting to take us there one step at a time. They will do it in stages so that we might not catch on before it is to late. As for day in, and day out normal life while in China, I felt I had more freedom in Shanghai, than I do here. Sad, isn’t it. As I said before, read Mao’s little red book, and maybe go to China, then talk as if you know something about the subjet of communisum. We are headed that way, and being sold out for greed, and power. I can’t understand how educated people can fall for the crap being spread around. Can you not see your freedom being taken away, or in the works to be taken away? That’s all that matters, not who, or what party is doing it, just that it be stopped, before it is to late. So if some one wants to call me a “ridiculous right-wing nut.”, so be it, but I am right about the above statement no matter what side you are on. “All races have been wronged over time, and no one is owed anything because of it. It is past, way past, and people should get on with their lives.” Yes, I remember my gramps telling me about the days when whites were considered property, or the days when they couldn’t vote, routinely got hanged from trees for looking at black women the wrong way, or when blacks made them ride in the back of the bus and use separate bathrooms. “That’s all that matters, not who, or what party is doing it, just that it be stopped, before it is to late.” I don’t get it.  Are we supposed to vote Canadian? I like that the news is making this election about talking about NOT talking about the candidates’ wives.  I guess we’re either supposed to vote for the one whose wife didn’t say the dumbest thing or the one who didn’t bring it up repeatedly that the wife said dumb things. Marko – Blacks were not the first and only enslaved race, just the most recent.  And by comparison to ethnic cleansing, they didn’t have it that bad. Warrior: “John Scalzi, after your comment #249, I think you should have the stick taken to you. You should be ashamed, and go stand in the corner.” What makes you think I care what you think, Warrior? Also, please aggregate multiple responses in a single post, if you please. Too many posts in sequence from the same person annoys me. Marko, I suppose we owe you for what happened in the past. No one is alive today that had anything to do with slavery, just as no one is alive that had anything to do with the Jew’s, and the Japanese being put into camps. The Chinese slave trade, and prostitution here in America. What about the treatment of the Indian;s here in America. The Irish, the Italian’s being treated as scum when they immigrated here, and they were white. Shall I go back to when the Romans raped, killed, and enslaved WHITES back in the past. How much time must pass before people move on. No other race continues to act as if they are owed for this, and no other race continues to cry about it. Why not show that they were wrong, and make something of yourself, instead of crying poor me all the time. I would say if anyone, the Indiana’s should have been given more help, seeing as we invaded their land, an took it all from them. And John Scalzi, I think I hit a nerve with you also. And  Baffled, what I mean, is, it doesn’t matter who you vote for, just vote for the party that is Pro American, not communist, like the Dem,s are. I would vote for Bob Barr if I thought he could win, he is what we need, less government, and less tax’s, how can you argue for the side that wants government control of your lives. I am not here just to bash Dem,s. I would bash anyone for government control of my life, and trying to destroy America from the inside. Warrior: “And John Scalzi, I think I hit a nerve with you also.” Aside from annoying me with multiple serial comments, no, not really. @ 298  Hehe. Warrior – I don’t believe I was talking to you about the swimming thing. I also don’t believe it is racist to acknowledge race. I think most “minorities” would rather you acknowledge whatever makes them a minority rather than ignore it, and appreciate those differences. Yes, that! (FYI, I’ve always found “I don’t think of you as black” to be one of the more terribly hurtful things people have said to me. Like, what do you think “black” means that you don’t want to associate it with me? Why are you ignoring a major part of who I am?  Why is “black” a negative thing that must be Not Spoken Of?) I found Corby Kennard’s statement to be a simple anecdote of facts that took place, and things he was told, not a racist statement. In fact, I’m rather baffled at how they could be interpreted as such.  He reported what happened — he didn’t even draw conclusions, just analyzed his own attitudes. (I also enjoy speaking for myself, thenk yew, as opposed to being represented by generalized assumptions, or speaking for others.) Making race a taboo topic feeds into ignorance, and it makes people resentful when their legitimate questions and curiosity are silenced and they are made to feel guilty for things that should not cause guilt.  Differences exist, in physicality and in experience — noticing this isn’t evil. Treating others as inferior based on the difference is what’s evil.  In my humble opinion. ;-) I thought I’d be going back to a post way dead by now but apparently this post lives on. I was just playing on wordle.net and decided to put in your post on the Obamas (it was beautiful by the way) and it was so perfect I had to show it off. It’s like a poster Fox might show while reporting.
 Thought I just posted this but it’s possible there was a glitch. Just put your post on wordle.net and came up with this beautiful image. It cracked me up. Just in case people didn’t understand Fox will be glad to show them:  Also have you watched the Daily Show from 16 Jun 08? I think you’d like it.
http://www.thedailyshow.com/full-episodes/index.jhtml?episodeId=173519 Yo, race is a social construct, remember? What you be talking about? John Scalzion ,  Hit a nerve,  annoy, one and the same.
Dem’s don’t like it when the truth slaps them in the face.  Mac, Why are you still going on about blacks, and swimming, and race. The Dem’s are always the ones to bring up race, or sex, but try to say it is the Republicans that do it. Look, Obama is just a pawn. No one ever heard of him before, he did nothing in the senate, and wasn’t even good at that. Are you going to tell me he is the best the Dem’s have of all the people in their party, come on. He is a puppet to dance to their song. Do you really think his CHANGE, is, or can be, any different than all the others before him. If he does not follow the Dem rule, he will vanish from the party, and they will turn on him quickly.  He can’t be the best they could offer. What ever happened to the JFK’S, or the Regan’s. Wouldn’t it be exciting to have someone such as JFK running against Regan? What do we have, Obama, and McCain, geez. Is there no one better? Everyone love JFK, blacks’ whites, rich, and poor. Obama? True story. Today at work, I work in a factory by the way, We are on break, 2 white guy’s, one myself, and a mexican, and a black. I start out bringing up Obama just to get some one stirred up. It works. Then the other white guy says,no one will vote for a n—er, I’ll edit myself. Then, gasp, f–k you, kkk, and so on, then he says we are getting rid of all of them anyway. I say, yeah, and the mexican’s are next, more gasp,f–k you, and racist, then they say, what about your wife, she’s chinese, nah, they can stay, we like their restaurants, and their laundry’s, f–k you, so on, and so on. The bell rings, we go back in laughing it up, and continue to work together, and bash each other through out the night. They didn’t care, black, and mexican, and us whites didn’t care what they said in return. Its the ones that cry about everything all the time that are the true racist. Thank you, Mac. Warrior, please keep posting. This is awesome stuff. And stay off the medication – the posts are just that much better. Thanks. Thank you, entertaining, isn’t it. you guys can’t help but love me. I’m just a big cuddly Lib basher. The only med’s I take is anti reds. Warrior: “John Scalzion , Hit a nerve, annoy, one and the same.
Dem’s don’t like it when the truth slaps them in the face.” I’m not a Democrat, for one thing (registered independent since I could vote because I think political parties are not a good idea). And what’s annoyed me is not your political views but the fact that you don’t aggregate your posts (and are still not doing so, which means either you didn’t understand what I asked you to do, or you’re just a bit of a dick). So you’re wrong on both counts. Mac, Why are you still going on about blacks, and swimming, and race. Because I disagree with what you said about blacks, swimming, race, and about Corby Kennard.  I thought that was clear? John Scalzi,    ” I’m not a Democrat, for one thing registered independent ” But who did you vote for? I’d say it was a Democrat by how you take offense so easy, and by your reply’s. You argue like a Lib also, calling names,  I guess because I hit a nerve, or annoyed you so. Anyone that would vote for a Republican would support me, so you must be brand X. Or is it brand RED. I have voted both ways, but haven’t found a Dem worth voting for, for along time, and after seeing the NEW breed, I probably will never vote Dem again, unless you can find another JFK. Just your big penis. See, I’m polite. Warrior, I would suggest you head over to Baen’s Bar where you will find lots of people who hold the same opinion that you do over the stuff that you have railed about here. You can sign up for the Bar at http://bar.baen.com/ Warrior: “But who did you vote for?” Last election, I voted for a mix of each. Lately I’ve trended more toward Democrats, but lots of people could say that, which is part of the problem the GOP has these days. As for nerve-hitting: Not really. You argue poorly, read off a conservative talk radio check list, insult people like you’re Newt Gingrich’s mentally-challenged younger brother and make more than the number of typos that can be chalked up to random error. You don’t rate access to my nerves. You don’t think or write well enough for that. My major concerns with you are that you don’t offend my other guests and that you don’t post multiple sequential comments. Now, I understand you’re very impressed with yourself, and that’s fine; good for you. But you should know this is does not oblige me to feel the same. But I’ll tell you what, Warrior. Since you seem to feel that you rate some special access to my attention, I’ll offer you this challenge. I’ve just stuck you into my moderation queue. Your challenge is to write something I actually think is worth responding to, on the merits of its argument. If you do, I’ll let it out. If you don’t, I won’t. As extra incentive, each time you attempt to post and I find your argument wanting, I’ll remove one of your previous posts. I’ll start on the ones I’ve found most egregiously stupid and spiral out from there. Since apparently you know how to get on my nerves, you should know how not to do it, too. So, go on, Warrior: Impress me. Patrick V: Why would you wish this dude on Baen’s Bar? I pointed Warrior to Baen’s Bar because as I said in my post he echoes what a lot of the regular high volume posters say over there. There are people over asking if Barack really is a US citizen. It has since been definitively answered that he is, but that doesn’t stop them from fervently wishing that the ‘Obamination’ that is somehow proven that he is not. One poster even started a thread that since he thinks Obama is virtually certain to win the White House and that the ‘Demoncrats’ will have significant gains in both House and Senate, that they will a) raise taxes, b) nationalize healthcare, c) implement serious restrictions on gun ownership, etc. The poster then asks for odds on how long it would take for there to be enough of a groundswell that open rebellion would break out and a new civil war will take place. (Beyond the initial post I did not read the thread.) Maybe on Baen’s Bar he can find some people who will be impressed with him as you said. @319 Yo, race is a social construct, remember? What you be talking about? So is finance. And we have WHOLE NEWSPAPERS about it. University degrees even.  :-) Warrior, you claim you’re not racist, and yet you find it acceptable to make racist jokes? Racist jokes about your own wife?! Hate to break it to you, but you are racist. Hell, if my boyfriend was privy to  conversation like that and someone made a crack at my ethnicity (or sex, or gender, etc), and he didn’t defend me? He’d consider himself lucky if all he got was an earful from me about it. Jenna: “Hate to break it to you, but you are racist.” And a bit of an ass. That said, Warrior’s in the penalty box at the moment, and won’t be coming out unless/until he writes something I find intellectually acceptable, so addressing questions to him right now is probably a bit of a loss. Warrior writes, in a post that’s not getting out of moderation: “You can argue, that I don’t argue well, like the rest of your bloggers do, but none of you have agrued any better than I.” Well, that’s not true, as I have argued better than you have, for one. You are free to disagree, but inasmuch as your arguments to this point have been filled with implication, assumption, bad facts and hackneyed rhetoric, you’ll understand if I privilege my own estimation above yours. As an example of your poor arguing skills, I’ll pull another quote out of not-to-be-released-from-moderation post, in which you ask me, apropos to a possible President Obama: “Can you tell me do you want to be taxed more?” The implication being that if Obama becomes president, my taxes will go up. Well, in fact, under Obama’s proposed tax plan, my taxes wouldn’t go up, nor would the taxes of the vast majority of Americans. Indeed, under Obama’s proposed plan, they would go down just a bit. Go me.  So asking me if I want to taxed more doesn’t apply; I won’t be. Chances are very good, Warrior, given the general distribution of income here in the US, that you wouldn’t be paying more either. Mind you, I don’t think you’re actually interested in whether I personally will be paying more in taxes; I suspect you’ve just plopped the statement out there to offer up the implication that taxes for the average person generally will go up under Obama, which in fact they wouldn’t. So either you’re ignorant of Obama’s actual tax plan, in which case you’re arguing poorly (arguing from ignorance is not good arguing), or you know the details of the Obama tax plan, and you’re choosing to dishonestly frame the question, in which case you’re arguing poorly, and you’re being offensive about it, since you’re making the assumption I don’t know the details of the plan, i.e., that I’m ignorant. Which I don’t appreciate. Beyond that one example, the rest of your entry is likewise filled with the sort of bad logic and unsupported assertions that just compound my opinion that you simply don’t know how to argue, and that it’s not worth my time to try to correct each example of your ignorance and/or dishonesty, and your further arguments don’t rate to appear on this site. So there it is. However, you are welcome to try again. Allow me to make the following recommendations. 1. Try to focus on the subject at hand, the subject being the one that the original entry was on. 2. Try not to ramble for nearly a thousand words, as you did in the entry I’m not letting out of moderation. If you must ramble on that long, please learn about the subtle joys of paragraphs. 3. I’m generally not a fascist when it comes to correct spelling and grammar in comments, since most of them are written quickly. But come on, sir. If you have the time to write a thousand words, you have time to clean up your writing afterward. Your arguments are poor enough without, as an example, having to have the word “boarders” stand in for “borders.” Now, I understand you believe that your being in moderation is an example of how I only want like-minded folks here, but if you visit other threads here, you’ll find lots of folks who disagree with me politically have nice, long, complex and interesting discussions with people who disagree with them. It’s not your politics that dropped you in the moderation queue; it’s your inability to argue well combined with your puffed-up misapprehension that my unwillingness to engage your bad arguments somehow meant you were winning. Try again. Try better. Warrior: Nope, your latest attempt was no better. You’re a bit of a loss, I’m afraid. Since we’ve come to the point where all that’s happening on this thread is a vaguely trollish character trying to get past moderation, I’ll go ahead and close the comments. Warrior, because I’m closing this thread, you’re out of the moderation queue, but do try better on other threads. I don’t want to have to moderate your ass all over my site. If I have to do it too much, I’ll just blacklist you and have done with it. Comments are closed.

Fox addresses baby mama drama: Producer used "poor judgment" Since Salon's Alex Koppelman caught Fox News characterizing Michelle Obama as "Obama's Baby Mama," there's been an uproar over use of such an offensive term.

ORIGINAL REPORT:
As if implicating her as one half of a "terrorist fist jab" wasn't enough, Fox News has gone on to label Michelle Obama "Obama's baby mama." Salon's Alex Koppelman writes:  An alert reader wrote in just a little while ago to let us know about something he'd spotted on Fox News Wednesday afternoon. During a segment discussing conservative attacks against Michelle Obama, the wife of presumptive Democratic nominee Barack Obama, the network described the former as "Obama's baby mama." I checked, and sure enough, as you can see below, our e-mailer was right. In fact, that description was displayed on screen several times during the segment, which featured anchor Megyn Kelly and conservative blogger Michelle Malkin, an FNC contributor.  Koppelman has the video here, and you can see the stills below.   To be fair, Michelle Obama referred to Barack as her "baby's daddy" on the night he won his Senate seat in 2004.

 Fox addresses baby mama drama: Producer used 'poor judgment' - : Fox addresses baby mama drama: Producer used 'poor judgment' Reader Comments (139) Archives Categories Contact   Navigate:  Share this Article Multimedia   Find stories by: June 12, 2008 Categories: Pages Pages News Tip Sheets Policy More Info  Since Salon's Alex Koppelman caught Fox News characterizing Michelle Obama as "Obama's Baby Mama," there's been an uproar over use of such an offensive term. 

“A producer on the program exercised poor judgment in using this chyron during the segment,” Fox's Senior Vice President of Programming Bill Shine said in a statement to Politico. 

In addition to being insulting, the phrase "baby mama" is also inaccurate. The Urban Dictionary defines "baby mama" as"the mother of your child(ren), whom you did not marry and with whom you are not currently involved."

Although Shine doesn't name anyone responsible, the show's producer is Jessica Herzberg. A Fox staffer said that others internally were bothered by describing the potential first lady and very accomplished women — as the senator's "baby mama."

Unfortunately for the network, this comes just days after Fox's E.D. Hill addressed her use of the phrase "terrorist fist jab" on-air in reference to the famous Michelle-Barack fist bump (or pound) made just before his celebratory speech in St. Paul. (Screenshot from Koppelman's piece) Does anyone seriously consider FOX a legitimate news station?  Come on they are nothing more than
sleezy tabloid entertainment.  The WWF is more credible. Never mind that Michelle Obama called Barack her "baby daddy". McCain's campaign should have to file a supplemental report with the FEC and acknowledge it's been receiving political advertising from FOX.

And FOX "News" should be forced to label these broadcasts as the advertisements that they are. Come on...first the "terrorist fist jab" and now this? FOX News, this is truly getting ridiculous.  The Obama's are a hardworking, AMERICAN couple who have worked towards the AMERICAN dream, just as all of us try to do.  Stop this shameful ingnorant Obama bashing. Let me clearly understand this...Fox News want us to believe that they are "fair and balanced." Well did they call Cindy the McCain's baby mama. Clearly his first wife could be called that. Unfortunately, no mention (negative) have been highlighted on their broadcast...curious how they repeat things about Obama that is unfair and clearly unbalanced. Personally, I would like to watch a Fox broadcasst that leans towards accurate and honest. Is that a slogan they can get their heads around? Is that asking too much...Accurate and honest...? I expected dirty politics as usual not this level of stupidity. FOX network should be embarrassed. Because I am embarrassed for them. Uh, no. Michelle Obama described her husband as "her baby's daddy." There is a big difference - there is nothing perjorative in that. Regarding the posting above by Roger Stone, Michelle Obama introduced her husband at a campaign event as my BABY'S daddy, not as you incorrectly stated. The 's makes a big difference that you conviently ommitted. What a blatant race baiting ploy. Fox News is really stupid if they think that this kind of racism will attract many people to John McCain. It'll only serve to push away viewers who don't want to be associated with such racist idiocy - including many McCain supporters. america is racist, these people have achieved so much and still have to listen this sht. shame, shame. Would anyone know fox existed if their stupidity wasn't reported? In the history of broadcast and cable journalism, has anyone ever heard a U.S. Senator's wife and possible First Lady referred to as a "Baby Mama"? Fox News preaches "family values" conservatism, even often gets on a high moral horse, and lectures the "black community" about taking "responsibility." Well, black America gives them Barack and Michelle Obama - married, apparently faithful, two beautiful children. What does Fox News give in return: a sexist, racist slur calling Michelle Barack's "Baby Mama." These people have no shame. Fox and its right-wing radio contingent have been doing this I-dare-you-to-accuse-us-of-being-racist dance ever since Obama annouced as a candidate. It obviously plays well with a large segment of their demographic or they wouldn't dare. O'Reilly & Hannity virtually froth at the mouth over Obama - leading with false and inaccurate stories about Obama for months and months - this is nothing new - it's very disappointing but we expect it from Fox!
Oh and this is clearly SEXIST & RACIST for all you Clinton "fans"! I'll live with the comment as long as they refer to Cindy McCain as "Sugar Mama" Discipline?  Anyone see anything Faux Noise's comments about ANY repurcussions for this b.s.?  Of course not.  Mistakes happen.  Repeated mistakes (of the same kind) + no accountability = intentional. Michelle Obama introduced her husband as "my babies' daddy". 

They have two beautiful daughters and she was referring to both of them. Faux News, like the GOP, is a stinking, rotting corpse. Okay, time for a mouth breather to exclaim, "but Faux has the highest ratings in the entire world" in 5...4...3...2....1 Keep it up Fox Noise.  Really, do not stop.  Give your target audience of old white men, all the red meat they want, without any of the filler. I THINK SINCE M.O. INTRODUCED HIM AS BABY DADDY THEN WHY THE OUT CRY?
WHAT ABOUT THE " BRO'S before HO'S" SHIRTS THAT OBAMA SUPPORTERS WERE WEARING? SAYING HILLARY IS A WHORE! THAT'S ACCEPTABLE TO HIS FOLLOWERS. what if everyone boycotted all companies that advertise on fox? Fox news is a disgrace. They are the GOP racist mouthpiece. This channel needs to be fined for its outrage. I own air space, correct? A stiff fine might remind FOX that there are people who care about the truth...and are fair and balanced. She said he was her "babies' daddy." It's different. There's a disturbing pattern emerging here. I (through Google News) saw a report on Wisconsin and Obama from Fox Business News.  It's "headline" was critical of Obama for Wisconsin business.  When I looked at the article I saw it was a press release made and "paid for" by the GOP.  Fox put it out as a news story.  Since it said it was paid for by the GOP, I think Fox should disclose how much they were paid to put it out and explain to readers how they can consider it a "news" story instead of the blatant propaganda it really is! Fox is a tabloid station For those who are defending this nonsense by reminding us all that Michelle Obama has used the term before, I would like to point out one thing. Michelle Obama is NOT a nationally televised news outlet. You are neglecting key elements in this issue: context and intent. I may affectionately refer to my well-to-do friends jokingly as "corporate pimps." I would be outraged to see that term used by a news outlet to describe them while reporting on their chosen professions. "There's a disturbing pattern emerging here."  There is no emerging pattern.  "Fair and Balanced" Fox is blatantly playing the race card.  How very white of them.... Boycott Fox...and its sponsors!  I stopped watching months ago and am glad I did!  Haven't missed it at all!  FOX....worst news in the world!  As Keith would say! The sun rises in the east, sets in the west, and Fox programs are a crock. How long will be required to take "poor judgment" as the excuse to allow the racist demagogues at FOX to continue spouting off?

Where is the accountability?  Here's how this works: ED Hill was going to get bumped, so why not let her make the "terrorist fist jab" comment when they were going to take her off the air anyway?

How about the prior assassination comment?  How about O'Reilly's "lynching party" comment toward Michelle?

This is beyond repeated poor judgment, it is a pattern of intentional race baiting scripted and condoned at the very highest levels of the network.

Free Speech?  What's next? Obviously that was inappropriate and unprofessional. BUT, what's with the double standard? It's acceptable for Obama to make sexist and racist remarks and for Michelle to make un-american comments? Oh, I get it, Obama's different, he's for change. He's not accountable for anything. Has anyone compiled a list of Fox advertisers?  That would come in really handy just about now.... You guys need to lightent up. I'm sure Fox will call Cindy John McCain's "Sugar Mama," given how fair and balanced they are. Ol' Lefty, this Fox Busines News story you saw was a word-for-word repetition of a GOP press release?  Did they disclose that at any point?  Can you post the link for the story? Despicable comes to mind.  It is part  of an emerging pattern from FOX of the basest racist slurs against the Obamas.  This is intolerable from a organization that thinks of itself of  as a news group.  They should make apologies and corrections hourly for a month, and fire anyone who was connected with this filth. Please don't ask Fox to stop.  I love Keith Olbermann's Countdown and watch it faithfully.  So what Fox does is just make it easier for Keith to do his show.  A good GOP friend keeps recommending Faux Noise to me, but all I need to do is watch Countdown, Jon Stewart's The Daily Show, Steve Colbert's The Colbert Report, and I'll get to see all of the really idiotic things that Faux seems to come up with every day.  

Aging Reader The producer needs to be fired right now.  No more questions asked. Just because Obama's BLACK, he gets a free ride. AMERICA is supposed to elect a man as president of the U.S., who refers to Wright (a crazy racist nutcase),
as his uncle, and his white grandmother as a typical white woman. What would you jerks do on this website, if a republican called Obama, a typical black man??
You would scream RACIST RIGHT_WING JERK!!  America will go into the booths on November 4th., and vote for John McCain.  Why?  Because, they are scared ****less of the unknown stranger, who has lots of shadey friends, and took weeks to get rid of his psycho racist pastor, who he hid in the basement
to pray.  Why is it that everyone is fair game to CRITISIZE, except Mr. Barack Obama?????????????????
WHY???????????????????????????????
MSNBC, and CNN have always been in the tank for Obama.  Mathews and Olberman are Radical Liberals. No one cares.  They have the lowest ratings on cable news.

Who really cares what Mrs. Obama has to say?  If FOX news is so wicked, then why is it the highest rated cable news station, year after year??

Because everyone watches it. But why? Are you calling the majority of the American people STUPID???


I am a Hillary supporter, who is defecting to the republicans. There are 17 million of us, plus the independents, and republicans who WILL vote for McCain.

Wake up, we don't trust Barack, and we don't like him.  That is our perogative.  The PEOPLE will decide, and you represent very little, and don't even know it. If someone at Fox is not fired over this, the apology means nothing. Really....does anybody watch FOX Noise anymore? They are just the worst cable news show ever! That is why Keith Olberman is knocking O'Reilley off out of the park in the ratings!! Just horrible journalists (if you can call them that)....Hannity, O'Reilley, The Beltway Boys, Carl Rove is on there every night. What a flippin nightmare channel. Just laughable! I cannot believe this was a mistake! This is why we continue to have some people acting in this manner because of antics like such.
Fox news should be more than ashame for putting that nonsense out there. It shows no matter how professional you are people want to think of you in a bad light based on their ignorance. Once again Fox news makes the list for stupidity! Great job....not! That's becuase Fox is a bunch of jerks.  They use their t.v. channel to spew right wing, racist, anti-gay, crap all the time.  A bunch of air head blondes, white old men, you've got fox.  I don't even add the word news next to Fox.  It's not news. Does anyone seriously consider FOX a legitimate news station? Come on they are nothing more than sleezy tabloid entertainment. The WWF is more credible. 

Posted By: Nadine | June 12, 2008 at 01:29 PM ********************************* Who are you trying to kid? FOX is the number one cable news outlet. Hi. I'm Michelle. Barack is my husband. These are my daughters, and he's my daughters'(babies) daddy. (THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS SAYING.) O'Reilly has never "foamed at the mouth" over Obama.  He has been more than fair to him. "Never mind that Michelle Obama called Barack her "baby daddy"."

Yes indeed, nevermind it, because what she said was that he was her "baby's daddy" which, while still something of a slang, is neither grammatically incorrect nor implying that her children are illegitimate.

But please, do continue living in Michelle Malkin's echo chamber.  I'm sure it's far more comfortable in there for you than out here, where this sort of thing is despicable. Agenda driven news will always be vunerable to this sort of thing. It's just too tempting to try and be cute. Mrs Obama, or Michele Obama, or the Senators wife were all ways to describe her that would be good enough. Oh, but no, they need to give their viewers some red meat. They end up looking like meatheads. There really won't be too much fallout from this.  Fake Noise gets to say, oops, our bad, huh huh, nothing to see here, and that's that.

Now, if CNN called John Mccain an impotent old *******, the avalanche of right wing outrage would be too large to catalog.  

But since it's Fake Noise that did it, we expect them to sink to the lowest levels imaginable on a daily basis.

First it was a 'terrorist fist jab' now this.  It just goes to show how scared the right wing noise machine is of Obama; they have to result to name calling as they cannot take him down on his record or his character.  How long before they call him a ************ or ni$$er because you know that's coming too. Do you think we'd ever see this:

OUTRAGED CONSERVATIVES: STOP PICKING ON MCCAIN'S DRUG HO! Thank you Politico for calling Fox News on their slanderous coverage of Michelle Obama. The program producer should be suspended immediately and Megyn Kelly needs to make a public apology to the Obama family. This was completely unacceptable, both sexist and racist. And to think that some people, my Republican mother included, continue to insist that Fox is a dispassionate source of hard news. There is a big difference between Michelle using the term "baby daddy" in jest, and a major new network using it to quantitfy someone. FAUX News or FOX Noise, as I like to call them, are really having a hard time with the idea that someone other than a  older white male, could possibly be president. In their attempt to try to diminish the character of the Obama's they are losing their viability as a credible new source. It is bad enough that they have two hacks in Sean Hannity and  Bill O'Reily disguised as journalists. In essence they are Rupert Murdoch's attack dogs, and this "baby mama" FAUX pas, is yet another attempt to make Obama seem to urban to middle "white America". A both rmp and hajo correctly stated:

Michelle Obama said "here's my BABY'S daddy Clearly this is another case of the scrutiny that Obama and unfortunately his wife have to deal with. I'm curious to see what McCain and his supporters have geared up for. I feel that the prejudice and discrimination that Obama would be percieved to be attacked with hasn't surfaced. While this is a pessimistic view, i feel that attacks on Obama's race or religion haven't reached what i would be assumed they be. I am an Obama supporter and to be quite honest, I'm looking for a little bit of this racism to head Obama's way. I think him running for president with a more than 50% chance of winning will be even more slighted his way with McCain or any of his supporters to slip and say something directly to Obama. Soon americans on the average will realize what the system and what people across the nation deal with. I'll finish from earlier, In short what i'm saying is that if Obama's opponents slip up, i think the people of america will shy away from that sort of stupidity and irrogance and cast their vote for obama, not as a sympathy vote but simply because they are tired of the country going that way.

Also, Fox News is a terrible media outlet, i completely agree with the WWF comment and i'll add that the Daily Show and the Colbert Report, which are comedy news shows are more accurate than Fox News.

Obama. This is exactly the type of stuff that will be coming from the Right this whole election, no matter how hard they try to keep it bottled up.

There's no way that certain people on the right will be able to hide the fact that they're focused on Obama's race and want to talk about it.

Watching closet bigots struggle to stay in the closet the next five months (and four, eight years) will be hilarious.

Can we just start calling this type of gaffe a "Ferraro"? OOPS!

Punctuation correction to my previous post.

I wrote that Michelle Obama introduced her husband as "my BABY'S daddy".

It should have read:  "my BABIES' daddy" --

-- in the plural form of the word "baby" since the Obamas have *2* kids. to FOX - "Stop this shameful ingnorant Obama bashing."

But they are democrats so FOX thinks it is okay.  

The fact that the Obama's combined IQ's probably exceed the total on the FOX executive floor is irrelevant It seems to me that Fox's MO for this campaign is to make these kind of comments and then apologize for it.  Meanwhile, the damage is done because no one remembers the apology. This was bad, no doubt, but can I bring up, say, MSNBC? Fox is watched more than all other cable news networks combinded! They do make mistakes, but they generally cover both sides of the argument, which is more than any of the other so-called newtworks can say. Will someone please tell White people we don't call White people, 'whitey'.  That's what caricatured 60's Black Panthers called White people.  NO Black person under 60 would use the term Whitey or Cracker or Ofay. It is a term that some White people ( over 50) think we use in private.  The very fact that it is used shows just how false it is. Oh goodness, you people are so hurt! Bleed, bleed... And yes, "babies' daddy" is SO completely different. The two are totally unrelated. Get a grip. Fox will have all its broadcast licenses challenged after 2008's elections are over. A wonderful thing indeed. I find it hilarious that nobody talks about McCain's Sugar Mama. Nadine, does anyone consider Fox a legitimate news stattion?  Why yes I do. Do you liberals consider MSNBC/NBC legitimate?  When Matthews starts reporting new without referencing the thrills up his leg and Olby stops calling our soldiers and the President "murders" at the same time they are anchoring election coverage then you can talk.  You Foc news bashers are hypocrites or as Michelle Obama would say Goddam American hypocrite. Not that I like even coming to this junkyard, but this is more like an apology and an "explanation" here than any kind of perspective.

Trashy behavior excused on a trashy website. WAAAAAAAAAAAAA, WAAAAAAAAAAAA Fox honchos are: 

Troubled by: a bunch of dumba**es who tried to cop the hip lingo and failed miserably.

Not troubled by: Commentary by discredited bigot and stalker of chronically ill eleven-year-olds, Michelle Malkin. Is FOX the only channel you zombies receive? If not, haven't you figured out how to change the channel. What a group of loosers on this thread, get a life! Michelle Obama called Barack Obama her "Baby's Daddy".  Just a TINY bit different, but what to ethics and standards and integrity matter to FOX and Republicans.  Hey,  we're getting our ass kicked...time to start scraping the bottom of the barrel as usual.  Wonder why only 25% of the country will even admit to being Republicans....If you want something new, a President that will not lie to you and lie to go to war, go visit www.barackobama.com and read his views, read the blogs and see what people who know him think.  He is a very good human being, and it is time we had one in the White House.    It has been WAY too long. TRUE BLUE:  Referred to on this blog as Cindy McCain being John McCain's "DRUG HO".

Where is the outrage.  Not one comment, but mine, condemning this
discusting sexist slur against McCain's wife.  I hope she sues the
pants off of you, TRUE BLUE, for 
defemation of character, and slander, etc.

If the tables were turned, and anyone called Michelle Obama a "HO", we would have WW111, race riots, and America would be burned to the ground in defense of her.

This is ourageous.  Say something against this kind of hateful remarks!!!  

What are you all hypocrytical COWARDS on this blog, with yellow streaks running down your back???

Say something against this, my fellow Americans!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fox Senior Vice President, BILL SHINE said in a statement to Politico...

"Bill Shine"?  You have got to be kidding me. FOX is a disgrace. I am an African American female college professor from a well-off suburban background who nevertheless has white students who assume I'm from the "hood." Being from an inner-city or impoverished environment is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of; however, racists will constantly "ghettoize" successful African Americans regardless of what we achieve in order to diminish our accomplishments. This kind of commentary merely exacerbates that tendency. So what's gonna happen to that ho Jessica Herzberg (who no doubt wouldn't take offense at the adjective, cool and hip as she be)? I was outraged about this until I read the CNN transcript of election night 2004, when Michelle Obama introduced her husband, the senator-elect of Illinois as "Barack Obama, my babies' daddy."

I figure if it's cool for Michelle then it's cool for Fox. Look, Michelle Obama could have introduced her husband, the new senator, as "the father of my children." But she consciously chose a variant of the more lower socioeconomic, AA, "my baby daddy" construction. Fine. Then let's not take Fox to task for doing the same thing.

And if people look at that transcript of CNN's election night coverage in 2004, they'll see that after talking about how "fired up" he was, among the first people he thanked was his pastor, Jeremiah Wright. CAN WE MOVE 'FOGS NOOZE' OFF-SHORE...? Fox news, what a sewer. I'm waiting for Geraldine Ferraro to denounce this misogynist slur against a hard-working and accomplished female. Uh, Geraldine...?? First Liz Trotta, a contributor of Fox News, makes an assassination joke about Sen. Obama and now we have to put up with Fox News assassinating Michelle Obama's character! They are a disgusting example of a news station. It doesn't matter what Michelle Obama calls her husband, FOX shouldn't be using those terms. Senator McCain has called his wife something I won't even dare print here...would that make it OK for FOX to use? gree with Oliver Willis.  Faux should just call it as they would prefer and call her the N word and call it a day. How many of you people complained when Hillary was called a "whore", or "f*in whore" "lesbian" "dyke" etc?
not too many I bet. I am sooo sick of reading all of these racist comments and ignorant half wits who continue to defend Hillary Clinton.  In case you haven't gotten the press release, Barack Obama is the presumptive nominee and his wife does deserve respect!  To say that Obama has gotten a free ride??? You CANNOT be serious!  Only a trained monkey with the I.Q. of a plastic doorknob would make such an idiotic assertion.  I'm so sick of the racism.  You think that we as a supposedly progressive country, would be beyond such ignorance and stupidity. FOX News is a DISGRACE!!!  For the record, I would NEVER, EVER vote for John McCain . . . not even if my brain was extracted forcefully!!!!!!! Nadine:
Better than CNN, MSNBC and all 3 networks combined.  They are all shills for Obama.
I dont see you cry'n about the continual stream of mouth diarrhea
from "newsman" keith olbermann. Wait, stop?how can this be racist?  I watched when Obama won his Senate seat and was amazed when his wife introduced him as your new Senator from Illinois, ?My baby Daddy, Barack Obama!?

Is this another instance where some can say it but others can?t?  Was she just reassuring us in case us racists white folk had any doubt? 

Check the meaning of Baby Daddy on the Urban Dictionary!

There is video of this if anyone wants to find it -- probably at Fox!
David Nadine, you probably watch "legitimate" news stations like MSNBC and CNN...  Well, at least they have 1 viewer. This is part of a despicable pattern from GOP TV.

They're only fooling the stupid. May we ask Obama on Father's Day  "Who's your Daddy?" Fred Stone, read Critical Thinker below.

As CT said one might in jest refer to a beloved spouse out of name or with some slang term.  But a supposed news organization treating a high achieving, decent hard-working, person like Michelle, our future First Lady, God willing, in this disrespectful manner is asinine and highly insulting.  And if you had sense, you'd recognize the difference. Poor judgment ?you think? more like the same old racist stereotyping. Someone need to be fired!
I am fed up with this type of broadcasting.  ?Terrorist fist jab? now ?Baby mama? what?s next? Nevertheless  these remarks speaks volume of Fox?s News. My baby Daddy, = my baby's Daddy.  (we just got through another one of these idiotic misquote kerfuffles).

Faux News is both stupid and vicious; two sides of the same political coin. Funny how none of the other networks seem to make these kind of gaffs weekly - and Fox only seems to make them when talking about Obama. Wishing him assassinated, "confusing" his name with Osama (repeatedly), The terrorist fist jab, and now this? Fair and Balanced? Please. Faux News is controlled by the Republican Party. The network is an embarrassment.

What other outlet would employ Karl Rove, a man who should be in prison for crimes against the United States, as a political commentator? Ok... seriously.  Let me be the first to say that I believe the position of president deserves respect for the person holding that position and their family.  
Obama has not reached that position yet, but I do believe that some respect is owed to him and his family.  Fox news crossed a line here, but I DO think they were attempting to bring back attention to the comment that Michelle made about her "babies' daddy".  

Someone said to look at the transcript and prove that she said baby's and not baby.  First, the transcript does in fact say "baby's".  Are we to assume, then, using the transcript as the end all be all that Michelle intended to imply that her husband was only the father to ONE of her children since she used a singular form?  Of course not.  So, let's not rely 100% on a transcript.  Michelle WAS referring to this low-class slang term when she said it.  She usually carries herself much higher than that.

She could very easily have chosen different words if her goal were simply to reference her children.  Please don't insult us with trying THAT argument.

It was disgusting for Fox to use the term and it was disgusting for the potential first lady to use that term.  Both should be ashamed. "The WWF is more credible."
Awesome! If "Fred Stone" cant see the racism dripping from the inaccurate use of a race-freighted term to demean Michelle Obama, he is naive.  My guess is that anyone defending Fox on this or the 'terrorist fist bump' are in the tank for right wing lunacy.  Sad Why aren't women furious over this comment? Isn't this sexist? I think that this is pretty low class and race-baiting by Fox News.

But I think that those that make a distinction between baby's daddy and baby daddy are being ridiculous.  It is exactly the same thing.  

I do think that there is a difference between Michelle Obama making that statement than Fox News putting doing it. One of the comments says that she has read the transcript of CNN and it says that Michelle Obama said my baby's daddy not my babies daddy. That is used as proof that she was using slang.  Tell me, how could CNN know whether Michelle was saying baby's or babies' daddy.  Can they read her mind since the two words sound exactly the same?  Maybe the CNN transcript is a mistake.  Either way there is no excuse for a newstation to call any woman baby momma, much less one who is educated, successful, and accomplished.  Fox calls themselves a news station and for those of you who want to defend them, there is nothing to defend.  This is just blatant racist and sexist propoganda.  I don't agree with this type of journalism no matter who the target is.  For those of you who think you are watching news, you really need to realize that you are watching something that more closely resembles the National Enquirer. Just because Barry "Punished her with a Baby!" Oh drat. Not only is Fox the number one CHOICE in cable news, but now they're reporting that America might just be WINNING THE TERROR WAR IN IRAQ. It's enough to make you wish for the old days when you had Nancy Reagan arround to make fun of.

Barack Obama's half brother Malik said Thursday that if elected his brother will be a good president for the Jewish people, despite his Muslim background. 

In an interview with Army Radio he expressed a special salutation from the Obamas of Kenya. 

Is this another dastardly Fox trick? I wouldn't mind "baby mama" as much if they also referred to McCain's wife as "trophy babe" Fox News:
Long a  tool of the Republican message
is once again trying to "Swift Boat"
the Democratic candidate with offensive 
and untruthful slogans. Words matter!
Lets have some truth come out of the media!
And SPIN, SOUND BITES THAT ARE LIES Why is Michell Makin still on the air.  This "racist" needs to be yanked from broadcasting, immediately. "Tell me, how could CNN know whether Michelle was saying baby's or babies' daddy. Can they read her mind since the two words sound exactly the same? Maybe the CNN transcript is a mistake. "

I guess I still don't get the distinction between baby daddy, baby's daddy, and babies' daddy.  To me they are all derived from the same slang.

I guess in my mind when a lot of people say they are not racist, this is true in a lot of ways, but I think they are still uncomfortable with black culture.  I think that's why only someone like Barack, who doesn't "act black" or "talk black" is in the position to run for president.

And I think this type of stuff does hurt him, whether it's Michelle Obama saying "baby's daddy", or him brushing the dirt off his shoulders etc. When this type of crap comes out of a preacher it's ok.  It's even ok to listen to him preach for 20 years.  But a news organization should be above reproach.  You want a Obama love fest then go to MSNBC. Ahhh, isn't the Liberal mentality refreshing.

Posted By: Dr. Marti Hunsucker yes, people do take Fox seriously. They are called Republicans and a lot of them live in Texas. Evan:

I can't speak to the majority of Americans being stupid, but if you really were a Hillary supporter, and you really are planning to vote for McCain, then that would certainly put you in that category. I supported Hillary, and I'm still seething at how she was treated (although admittedly she could have run a better campaign), but I'm sure not going to vote for 4 more years of Bush lite. Latte-drinking liberals claim that Obama and his wife were married for six years before they had their first child.  They also claim that Michelle Obama is a "Princeton educated lawyer".  Conservatives insinuate that Michelle Obama is a crack ho that had illegitimate children with Barack.

Both sides of the debate are on equal footing.  Conservatives are entitled to their opinions because they are conservatives, not because they are supported by so-called "facts".  It's fine to make up news items as long as they conform to racist Republican stereotypes.

Why don't liberals like fair and balanced news coverage? This is the network that our illustrious vice president demands to have preset on his hotel room TV when he is traveling.  Nuff said. To rip off a great line from Dennis Miller, the color of the Obama's skin isn't an issue but the thinness of their skin is a worry. Some people go out of their way to be "outraged" because it is to their advantage to do so. I expected more than a tired, cynical ploy from the liberal messiah who is supposed to be all about change and hope. This is really sad.  A network that claims to be a "news" network has to resort to inaccurate name calling to try to scare the American public about an upstanding citizen and his family.  If the person at Fox who called Michelle Obama's baby mama did it out of ignorance, she should be fired.  Obviously she is not qualified for her job.  This is unacceptable and should result in severe punishment of the person responsible for the false label. 'poor judgment' is not an apology, it's a commendation. I understand 'poor judgment' is a required qualification found in every job announcement for fox nuwz.  Just say'n. It's out there you know. Now maybe some of Obama's supporters see how Hillary supporters feel when CNN,NBC AND MSNBC bashed Hillary and bill thru the primaries,now Obama's camp wants them to help him by campaining,I hope they let him ;lose on his own,poor canditate,the best one is out,now no substance to listen too.MCCain is sounding better every day.Fox is best and everyone know's that. Fox News MUST be full of IDIOTS! Fire the ******* and apologize to Barack and Michelle Obama. Is it not rascit for Obama to refer to a rumor that he is Muslim as a "smear." 

What does that say about Obama's thoughts on another religion? 

The race card works both ways. You have probably never listened once to a broadcast.  You think the networks are not shills for BO. Ha Ha I think people are overreacting. Yeah, this is more like something that Jerry Springer would say, but, within the black community, you hear people jokingly refer to their spouse as their baby daddy or baby mama all the time. And, didn't Michelle introduce Barack, who could be the future president of the United States, as her baby daddy.  Plus, they're the ones doing pumping fists, and brushing dirt off their shoulders, and other things to try to seem cool and hip. If it were BET referring to Michelle as Barack's baby mama, no one would have had a problem with it. Fox is a racist tv station and has racists reporting the news....They are unprofessional, and it really makes the journalisim proffession look unproffesional....The FCC needs to yank them off the air....and how come Cindy McInsane can't be a baby's momma?.....Oh yeah, thats right.....She is Trailor Trash!!!! Um... Typical liberal comments about a news agency that call's 'BOTH' sides on their crap.

Last I checked, Michelle called her husband "My baby Daddy". Wow those racist idiots strike again...How Long?...Not Long! @Dave in NC

(And by the way, in response to a couple of comments above, Michelle called Barack her "babys' daddy" NOT "baby daddy", and in any case is very different from calling a woman a "baby mama".  Just ask around!) I'm not sure how old and/or outside of pop culture some folks seem to be here, but let's run through it one more time.  My babies' daddy does NOT = Baby Daddy.  My husband also happens to be my babies' daddy.  Another woman's boyfriend might be her babies' daddy.  But a woman's Baby Daddy (while being her babies' daddy,) is a man whose only relationship with her is that of father of her children.  So "Baby Mama" is a term used to describe the relationship of a person who is not your wife, generally not even your ex-wife, not your girlfriend, simply the mother of your children.  You babies' mama on the other hand may well be your wife or girlfriend - or Baby Mama.  While the wording may be similar, the kind of relationship described by Baby Mama or Daddy is a meaningful nuance. exasperated, So, when you introduce your husband, you often refer to him as your babies' daddy?  I know that every time I introduce mine, I certainly don't.  I introduce him as my husband.  When Michelle Obama... the woman hoping to be our country's First Lady, introduced her husband, the speech was dignified and high-class until she made ONE comment:  "My babies' daddy!" 

Now WHY would she choose those words?  Because she was INTENTIONALLY drawing on the same slang nature in use with the term "baby daddy".  It was done purposefully.

Yes, Fox was wrong... but SO was she.  She made herself look bad. ENM - I agree.  I think she was drawing on the slang, and it was a poor word choice that I feel ghettoized her a bit.  Heck, the couple being accused of not being "black" enough, maybe that's what she was going for, who knows.  But the point that there is an important difference in meaning there still stands in any circumstances. My we must be so careful of what we say about the Obama's, yet we can let it rip with the Bush's and the Cheney's.  WHY IS THAT? fox news is a joke!
The comments are ridiculous and show how they are not a credible source for any news. They are just a right wing propaganda machine. Every self respecting person, no matter what side they are on, BOYCOTT fox news and let the dice fall where they may. People like me help make FOX News the highest rated.  I could watch FOX 24 hours if not for other responsibilities.  I love their presenters, commentators and most of their guests. Not only are they trying to associate Obama with street slang and trigger racial stereotyping (or worse) in the minds of their white audience, they are attributing the language to "Outraged Liberals" which is a label designed to characterize anyone who supports Obama or anyone who happens to dislike attacks on his wife.

It's one thing to let bias creep into the delivery of a story, but it's quite another to construct so carefully a message intended to deceive.  There are no outraged liberals calling out, "Stop picking on Obama's baby mama."  This kind of willful distortion can be found only in tabloid journalism.  National Inquirer and Fox News.

The rest of the irony is that the Fox story in its entirety is about whether there will be a backlash if Republicans go after Michele Obama.  While I happen to agree that Michele?s comments are fair game, the program only interviewed one person on this ?issue.?  Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin not only makes the fair game claim, she goes on to characterize Republicans and conservatives as victims of a reverse distortion that attributes all bad publicity about Michele as having originated with them.  Malkin says that only ?gratuitous and cheap shots? having ?nothing to do with what she?s saying? would be out of bounds.  And yet there it is on a banner right below the interview ~ one big fat Cheap Shot.  Astounding really.

The other intriguing element in this story is that Fox presents this coverage as a story about media behavior and political strategy.  Meanwhile they are really just making use of opportunities within the story to repeat the quote from Michele that frankly is no longer news.  This is how to make news out of something from the past, how to keep dredging up the one thing you want everyone to remember.

http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/2008/06/11/fox_obama/index.html?source=refresh I wish to hell I had never heard of Barrack Obama! All this racist garbage on here makes me want to puke! Get over it! He is the sole reason and nothing good can come from this! That's all we are going to hear until he is gone from the stage.
I don't blame him. He's not the one doing this. In fact he's the opposite. But his presence brings out the worst in some people. People just love to hate and this racism crap does nothing but bring out hate and anger. I'm sick of it. I think you guys are crazy.

The "baby momma" comment was totally out of line and I hope Fox makes a more public apology about it. Yes, there may be racists in the organization; I have no idea.

But watch the actual news segments. There may be analysts who disagree with Obama's views, but the vast majority of the comments are hugely complimentary toward him. I disagree with a lot of his policies too, but man, you can't saw he isn't an amazing speaker or that he isn't accomplished. I get excited watching his speeches too, and I'm a libertarian! But I don't see any systematic racist element in the Fox presentations.

And to the commenter who mocked Fox and likes Keith Olbermann... are you kidding? Olbermann is *exactly* the same as the Fox analyts, just with a liberal perspective.  Facebook logo  boyfriend is going to visit baby mama soon  Advertisements  Advertisements

   Jon Scalzi: Back in the day – you know, when presidential candidates were respectably white – news organizations called potential First Ladies “wives.” But now that black folks are running, we can get all funky fresh with the lingo, yo. So it’s basically fine for Fox News to use “Baby Mama” for Michelle Obama, slang that implies a married 44-year-old Princeton-educated lawyer is, to use an Urban Dictionary definition of the term, “some chick you knocked up on accident during a fling who you can’t stand but you have to tolerate cuz she got your baby now.” Because the Obamas are black! And the blacks, they’re all relaxed about that shit, yo. Word up. And anyway, as the caption clearly indicates, it’s not Fox News that’s calling Michelle Obama “Baby Mama,” it’s outraged liberals. Fox News is just telling you what those outraged liberals are saying. They didn’t want to use the term “Baby Mama.” But clearly they had no choice. Meanwhile, over at her personal site, Michelle “Fox News’ Ethnic Shield” Malkin defends Fox News’ use of the “Baby Mama” phrase by essentially making two arguments. First, Michelle Obama once called Barack Obama her “baby’s daddy,” and as we all know, a married woman factually and correctly calling her husband her child’s father is exactly the same as a major news organization calling a potential First Lady some chick what got knocked up on a fling. Second, the term “baby-daddy” has gone out into the common culture; heck, even Tom Cruise was called Katie Holmes’ baby-daddy, you know, when he impregnated her and she subsequently gave birth while the two were not married, which is exactly like what happened between Michelle and Barack Obama, who were married in 1992 and whose first child was born six years later. So by Malkin’s reasoning it’s perfectly fine for Fox News to call Michelle Obama the unmarried mother of Barack Obama’s children because an entirely different phrase has to her mind entered the common culture, and there was this one time that Michelle Obama once uttered something that sounded like that entirely different phrase, which is not the phrase that Fox News used. But wait! Malkin also points to someone in her comment thread saying that one time, Michelle Obama actually used the phrase “baby daddy”! No apostrophe! It’s in a comment thread, so it must be true. Therefore, Michelle Obama apocryphally using a piece of urban slang makes it perfectly okay for Fox News to use an entirely different piece of urban slang. And that’s why, you see, it won’t be a problem for Bill O’Reilly to refer to Barack Obama as “my nigga” on the next O’Reilly Factor.
 I doubt this ridiculousness could've been mocked any better.   Free Daily Email

  Sign #1 your relationship might not be guaranteed eternal wedded bliss: You’re a professional athlete and she’s a cheerleader. Sign #2: She files a paternity suit, and you demand a DNA test before you’ll pay any child support. And sign #3: You’re accused of pulling out her hair, and slamming her head against a marble floor.  That’s the charge brought against Larry Fitzgerald by the mother of his child, former Raiderette Angela Nazario. Nazario claims she brought their 11-month-old son to Fitzgerald’s Phoenix home for a visit, they started arguing. Let’s see how the plaintiff describes how a multimillionaire athlete calmly and maturely handles a disagreement, after the jump.  Via TMZ, Nazario admits she swung at him first in a play fight, and “may have hit his face.” Fitzgerald then turned from playful to enraged, allegedly pushing Nazario down to her knees. She claims he “grabbed me by my hair with both hands on the back of my head very very hard and tossed me across the room.” Later, when she tried to leave with her son, Nazario says Fitzgerald “grabbed the back of my neck and slammed me down on the marble floor … [I] was disoriented for awhile and could not get up, I remember he mumbled something about ‘that’s what happens when you try taking my son away from me.’” As she got in the car to leave she realized she had lost “chunks” of hair. This sounds pretty serious, but Fitzgerald did allegedly suggest she get an abortion. Maybe he’s unclear on how human pregnancies work, and is trying to take care of it himself. Whatever. It’s not like it’s this distraction that’ll cause the Cardinals to lose Saturday. For the curious, some photos of Nazario from her cheerleading days:
