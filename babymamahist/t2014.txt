The rapper initially denied her claims that he broke her nose and damaged her eye socket and now he’s denying any wrong doing, but his Marrying The Game co-star tells another story. Tiffney posted a Bible verse on Instagram along with a photo that suggests she may be afraid to tell the truth about what really went down.   “All I needed to see… Thank u Jesus. Thank u to my family, friends, & supporters.. Nothing more to be said or explained,” she posted. The rapper took a few subliminal shots at his woman when he posted some pics of his first baby’s mother. “Baby Mama (no drama). #EveryNiggaNeedOneOfThese,” he wrote. He also posted a lengthy tribute to his former love last Thursday. #ThrowbackThursday 2003′ in Compton…. baby mama @aleskaj 5 months pregnant with my 1st born@harlemcarontaylor. 2 years before “The Documentary” dropped. No Dr. Dre, no money…. Just the determination to become a millionaire before he was born so that I could take care of him & his mama the right way… Stopped sellin dope for a minute & taught myself how to rap…. Went thru some tough times… Sh*t I remember when @aleskaj used to split her $150 “Hot Dog On A Stick” paycheck with me. Seems like it was just yesterday, now my lil man bout to be 11 years old !!!! Where the f**k does the time go ??? Always remember, start living your dream TODAY or end up helping someone else live theirs – The Game,” he posted.   POLL: Who do you believe?

  French Montana “Feeling Great” After Khloe Kardashian Split — Except For “Baby Mama Drama” Reality Gossip TV Spoilers Celeb Moms Music Red Carpet Hot Guys Khloe Kardashian Viggle Points are off at the mo’ Around The Web Like or follow us to continue and get the latest updates for Wetpaint s  It’s only been a few days since the news came out that Khloe Kardashian split with French Montana. Early reports said Khloe was the one to let him go, with French supposedly still hoping the relationship could be saved. However, if French was feeling heartsick he didn’t show it Friday night at Hard Rock Hotel’s Vanity Nightclub. French talked to People while hosting a fight weekend party, and he told the magazine, "I'm feeling great. Feeling great and looking even better."  So his ego is fully intact! French had some fun weekend plans lined up with his friends, but he added to People that, in addition to working on movies and his album, he had to “definitely try to get rid of all these problems I got." What problems? "Baby mama drama and all kind of different [stuff]."  Do you think Khloe made that [stuff] list?  French does have a baby mama in estranged wife Deen Kharbouch, who is not a big fan of her ex. Deen told Life & Style back in April — when Khloe and French were newly dating — that as soon as French started to become successful, he "practically abandoned" his wife and son. She said, at the time, that he did pay her $7,000 a month in child support as they went through their divorce but she said "he was forced to do so" when she went to court. If French is having baby mama drama with Deen, plus work commitments, he may be too busy to try to win Khloe back — if he even really wants to. The Khloe dumped him reports could've just been spin. And some folks say their relationship was just a publicity stunt anyway. However, French may not be completely out of Khloe’s life, since he hired her mother, Kris Jenner, as his manager.

					Thanks for being patient. Sorry!   Meet Marcus Allen’s Baby Mama Lauren Hunter [PHOTOS] You Might Like Lauren Hunter Bio:  Pro Football Hall of Famer Marcus Allen was a legend during his 16-year playing career with the Raiders and Chiefs. If you believe the Nicole Brown Simpson (driftwood) stories, Allen was a legend off the field, too. Somehow during his eventful life, the now 53 year-old Allen never fathered a child …until eight days ago when his girlfriend Lauren Hunter, a fitness model whom he met on MySpace (!), gave birth to Drake Connor Allen. The couple welcomed their newborn son Jan. 5. Because she’s a fitness fanatic, Hunter is already doing push-ups and eating right to get back into her sculpted pre-baby physique. It won’t take long. According to Wiki, Allen is still married to Kathryn Eickstaedt, whom he wed in O.J. Simpson’s backyard in 1993. If that’s true, the holidays were probably a whole lot of fun for Marcus, eh? Of course, Wiki also lists his jersey number as “33,” so who knows. Home: Los Angeles
Age: 28
Stats: 5’8″ 123 lbs. ; 36C-26-36
Children: Three – Drake and two from a previous marriage.
Hobbies: Fitness buff. She constantly talks nutrition and working out. Not sure how Allen feels about all this? Check out this pic. Seems about right. Photos: Instagram.com/laurenashleyhunter and ModelMayhem.com [H/T: TMZ]

All Rights Reserved - iOne Women. All Rights Reserved Powered by WordPress.com VIP 2 years ago So I said I wasn’t going to say anything else about the whole Dwyane Wade baby mama situation, but more details keep popping up so I figured I would update you all. Some of you might remember that Dwyane Wade’s new fiance’, actress Gabrielle Union, received an open letter from one of his potential jumpoffs back in February. Considering Dwyane’s new baby was born on Nov. 10, this letter is said to be written around the time the child was conceived. Messy, messy! Take a look at the letter below (courtesy of “Black Sports Online“): So it’s only right I put Dwyane Wade on blast. First and foremost i’d like to thank ***** Wade, his cousin for booking my numerous of flights.  Ohh yea, hi Ms. Union. Good too see you stuck around and have a few more pieces of clothing inside of his house. The kitchen looks great by the way. I love the new counter tops. I would also like to thank Rich, the chef for his amazing breakfast. His cookies are the best.  And last but not least I’d like to thank Dwayne for always making me feel comfortable on your side of the bed. Hiding pictures in your drawer. You know the night stand next to your side of the bed, the one with the two drawers. Think the picture is the one with you and Sanaa Lathan in it.  Also Gabrielle you are a little to old to be making Valentines day Photo albums. Leave that to the young girls your man cheats on you with. Dont believe me, I took a picture of the picture.  FYI your man likes fat a—s you might need to get you one. Last but not least. I will send you a picture of the bags your man left in the hotel room i f—-d him in. lol  This would sound like a regular scorned groupie if she didn’t have details about their home…and if D. Wade didn’t father a love child nine months later. But Gabby is never one to hold her tongue, so she took to her Twitter to respond. Twitter/Gabrielle Union/Hello Beautiful It could all be a coincidence, but there doesn’t seem to be too much of those in situation.  Copyright © 2016 Interactive One, LLC	.

												 Reality TV became too real for Joe Piscopo when his “assistant” — the mother of his 3 ¹/₂-year-old daughter — punched him in the face while filming ABC’s “Celebrity Wife Swap.” In an episode airing Tuesday, Joe swapped his assistant Jessica Nasoff, who has also been his on-and-off girlfriend for seven years, with the assistant of “Brady Bunch” star Barry Williams, who lives in Branson, Mo. Piscopo, who has a morning drive-time radio show on AM 970 The Answer, “has a propensity for bipolar women,” a friend told me. He divorced his second wife Kimberly Driscoll — an 18-year-old babysitter when he met her — a few years ago. The “Wife Swap” crew filmed Piscopo’s reunion with Jessica when she returned from Branson, but the producer wasn’t satisfied. “Don’t you want to get rid of the chaos in your life?” the producer prodded.  Piscopo sat back down, and said, “Jess, if you had a good time in Branson, if it’s too crazy for you here, why don’t you just spread your wings, and stay in Branson.” A witness said, “She starts crying. Joe goes over to comfort her, and she cold-cocks him right in the jaw. He walked right into it.” Piscopo later told a friend, “Now Martha Stewart is looking good to me. I want an old rich broad.”

Tyrese went to Norma Gibson’s home in North Hollywood Tuesday night to pick up their 6-year-old daughter. Sources say Norma did not want to hand the kid over because she was sick. But before he got there … we’re told Norma called police because she felt the custody order did not require her to turn the kid over and she needed cops to look at the document.  LAPD officers arrived and Tyrese showed up as well. Cops talked to Tyrese and left … and so did Tyrese — without the kid. Law enforcement sources tell us there was no disturbance of the peace … no police report was taken as far as they were concerned it’s case closed. But it’s not case closed for Tyrese. Sources connected to the actor tell TMZ …  he’s going to court to ask a judge to hold Norma in contempt and throw her in jail for violating the custody order. He does not believe his child was sick … he thinks it’s all just revenge. Awww, poor thang, sounds like Tyrese is reading from the book of Saigon.

Featured Stories   It was one of the most talked-about moments during OutKast’s historic, star-studded homecoming shows at Atlanta’s Centennial Olympic. The three late September gigs featured a who’s who of Southern hip-hop royalty and beyond, including members of the influential Goodie Mob; veteran Memphis rhyme duo 8ball & MJG; UGK’s respected orator Bun B; new age Mississippi spitter Big KRIT; critically acclaimed visionary Janelle Monae; Run The Jewels’ mighty Killer Mike; ATL’s current street king Future; and left-field drifter Kid Cudi. But the sold-out crowd during the tandem’s headline-making stand was shocked to witness funk-soul priestess Erykah Badu join ‘Kast’s André 3000 and partner Big Boi on the underrated Stankonia cut “Humble Mumble.” As the charismatic Badu hugged her former significant other Three Stacks she hilariously mused, “That’s my baby daddy!” It was a clear nod to the now legendary union that produced their son Seven. But André tells VIBE that Badu’s jaw-dropping showing was long in the making. “[Badu] knew of the tour already,” said the celebrated MC and budding actor born André Benjamin, who is currently making media rounds to promote his portrayal of guitar god Jimi Hendrix in the independent film Jimi: All is by My Side. “She was supposed to come out to Coachella but the dates did not work out. So we already know that we wanted to find the time to bring out people that we knew during the tour, and I think the Atlanta show worked out.” As for the “baby-daddy” talk, 3000 suggests that people are making too much of a big deal over Badu’s irreverent quip.  “We joke a lot,” André says of his relationship with the unpredictable siren. “People just don’t know our personal life. We joke like that on the phone. She calls me her baby daddy and I call her my baby mama. It’s funny to us now because it’s such a talked-down type term. It is what it is. It’s totally a punch line.” One person that finds the pair’s relationship off-the-wall is Seven.  “Our son is about to be 17 and he tells us, ‘You guys are nuts,’” André laughs. “Erykah and I are cool friends, man. We talk on the phone. She even asks my advice on relationships. She’s like a cool sister more than anything. The first thing people would think about us is, ‘Oh, they don’t get along.’ But there are always feelings when people grow apart. It’s something you have to get through. But man, we are cool.” Stay tuned for VIBE’s full André 3000 Q&A. —Keith Murphy (@murphdogg29) VIBE grabbed some exclusive photos of the fellas.  Free Daily Email

Please upload and apply an image.  I want to tell you a little story. A story about a man who asked me to be his baby-mama. It’s a true story. A story about love, spirit and connection. Once upon a time, in mid-March 2013, I moved to San Francisco for 3 months. A friend of mine had offered me his house in exchange for taking care of his dog while he was away on several business trips, making it a perfect opportunity to explore this beautiful city some more. Said friend has a speculative law firm; taking on high-risk, high-return cases prosecuting insurance companies, corporate organisations, and other big-world baddies, acting as prosecuting attorney for ‘the little people’. Women who had been sexually harassed and worse, men who had serious accidents that went uncompensated, single mothers who were illegally evicted from their rent-controlled homes and so on. This friend – let’s just call him Tom – worked very hard, and very long hours, risking his personal funds to pay for the court hearings of his low-income clients, with the hope that they would end in massive payouts. To say Tom was very stressed is certainly an understatement. His high levels of stress were palpable on every level: his body literally reeked of it; he had trouble sleeping and took sleeping pills every night to aid his rest; he suffered from various skin conditions; was balding prematurely; his friendships and relationships suffered; even his dog was nervous, on edge and frazzled. Having spent his entire life devoted to developing his vocation, here Tom was, 32 years old, with a career that was at the precipice of either taking off or burying him, and absolutely no life balance, no inner peace, no true happiness. He was miserable, and constantly consoling himself with the idea that ‘when this case succeeds / when I have this much money / when I move to this kind of amazing penthouse… Then…yes, then I will be happy’. Tom had never spent any time developing himself either emotionally nor spiritually. Never connected with his own soul or felt what it feels like to truly live. He simply fulfilled the dysfunctional pattern of trying to create a life that appears like success in modern, capitalist America. Because that is, he thought, is what would bring him a fulfilled life. Now that you have a little bit of background, here is where things get interesting. One day Tom came home, when I was there and decided to announce he was in love with me. For me, a laughable fact, since in all his disillusioned life he had never even had a chance to get to know me. Not really. Not the way someone who loves you does. To him, all I was, was a pretty girl, a free-spirit who lived life quite differently to the way he did. And while he was certainly enamoured by my freedom, my ease, my infinite calm and joy, and my view of life, he most definitely was not in love with me. I know love. I know it well. I know what it feels and tastes like. I knew what he felt was not love. What he was perhaps in love with, was the idea of owning something in his life, which gave him an escape from the choices he had made. He saw something in me that his soul craved, that he desperately yearned for, but it was not me. While he was busy crushing his soul with endless court hearings, fighting for people and cases that made him cry, he had lost his own sensitivity, his ability to feel and connect to truth, his Spirit. And instead of seeking that connection within himself, he sought it out in others. In me. I was gentle and clear with him, that his idea of love to me is an illusion. And that perhaps he might like to look within his own soul to find what he is looking for. Because what he seeks is not in me. Tom looked at me with sad, hurt eyes. The next day he went to see his therapist. And came back with some ridiculous book about women rejecting you because they were too fucked-up to see your worth. He showed it to me and said I might like to read it. I laughed and told him to enjoy it. A week later, he confided in me his dream to have a child. He told me that he really wished to become a father, to raise a son and teach him the ways of the world. I could see that what he wished for wasn’t truly a child, but to feel. To feel loved, to feel like he belonged, to feel important, to feel a sense of worth, a feeling of being needed. What he wished and craved for was a sense of connection to the powerful energy that we are all a part of, the feeling of Love the connection with soul and Spirit brings. And then things got weird… Not long after, Tom asked me if I would help him fulfil his dream of having a child, and become his baby’s mama. He offered to support me, my life and our child; in exchange for bearing it and raising the child together as friends. No relationship. No contractual romantic commitment. Just, would I please have his baby. To this day I’m not sure if this request was a very convoluted, complicated way to get me into bed; or to tie me to him, but as you can imagine… That’s just not the way I roll. I told Tom that I believe having a child comes from a union of deep, mutual love and not from a financial contract. I told him that I didn’t believe that he was emotionally and mentally in a place that’s supportive and healthy to having a family, and that perhaps this was a good opportunity to actually dig deep and delve in why he is seeking to fill this hole in his life and soul in such a way. Proclaiming love and seeking to have a child with someone who very clearly doesn’t share any kind of deep feelings and emotions with you, is an act of insecurity and deep inner detachment. Tom was so disconnected from life, love and truth that he couldn’t identify them. Over the next days, as he saw that my mind wouldn’t change, Tom became extremely moody, dark, sharp-tongued and evasive. He wasn’t comfortable with me and what I represented to him: his unwillingness to face his truth. As the air in the house that we shared, became flooded with his animosity and bitterness, I moved out, and onwards. I am forever grateful for this experience as it showed me and taught me how so many people do actually live. I needed to see and experience this, to know the contrast to my own life and choices I make. To understand why I choose the way I choose. Every experience is valuable and there is a reason why life brought the two of us together the way that it did: to learn from each other. Whenever *Tom is in my thoughts I send him love, and hope that one day he jumps into the deep abyss of his soul and finds what he seeks. His own beauty, vulnerability truth and shining light. Beautifully written, sunshine. I LOVE your perspective on life and love xx I love this! I definitely resonated when you said that he was in love with he idea of you. That your freedom and presence was appealing to him, because it was an escape from his regular life- something he is craving.  I think you’ve just summed up the last lot of men in my life Thankyou Vienda!  You did it again girl ;) x It’s so easy for all of us to project what we want or what we think we want onto others. Which is why it’s so important to remain present in every moment as to not fall into the charmed and wicked trappings of our egoic minds… Ah, love! What a conundrum it can be! Haha! xx I’m so very glad I’ve found your site! Love your writing style and energy. This was a beautiful story with so much to take in. Wisdom and love all over. Thank you beautiful Jade. It’s a joy to meet you too! x Beautifully written account of love, seeking love, and a reminder that love can’t be bought. Thank you! Interesting relationship and guy. I hope he has found himself and found someone to love him and support him. I’m glad you took from this a deeper understanding of yourself. What a beautiful, bittersweet story of the human condition and yearning for one of our most basic needs…all in all, we all want to be loved and want something to love. Thank you for sharing, Vienda. xx  Swizz Beatz’s Baby Mama Details Past Affair Leave a Comment #DontShoot Report Bangin Candy Jahna Sebastian, the mother of Swizz Beatz‘s five-year-old daughter Nicole, has granted very few interviews regarding her past with the producer and husband of Alicia Keys. In a recent chat, the London-based singer and Russian immigrant cleared up details regarding her time with Swizz Beatz and claims she had no idea he was married during their time together. In an exclusive interview with our partners, Madame Noire, Sebastian unflinchingly answered questions regarding her past relationship with Swizz Beatz and left little doubt to the extent of their dealings then and now. More from Madame Noire: “I don’t want to be associated with those women who look out for a rich man, a baller or any other successful man to help them have an easy ride in life,” the singer/songwriter told me. “That behavior is totally the opposite of who I am and what I represent, I have always chosen to get what I want through hard work myself, even though there have always been great men around. I have always relied on myself. I work hard for my career and my child. Unlike the way it is now, the single mother explained that her former lover’s personal life was nowhere near as publicized as it now at the time of their relationship. In fact, Jahna says that his personal life was so under the radar in the UK, that she had no idea he was even married. “I was not aware of him being married at the time, I thought he was single like myself and he acted like a single man,” the “I Am Free” singer explained. “He was not that well-known here anyway at that time, his private life was nowhere near as publicized in 2007 as it is now.” Sebastian says she didn’t know Swizz Beatz was still married to Masonda Tifrere, the mother of their son, Kasseeem Dean Jr. She says she kept the existence of Nicole hidden as to not make matters tense for Swizz Beatz and his wife. After some time when she realized it was time to address the situation and allow Swizz Beatz ino their daughter’s life. “We [Mashonda and I] have been in contact for a few years. She did not know that Nicole and I even existed until July 2009 when she and Swizz got the letter with the news at the same time. It was after some time since the divorce had already been filed for other reasons. She is a great mother and a nice person,” said Sebastian. Sebastian isn’t looking for any handouts, and has found success as a music artistand studio owner while embracing her role as a single mother with pride. She has said that Swizz Beatz sees his daughter three to four times a year and that they’re forging a relationship. Read the full story of over at Madame Noire. — Photo: Madame Noire/Jahna Sebastian So…why did Mashonda blame Alicia for breaking up her marriage again? Swizz was doing her dirty long before that. This lady says he even acted like a single man during their relationship in 2007. What a mess.  Guess my first comment wasn’t approved, so I’ll try again.  My question was why would a woman just sleep with a man before knowing him well, or at least well enough to know he was married.  I think some women really don’t care or want to know.  Point blank, asking would be a step in the right direction.  So he didn’t act like he was married.  That really doesn’t mean anything.  Don’t a lot of men act like they’re not married especially in the rap and hip hop world?  He was a producer and she was an artist trying to get a start.  Enough said.   50 Cent’s Baby Mama Alleges He Used To Beat Her Main menu Uh Oh: Sources Say Bobbi Kristina Never Asked Cissy Houston For Her Blessing Yelawolf Posts Pics Of Himself Draped In Confederate Flag [PHOTOS] A-Rod Banned For 162 Games And Will Not Play At All In 2014 Join the Conversation!

However, in this case, he is battling the mother of his teenaged son Shaniqua Tompkins. For some time now, Tompkins has been calling 50 Cent a deadbeat father. She claims he hasn’t seen his son Marquis in two years. This directly conflicts with the image Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson is putting out there because he just had a another child and is constantly posting pictures of the baby on social media. Follow @JaySpeakEasy_ Follow @TheUrbanDaily Well, Tompkins has used her account on social media to blast 50 Cent some more. In her latest rant, she claims the G-Unit leader used to abuse her and their son. She also said the reason he is so angry towards her is because she left him and it brought up all of his hidden abandonment issues. Check out all of the drama taken from Shaniqua Tompkins’ Twitter account below. If you mess up your children, nothing else you do really matters.

Leave a Reply See wayment… Boosie has been hot since he’s been released from prison. The rapper has had beacoup shows and stays in the studio. He plans to release two albums and a whole lot of other positive things are going on, and his baby mama wants a piece.    One of his baby mamas, Walnita Decuir, has penned a tell all book, “When The Music Stops.” If you remember, she smuggled some weed into the prison for him and ended up serving 18 months. It sounds like the typical I held him down but then he left me for someone else. The names are fictional but this is based on a true story, according to information from the book. Peep the excerpt:   What’s crazy is apparently he left her for Deiondra Sanders (daughter of Deion Sander), and Deiondra has been hinting at this for a while now. I swear it seems a bit far fetched but the two are an item or at least were. Homegirl even went to court with Boosie. Check out these photos:       I guess when the reality show didn’t get picked up, she turned to writing books. Chile, I’m done for the day!

Meet Mathew Knowles’ 2nd Baby Mama TaQoya Branscomb (Photos) Main menu Related Articles	 Leave a Comment VIDEO VIEWS Activity Feed on Facebook Featured Bloggers Most Recent Posts Follow “Atlanta Daily World” Also On Atlanta Daily World: Wednesday, February 17 According to multiple media reports, Mathew Knowles was really getting “turnt up” in 2010. That was the year that he impregnated his first baby mama outside of his marriage, Alexsandra Wright, who gave birth to their child, Nixon. It is also apparent that Knowles, 63, also allegedly knocked up Taqoya Branscomb in 2010, a Houston native. 2010 has proven to be a nightmare year for Knowles. It was also the year that his former wife, Tina Knowles, filed for divorce. And it about that time that Beyoncé fired Mathew Knowles as her manager. On top of it all, at 30 years of age, the new baby mama Branscomb is younger than Knowles’ own daughter Beyoncé, which probably doesn’t sit very well with the family. Branscomb is a real estate agent and former model. So, unlike Wright, who didn’t get the child support she desperately needed and had to move into a homeless shelter, Branscomb appears to be a self-sufficient businesswoman and hustler. But that doesn’t mean she doesn’t want Knowles to cut a child support check. In fact, Branscomb went to Harris County courthouse to request a paternity test, get child support and then have Knowles pay for her attorney fees. If Wright could speak to Branscomb right now, she’d probably say “good luck getting those checks.” Take a look at photos of Knowles’ 2nd alleged baby mama Taqoya Branscomb.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11Next page » Tags: Alexsandra Wright » another mathew knowles paternity suit » beyonce » Mathew Knowles » mathews sued by another woman » TaQoya Branscomb » tina knowles Sign up for the Atlanta Daily World Digital Daily!

My name is Amber Fillerup Clark, I am 25 years old and I am married to my best friend, David, where we currently live in New York City with our one year old Atticus and Golden Retriever and soon to be baby girl (due November!) I have always loved all things hair, beauty, fashion, and fitness so that is what this blog is all about! I share with you guys my personal style, hair tutorials for fun styles I come up with, beauty tips, and occasional fitness tips as well! Hope you enjoy and thanks so much for reading!! Oh heavens, yes! I wish this was all real :) I am 5’10” I ALWAYS break my base with a 7N and then use bleach with 30 volume developer for the highlights! For every two highlights I pull one lowlight through with the 7N! If that makes no sense to you, thats okay, just tell all of that to your hair dresser! I am addicted to Estee Lauder Double Wear Foundation! It is so fabulous and lasts all day long and you hardly need any, it goes a long way! I use my beauty blender or Sephora #46 brush to blend it. You can shop all my make up product must haves – here Yes, I have tried a ton of them but Kate Somerville Tanning Towelettes are my favorite!  TEE: Maj Tees c/o // BLAZER: Shopbop (25% off with code INTHEFAMILY14) // MATERNITY JEANS: Nordstrom  HEELS: REISS c/o // SUNGLASSES: Karen Walker // BAG: YSL via Fashionphile // LIPSTICK: MAC ‘Coral Bliss’ WATCH: Michael Kors Photos by Ashlee Brooke Photography I went through an obsession with blazers last year and literally bought one in every color and for a while forgot how much I love them! I went through my closet and re fell in love with blazers – I love throwing them on over a printed tee (obsessed with this baby mama one!) or even just a plain tee and a slick bun. Speaking of baby mama’s… this pregnancy is getting to the point where it is extra hard to dress the bump! I mean there are so few styles that work with a big belly (while not feeling like you look huge haha) and lets be honest some days I just want to be in my sweat pants and a big, comfy tee all day long. I am sure if you are pregnant or have been you know those days when you try on 10 million things and just don’t feel cute in any and end up crying or something and your husband has to try and make you feel better?? Please tell me you can relate haha. I actually love LOVE love dressing the bump 95% of the time BUT there are those days of course  luckily blazers are one thing that I found totally work with the bump and have been a go to lately! Hope you are all having a good week! xox

Where is the baby mama tee from? Thanks! My sister wants one 😉 Hi Amber
I totally know how you feel! (I am 30 weeks at the moment)
I was actually having one of those tearful days when I found your website & it has given me so much inspiration. You look great!
Lisa xxx Aw congrats!!! 30 weeks, you are just right behind me! And girl, I swear every pregnant woman has those days so don’t feel bad! Totally normal! I think its hard when you have the bump to feel good 100% of the time because of all the weight gain but I have never seen a pregnant woman I didn’t think was beautiful so just know its only you who feels that way everyone else thinks you’re a beauty! (easy to say not to hear haha should be saying this to myself too!) xx Girl, I can totally relate to those days and I’m not even pregnant!! It makes me feel better that someone as perfect as you has them too haha. You look gorgeous as always! I’m still a few years (and an upcoming wedding) away from getting pregnant but I’ll definitely have to come back to these posts for some style inspo when I’m carrying my first little one. Who knows, maybe your 2nd or 3rd pregnancy will coincide with my first and I could get maternity style inspiration from your current posts at that time too!  Haha k good I am glad it happens to you too!! And yeah hopefully one of our pregnancies will coincide!!  Thanks for your sweet comment!! xx Aww you amazing prego yes the feeling of, just wanting to lay around,and be comfy but i bet you. Could post some, comfy cloths prego,and still be amazingly gorgoes. Being,a mom is,the best thing,in,the world. Aw thank you! And yes comfy pregnant is the way to be! You seem like such a sweet mama  You look so beautiful – regardless of bump size. 😉 Thanks Dani!! xx You are one chic mama! (To be)

<3, Christina Thank you Christina!! xoxo I can totally relate! Especially the ‘trying on 10 million things and ending up crying part’ lol. I also love dressing the bump 99% of the time, but sometimes…. gosh, I just want to crawl under covers and stay there all day! Haha right?!?! I mean seriously the mix of emotions, weight gain, and a million things not fitting sometimes is just too much haha  glad you can relate! xx Those jeans are amazing! My best friend is prego right now and I am going to have to get her that shirt! http://www.loveandclothing.com Oh you totally should!!  Ha I still have those days all the time now! But YESSSSS! I know exactly what you mean. I actually did wear tee-shirts basically the entire time I was pregnant. You always look so incredibly cute, and I’m sure you still would even if you wore sweats, so don’t worry 😉 If it makes you feel better, I looked sorta like a  baby whale with acne. It was terrible.  Worth it, obviously ’cause little boys are the best!! (Also I think it’s great you’re my age, married, and going to have a baby. I kinda feel like the odd man out sometimes, so it’s nice to be reminded that I’m not the only one!).  Anyways, sorry for the really long and sorta creepy, personal comment. I hope it made you feel at least a little better!    :*  Otherwise, I’m soooo sorry haha!  Christina Yes tee’s are so nice during pregnancy! I am all about comfort these days!! And yeah so worth it! So fun that you have a little boy too, how old is he? xoxo He’s two now! Crazy huh? I still feel like a baby myself (maybe because I’m still in school!) It’s goes by so incredibly fast!! I feel like I was just where you are yesterday and now Carsten counts to ten and says things like  “Hi, mommy. I love you.” I’m so excited for you!  Aw so fun!! He sounds darling!! That makes me so excited for a boy!  So wish I had seen this tee when I was pregnant with my girls! You look Gorgeous Amber!  Each time I was pregnant I too would cry a lot and was just super emotional, that is so normal girlie! But, it is just so worth it all to have our lil babies…. I hope these last weeks of your pregnancy will be a breeze! XO Aw thanks!! And I know right these pregnancy hormones are insane! But yes so so worth it! You are the sweetest thing and an amazing mama I am sure! xx You really really look greaaaat in everything! But it’s normal to have those days, I have them too and Im not even pregnant!  Amazing heels! And t-shirt is lovely. http://weareatlove.com

Best wishes from England Oh gosh thanks girl!! xoxo Unfortunately, it does get difficult to look cute towards the end of a pregnancy. My last weeks were awful, bloated mess.  But you kinda get to the point (this is the last couple weeks) where you don’t care…just want the baby out!! But, you’ve got a ways to go! Hang in there!

I really hope it’s not true and something tells me Omarion’s mama is behind all this . via: BlackMediaScoop Omarion and his Love & Hip Hop star girlfriend Apryl have reportedly split and it’s all because Apryl refused to give her son a DNA test to prove he’s Omarion’s. Word on the street is Apryl and Omarion seem to have a very good relationship – but Omarion’s mom has been starting some drama. According to sources, Omarion’s mom has been hinting around that the baby looks bi-racial. She also mentioned that Apryl’s ex boyfriend is Mexican. If this aint some juicy mess! That baby does look Mexican…just sayin’ lol! So a source claims that after months of mama spitting that HATE into Omarion’s ear, he started having second thoughts about paternity. The source says “Omarion asked for a DNA test, and Apryl was offended . . . she started crying and carrying on.” The insider continued, “After Apryl calmed down Omarion asked again and she still said no.” Blac Chyna Puts Tyga On BLAST After Break Up!    So the source claims Omarion ended up dumping Apryl! Oh and did we mention that all of this was caught on camera and will be shown later this season on Love And Hip Hop Hollywood!     Copyright © 2016 Interactive One, LLC	.

You'll Love   Mel Gibson has more than $450 million in his coffers, but his ex only has $10 in her pockets. The woman at the center of Gibson’s epic audio rants and bitter custody battle, Oksana Grigorieva, has filed bankruptcy, according to docs obtained by CB!  Grigorieva filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy last month citing $48K in assets, but she owes more than $438,000. The Russian beauty was thrust into the limelight when it was revealed she and the former $900 million man were having an affair and later a love child, 4-year-old Lucia, which broke up his 31-year marriage. Then, who can forget those explosive audio recordings that led to a criminal investigation of the 58-year-old when he made death threats and told the singer “you deserved it” after she said he hit her and broke her teeth. It also exposed Gibson’s priceless breathless quotes like “I deserve to be blown first! Before the f*cking Jacuzzi! Ok, I’ll burn the goddamn house up, but blow me first!.” And what’s become all too familiar territory for Gibson, including slurs against Hispanics and the N-word. Grigorieva’s recent money woes include only $7,500 in child support funds (BTW, Gibson pays her $2,500 a month), $300 in her bank account, $8,000 in furniture, her very own artwork worth a mere $500, a $5,000 piano, $2,000 in clothing, $1,500 in jewelry, and a modest $15,000 Dodge Charger. Most of her outstanding financial obligations are credit card debts, including a whopping $200,000 in legal and court fees no doubt when it came to battling her famous ex in front of the judge.

The father of Teen Mom 2 star Chelsea Houska’s daughter Aubree, 4 — who just split from Taylor Halbur, the mother of his 9-month-old daughter, Paislee, in late April — has jumped into a serious relationship with fellow Sioux Falls, South Dakota, native Jessica Nicole.

												 NBA star Paul George, in a “gross insult” to women, has branded the mother of his baby girl an unfit parent — because she’s a full-time mom, a Manhattan matrimonial lawyer charged on Friday. “She’s unemployed because she has a 2-month-old child,” lawyer Raoul Felder said of his client, Daniela Rajic, outside Manhattan Supreme Court. “This is grossly insulting to women.” The Indiana Pacers forward has claimed in his custody suit that awarding shared custody would be “detrimental” to the child, the Indiana Pacers forward claims in his custody suit because Rajic has “refused to seek or gain employment and is dependent upon others for the care of her child.” Rajic has been living with family in Middle Village, Queens, since giving birth to baby Olivia on May 1. The ex-stripper dressed demurely for her court appearance Friday in a white button-down shirt and black pants. But the hearing was adjourned until a federal judge decides whether the matter should be held in Florida, where George filed the custody suit, or New York, where she has filed her own. Felder called George’s case for custody of Olivia especially “absurd” because the big-bucks dad is asking Rajic — who has no assets — for child support. George has a five-year, $95 million contract with the Pacers. The hoops star has never met the child, sent a gift or paid her a dime in support, Rajic told The Post. George says that if the court awards Rajic custody, he wants to pay less than state guidelines, according to court papers. George filed his suit in Miami last week. Rajic was just served with the papers, almost a month after she sued him in Manhattan for sole custody and support. In her suit, Rajic argues that George is the unfit parent because he is constantly on the road.
Rajic brightened Friday when talking about her daughter. “She is an angel, a perfect baby,” the buxom brunette told The Post. “Only recently he’s had an interest in seeing the child,” Felder said, adding that the timing coincides with the filing of the suits. A spokesman for George insisted there be a paternity test. “As we have said repeatedly, If there is a paternity test that is legally binding, Mr. George will embrace his responsibilities as a father and provide emotional and financial support to the child,” the rep said in a statement. In his Florida custody petition, George admits to meeting the former Tootsie’s cabaret dancer in Miami and being in a sexual relationship with her from June to August but says he wants “reputable, scientific testing” to prove he is the father.

A Recent History of Sports Baby Mama Drama Michael Turner Channels Our Sites A Recent History of Sports Baby Mama Drama NowTrending NowTrending Baby Mamas: Maria Grissom, Rasheeda Walker, and allegedly many moreMichael Turner's alleged fifth baby mama, Maria Grissom, launched a "get to know your baby" Twitter campaign with a picture of their daughter and a not so subtle caption of "Michael Turner daughter, my sweetie... Let's pray he decide to see her one day this year." Besides being called out in 160 characters or less, Turner made headlines last year for reportedly breaking up a girl-on-girl fight at his home between a golf club wielding Elizabeth Delacruz (his then-girlfriend) and Rasheeda Walker (one of his five baby mamas).  The Baby Mama Syndrome What is The Baby Mama Syndrome? Can we simplify that definition? OK, so that’s not very simple.  Try again. Get the Book Circumstances People  Relationships Behaviors Negative effects Comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Recent Posts About Robert Doyel Sign-Up for Email Updates About Judge Doyel Connect with Me Categories Looking for Something? Judge Doyel July 22, 2014 by Robert Doyel 6 Comments  Baby mamas are unwed mothers of any age.  The fathers of their children are baby daddies.  “Baby mama drama” has become a common expression for the many conflicts associated with baby mamas.  Less well known is “baby daddy trauma,” which refers mostly to domestic or other violence committed by a baby daddy.  “Drama” and “trauma” don’t begin to describe all the issues included in the Baby Mama Syndrome. Dictionary definitions of syndrome often describe “a constellation of” symptoms, things, events etc. related to a certain condition.  A syndrome is also defined as “a predictable pattern” of circumstances, behaviors, events etc. associated with a particular social condition.  Unwed pregnancies and births are the social condition we’re dealing with here. I define the Baby Mama Syndrome as the constellation of circumstances, people, relationships, behaviors, and negative effects related in any way to two people making a baby together when they are not married to each other.  It is not a medical or psychological diagnosis, although some of the negative effects on individual baby daddies and especially on baby mamas and their children can be both psychological and medical. I’ll try.  The Baby Mama Syndrome starts with two people who are not married to each other conceiving a child together. The Baby Mama Syndrome involves the baby mama, the baby daddy, their biological relatives and in-laws, as well as other baby mamas and baby daddies with “ties” to the baby mama or baby daddy, plus friends, the police, the court system, society, taxpayers, and, of course, the child. The Syndrome includes any behavior by any of those people or institutions that would not have happened if the baby had never been conceived.  It can also include living arrangements, employment, and lifestyle.  In fact, it includes just about anything related to the two unmarried parents. We all suffer from the Baby Mama Syndrome.  The number of illegitimate births in our country every year is huge, and this phenomenon has changed our culture forever, with lasting negative effects on individuals (especially the children), governments, and society. We start with two people who are not married to each other having sex resulting in the female getting pregnant.  Well, that’s not really the start.  Let’s look at the five components of my definition of the Baby Mama Syndrome, starting with “circumstances.” Celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Halle Berry, and Dwight Howard make unwed pregnancies look like no big deal.  But celebrities often have lots of money to help solve their problems, although their wealth isn’t always enough. Most baby mamas and baby daddies are poor, can’t afford health care for themselves or their children, and have trouble putting food on the table.  Many have to live with parents or grandparents.  A large proportion of them didn’t intend to make a baby at all. They may be in committed relationships, just dating, or hooking up the night they meet.  They may be married to someone else and make a baby while having an extramarital affair. Baby mamas may be children themselves or in their forties, and baby daddies can be any age from puberty on up.  A quarter of a million teen-agers became baby mamas last year, some of them for the second, third, and even fourth times. Baby mamas and baby daddies can be any race, ethnic group, or religion. A shocking array of people may be brought into the troubles of baby mamas and their baby daddies.  The baby mama many times is in conflict with some other woman who is seeing the baby daddy or has a child with him.  The other woman is her “romantic rival,” according to academic experts. Friends, neighbors, the older children of one of the parents, relatives, even strangers can get caught up in the problems.  The police are called, a judge puts one or both parents in jail or on probation, court staff and child support enforcement personnel have to deal with them, and social workers such as child protective investigators are brought in. And, obviously, there is always at least one baby.  These people and the agencies they work for may be part of a particular Syndrome, but all of them are part of the Syndrome we as a society and as taxpayers suffer from. One of the biggest problems in the Baby Mama Syndrome is that relationships between baby mamas and baby daddies are often fleeting and unstable, and new boyfriends and girlfriends move in and out of the homes to the detriment of the kids. Besides the intimate partner relationship between the two unmarried parents, “relationships” in the Baby Mama Syndrome include any connection any person or agency may have with the baby mama or baby daddy.  Romantic rivals, friends, grandparents, strangers, hookups, neighbors, the parents’ other children, current and ex-spouses, live-in boyfriends and girlfriends, fellow workers and bosses, anyone connected in any way with either the baby mama or baby daddy can get caught up in their drama. As time goes on I will introduce you to the wild and often bizarre behaviors of some baby mamas and baby daddies and the others brought into the drama.  One woman stalking another is commonplace, especially by phone or on social media like Facebook.  Domestic violence occurs frequently.  The children may be abused emotionally, physically, or sexually. Some parents have little interest in raising children; others can’t or won’t support the kids.  Baby mamas account for 85% of abortions each year in this country.  Some baby mamas or baby daddies drink excessively or abuse drugs, and their behavior can lead to abuse, abandonment, or neglect of their children. If you’ve read this far, you get the idea.  I have written and will write many thousands of words spelling out in detail the negative effects of the Baby Mama Syndrome.   Those effects are the unfortunate fallout from a culture that no longer values marriage as a necessary step before making babies, and of several years in which 40% of all babies born in this country have had mothers who were not married and probably didn’t want the babies in the first place.

Julie Lucas says  March 10, 2015 at 6:02 pm I just became aware of this book ,I ABSOLUTELY WILL BE PURCHASING ,THIS BOOK BOTH electronically ,and Hard Copy,if both are offered ! I am a “mother” of a human being that has been going through this from the second he was born. The father,and I are “POSTER CHILD” examples! I am the non custodial parent who has a past of HERION addictin,felony arrest,not going any further than high school (and I still wonder how I even did that! ) and most important a person who has for the past fourteen years disrupted this child’s growth ,and need of a BIOLOGICAL MOTHER not a woman who just had a baby, So this is the place I’ll often visit and be a part of (the book ,website,any a any other means of EDUCATION, involving this subject. I want to thank this judge for making this  literature available,this willbeen the ONE source of truth,on every level,emotional social,personal,spiritual,legal and any other facet that involves this HORRIBLE SYNDROME 
Robert Doyel says  March 10, 2015 at 8:15 pm Thank you for your soul-baring post.  I hope my writing will be as educational and as useful as you think.  My second book on Baby Mama Syndrome Violence is in the rewrite stage and I hope to have it published by early summer.  The third one, though, should be right on the mark for you.  Children of the Baby Mama Syndrome is about half written.  It will focus on bad things that happen to the kids and on manipulation by parents, including abuse of the court system. The first book is available now in hardback and paperback online at Amazon and Barnes & Noble.  Ebooks are available for Kindle, Nook, and iPhones, iPads etc at Amazon, B&N, and iTunes.  I still have a supply of hardbacks which I can autograph if you prefer that.  If you want one from me, email me at robertdoyel@judgedoyel.com.  We will have to figure out how I can get it to you. 
Trish says  March 13, 2015 at 2:44 pm I totally agree with that you were saying about baby mama syndrome!  As an educator in a preschool, I see baby mamas all the time.  At one time, I had 10 children in my class, 8 whose parents were not married.  Some were living in the abuse shelter.  There were court orders against some baby daddies.  The children had very little food in their lunches, and what was there was unhealthy, processed food.  The children would act out inappropriately, which made us wonder what they were seeing at home.  The children whose parents were married seemed happier and less aggressive in the classroom.  Thank  you for the article! 
Robert Doyel says  March 13, 2015 at 3:00 pm I am learning as I go along that educators and nurses are more in a position to know about The Baby Mama Syndrome than most people.  I appreciate your affirmation.  I hope you looked at the rest of my website and saw that I’ve written a book that contains a whole lot more information than the one blog post. 
Maria says  July 20, 2015 at 6:00 am I’m a “baby momma” statistic but I wasn’t a drug addict nor had any domestic violence or anyrhing like that. My case was purely that I was extremely naive and uneducated when I began to have a sexual relationship. I think your upbringing has much to do with it as my parents were extremely conservative and I wasn’t even allowed to date until I was 18 not to mention we never had any sex ed. conversations. Sex was taboo and not an openly discussed topic. Needless to say that I fell head over heels for a guy and thought he was “the one”. I have a step father who has other children with an ex wife so when I met who I thought was Mr.Right….little did I know he was actually Mr. Wrong!! He had 2 children already with a baby mamma and I had never experienced drama like that! I was young and so in love and thought I could “fix it”.  I always knew that marriage was important and I practically begged him for us to get married, but that didn’t happen.  I hung on for a little while longer dealing with the baby mama drama until I found myself in the same predicament and became pregnant at 20 and held on 2 more years until I got pregnant again and then I made a decision to leave becuase I couldn’t live like that any longer. I became a baby mama and have worked very hard to provide stability and a “drama free” household for my 2 children. Their father pays child support but does not exercise any visitation rights and I have never forced my children on him. The father is back with first baby mama and I think they are still not married (10 yrs later)I only contact him for urgent matters like the kids needing a passaport and legal matters like that. I’m a baby mama/single mother and my bad decision has cost me many years of struggles, but thankfully we are not on welfare and I work very hard to educate them and try to give them the tools they need to make wiser decisions than the ones I made. I am sadly a baby mama but gladly without the drama. 
Robert Doyel says  July 20, 2015 at 7:48 pm Maria, you are a brave woman for putting your story online for all to see. You describe issues in your life that I have seen in hundreds and hundreds of court cases. The difference between many of those cases and your situation is you. You may not have been mature and obviously weren’t equipped by your parents or schools to deal with the issues you confronted, but you are handling it all responsibly and with wisdom. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment  Name *  Email *  Website

Here we go again.  Last week Nas’ daughter’s mother Carmen Bryan was reportedly trying to have him jailed for contempt of court for failing to pay $11K in back child support/tuition for their daughter Destiny. Now in a weekend interview with the Hip-Hop Socialite she reveals she doesn’t want to see him behind bars, she just wants him to get help for his “mental health issues.” Yikes…  Peep the excerpts below: On Media Reports That She Wants Nas To Be Jailed: “I do not want to see my child’s father go to jail. However, I do want to see him get the mental help that I believe he desperately needs. So this situation is a curse and a blessing with regard to the fact that there are some deep-rooted mental issues that I believe exist and need to be addressed.” On Her Beliefs About Nas’ Mental Health Issues: “Well first off, let me just say my experiences with Nas, my dealings with Nas, and my research all lead me to believe that he does suffer from bipolarism and he may be a paranoid schizophrenic.   That’s my personal opinion based on my experiences and interaction with him.  An incident occurred with Nas years ago when we were together. I came in the house, Destiny and I, and he was on the couch wrapped up in a blanket; his mom was on one side of him, his brother on the other side, there were a few more people in the house. My first reaction was, ‘Is everything okay? What happened?’ And that’s when Nas told me ghosts were haunting him again, and entities were whispering to him and touching him and bothering him.  This is something that he mentioned when we first got together, but I had never experienced him ever experiencing it until that moment. So, I’ve witnessed this long battle with insanity.” Whoa. Do you believe her? With all the stuff that she revealed when her book came out — why no mention of mental health issues before in her dealings with the press? Nas’ mother died before he married Kelis, so why not mention this incident before?  Hit the flip for Carmen’s explanation for why she decided to take the issue over Destiny’s tuition to court and what she claims Kelis had to say about his alleged mental health issues.

We’ve seen makeups, breakups, shade, and twitter feuds as our favorite celebrities try to navigate the the ins and outs of their non-traditional family situations. Here are 15 kinds of celebrity baby drama making headlines these days. Image Source: Instagram.com We’re glad that Ciara is taking the high road and getting along with all three of Future’s baby mama’s, but this Instagram publicity shot of the whole team feels…awkward. Does anyone smell a reality show in the mix? I’m sorry… Chris Bosh is on the road 10 months out of the year… how he could win custody is weird to me…. these courts need to change how much these chicks get in CS and watch all the babies stop popping up… these chicks use these babies as their golden tickets. I don’t like that term baby mama either! As long as “less than smart” women continue having kids with guys who
they think have money and will take care of them, they will more than
likely continue to become baby mamas, and as long as “less than smart”
women continue getting with guys who have multiple kids with multiple
women, there will more than likely be baby mama drama. The Secret- Jamie Foxx; that ‘s NO way to date; if she’s good enough for you to get all up in between and plant your seed then she should be good enough for you to escort out in public.  There is more to this because it doesn’t make sense; Chris Bosh- #LOSER!!!!  He’d rather take custody of their daughter from his college girlfriend then pay the proper amount of child support.  Also, if the girl is a CLOSE friend of mine and I knew her man was steppin out then I would tell her but if its someone that I’m not that close to, I’ll let her find out on her own.  Not trying to see anyone get dogged out but you know how females are; they are so in love with the man that if you try to be a friend and pull her coat tails to the situation you end up being a hater and jealous and wanting their man.  Ain’t nobody got time for that!!! Chris Bosh is a jerk As long as “less than smart” women continue having kids with guys who they think have money and will take care of them, they will more than likely continue to become baby mamas, and as long as “less than smart” women continue getting with guys who have multiple kids with multiple women, there will more than likely be baby mama drama. Jamie, Jamie, Jamie at some point one of your baby mamas will go public.  Go ahead and make a stupid move to make one of them mad.  They will get paid if they are not already. These cases I don’t even feel sorry for.   Some of these men and women need to sit down and stop producing children. I think jamie foxx is weird just like his weird azz hairline HAHA, I am so glad I wasn’t the only one who got side tracked by the hair line. lol it’s like dude…just let it go…it’s gone…GONE! I’m so glad I’m not the only one.  I’m tired of these dudes and their spray on hairlines…you to Brian White. wtf is up with jamie hair line Jaime went ‘Hollywood’ a few years ago.  I like people so much better in the beginning but he went and got his mouth fixed and it looks like he’s had other work done.  Don’t get me wrong, if you need 8 root canals and don’t want to spend the extra money for 8 crowns then by all means do your thing but he went an got caps put on his teeth. UGH! this is why the bible put so much emphasis on marriage before kids. this is EXACTLY WHY! There are reasons for things being called “the right way” Amen!  These people just don’t have any morale’s or values.  Just go to bed with any man or women without a thought then you want to complain about support.  These people are so stupid! you know not EVERYONE believes in your bible right? i didn’t say that anybody had to. the bible is really just a guide to a good life. most of the things in it are common sense. if you get married and stay committed to each other, you won’t have any baby mama drama. it’s simple You date people who are just like you, so if you’re in to foolishness and drama, you’re going to date people who bring right along with them. See TO, Rihanna,and Ocho Cinco past histories for example. MadameNoire is a sophisticated lifestyle publication that gives African-American women the latest in fashion trends, black entertainment news, parenting tips and beauty secrets that are specifically for black women. Black women seek information on a wide variety of topics including African-American hair care, health issues, relationship advice and career trends - and MadameNoire provides all of that.

Dwyane Wade’s Baby Mama Aja Denies He Neglects Their Son Hollyweird actress Gabrielle Union recently opened up about her leaked pics that hit online less then a month ago with Cosmo Magazine but that’s not the only thing that has the internet going nuts. Gabby conveniently forgot to mention Wade’s break baby in the article, leading people to think she doesn’t care about Wade’s other son… My honeymoon was plagued by thoughts of when I would get hit. It was always in the back of my mind: Will today be the day my life gets ruined? I thought about my family and everyone the scandal would affect — my mom, who teaches classes about Catholicism to kids, and the three boys I had become a stepmother to when I married Dwyane.
