The best way to explain the unexplainable… Like Liquid! Damn I love that terminology. I need to get that tattooed on me.

Nas' Baby Mama Tells All...
 Click play to watch a video of Carmen Bryan (the mother of Nas'daughter Destiny)in an interview talking about her upcoming tell-all book. In her book, "It's No Secret", she does a Superhead and gives detailed stories of her various sexcapades with celebrities such as Nas, Jay-Z and Allen Iverson. Click the link below the video to read a chapter from her book over at "Crunk & Disorderly". I have my fingers crossed that Oprah won't fall for this chick's nonsense (like she did with Superhead) and invite her on the show. I wonder if these women even think about how these tell-all books will affect their children. I'm sure Nas and Carmen's daughter is old enough to know what's going on. Children aren't as naive as we think they are. Click Here to Read a Chapter from Her Book at C&D

Each part of this baby blanket is made in a lace design from a different country.  This is all sport weight soft baby yarn.  The border was all sewn continuous on a very long round knitting needle.  I give that credit to my Boye modular knitting needle set.  This is an English lace pattern.  All the salmon and green stripes are made in an Italian lace pattern.  This is a Spanish lace pattern.  This is a French lace pattern.  This is a colonial American lace pattern that forms the edging. 
 
Afghans, Baby

 Yes, I’m opening up old….something.
Anyways, I’ve spent the morning looking for a pattern or instructions for spanish lace, and I think this is the best result I have found. From my mother’s description, I think your pattern matches what we have been looking for. Do you know where I can find instructions for this particular stitch? It is from A Treasury of Knitting Patterns by Barbara G. Walker and published by Schoolhouse Press.  There is also a Second and Third volume in the series and all are excellent resources for knitting stitches. I’d like to ask where you got the american lace pattern because I absolutely love yours. That one is from A Second Treasury of Knitting Patterns by Barbara G. Walker, Corona, Chapter 11 Eyelets, pg 250 and the english lace as well if you don’t mind me asking. That one is from A Treasury of Knitting Patterns by Barbara G. Walker, Fern or Leaf-Patterned Lace, Chapter 10 Lace, pg 208

According to the Miami Herald, Daniel’s attorney Jason Setchen recently filed court documents naming Storch as the child’s father and requesting custody and child support. Daniel gave birth to Jalen Scott Storch, now 4 months old, on April 16. In her financial affidavit, the 29-year-old woman says she is unemployed, has no funds in the bank and lists her only assets as an ’03 Pontiac Grand Am and an ’04 Chevrolet Monte Carlo with a combined value of $21,000. Since Storch failed to respond to Daniel’s paternity suit Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Marc Schumacher issued a default judgment declaring Storch the “legal, natural, and biological father.” Schumacher will decide child support, attorney’s fees and other issues at a later date. While Storch’s failure to respond has reflected poorly on the multimillionaire producer, he claims he was out of the country in St. Tropez and “missed a court date,” but is now working to resolve the matter. “I would never, ever be a deadbeat dad,” Storch told the Miami Herald.  -article courtesy of SOHH.Com

 The Carmen Bryan Files: Did Jay-Z Give Nas Baby Mama a STD?  MrsQ
Just me   Member since 6/06 11378 total posts Name:Qiana The Carmen Bryan Files: Did Jay-Z Give Nas Baby Mama a STD?  Carmen Bryan was on Gossip Wendy William's show discussing being passed around between Nas, Jay-Z, and Allen Iverson. One thing that popped up was she confirmed that she got a STD (chlamydia) from either Nas or Jay-Z and Nas adamantly denied it. Carmen sounds like she believes Nas. Also Carmen confirms she was pregnant with Jay-Z's baby. Wendy William's probably covered most of Carmen's book in the extensive interview. Carmen says basketball star Allen Iverson is a better lover than Jay-Z but Jay-Z is packing more than Nas. Oddly, Carmen comes across as intelligent and makes some good points.Here are the audio clips of the interview:Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4  Diva
I am what I am  Member since 12/05 2825 total posts Name:Jennifer Re: The Carmen Bryan Files: Did Jay-Z Give Nas Baby Mama a STD?  I was inquiring about this yesterday.  Although I heard the majority of Carmen's interview (who obviously makes a living off being a ho), I was curious to know if Nas called into the show.What really burned me about this interview was the fact that she claimed she wouldnt discuss her daughter because she was trying to protect her, yet what kind of example is she teaching her by glorifying this lifestyle?    sweetie

Everyone's had a ride and she could have easily gotten from someone else. She's just looking to sell more books and figures this juicy tidbit will get more people to buy.   sweetie

 The Fight for a Man's RightsDid you know that if you don't show up to paternity court, you could be named some child's father by default? According to some shit I just read at XXL, that's just what happened to "Lean Back" producer Scott Storch recently. A Miami woman name Dalene “Dae” Jennifer Daniel has filed a paternity suit against the highly sought after beatmaker which cites him as the father of her infant son Jalen Scott Storch. Daniel claims that she is currently unemployed and her only assets are two cars valued at $21,000.Since Storch chose not to respond to the suit, a Miami judge declared Storch the “legal, natural, and biological father” by default. Child support and other financial issues will be determined at a later date. Does this mean that a broad can just name her baby Lemonjelo Byron Crawford and all of a sudden it's mine just because I was too busy to make it to court that day? If so, that's just wrong. Also, how did this broad get two cars worth $21,000 if she's "currently unemployed." To give you an idea, you'd need literally 17.5 of my cars to equal that value, and I work all the time. Fortunately, I'm getting a new car later this week that's going to put me square in the $6,000 range. Another thought: How do you think Scott Storch's momma or, god forbid, his real girlfriend is going to feel knowing he dropped it off in a broad named Dalene "Dae" Daniel? A woman shouldn't just be allowed to destroy a man's life like this. Click here to subscribe to my new weekly email newsletter Life in a Shanty Town

        Ten years ago I was in a relationship with a woman I considered myself to be in love with. I asked her to marry me and while we were engaged she got pregnant. Now let me preference this by saying that she had one child when we met as did I. I had explicitly explained to her that we could not afford another child at that time and that we needed to pool our money together to get our own place as she was living with her parents at the time. Well I learned that she was not the one for me and broke off the engagement. Shortly thereafter when my son was born I decided that maybe we could make it work as I didn't want to have another child out of wedlock. So we got engaged a second time but still we couldn't make it work so I moved on. Years later after I had found someone new she decided that she wanted to get back together but at that point it was too late. When she found out I was getting married - my child is now five - she went to the courts to file child support. Even though I was giving her money and trying to see my son when she wasn't being difficult. Now we are going back and forth in child support court because they are trying to make me pay more than I can afford. I make my payments on time google_ad_client="pub-2041108528225718";google_ad_width=250;google_ad_height=250;google_ad_format="250x250_as";google_ad_type="text";google_ad_channel="";google_color_border="FFFFFF";google_color_bg="FFFFFF";google_color_link="000099";google_color_url="CCCCCC";google_color_text="000000";and they still garnished my wages and suspended my license without my knowledge. I drive for a living, if I had gotten arrested for a suspended license I would have lost my job and no one would have gotten child support. But still I have to pay for the incompetence of our child support system but yet I get no visitation with my son. She is contesting legitimation because she doesn't want me to have any rights. I feel that the law should state unless a woman is willing to not contest to legitimation and visitation that she deserves no child support. So now I am paying a woman that purposely quit her job so that I can support her and her three children which only one is mine. But I don't get to help raise my son and he wonders why his daddy won't come and see him. The laws are crazy. They are not in the best interest of the child. I think us non-custodial parents should ban together and change the laws. Whose with me?Trey's Thoughts: When trying to work things out with a woman who does not want to be with you can be hurtful and hard, especially if you both have a child together. I was very young when I had my son and did not know the system as well as I do now. Learning how the child support system works can work to your advantage if you know what to look for.

Tom Cruise Biography Tom Cruise Tom Cruise Photos Tom Cruise Quotes Tom Cruise Videos Over the weekend, we saw actor Tom Cruise and his baby's mama, Katie Holmes, taking in a soccer match featuring his daughter, Isabella. Last night, Tom and his son, Connor, took in the Washington Redskins' opener in Landover, Md., along with Holmes. It was a bit of business and pleasure, as Cruise, who was recently given the pink slip by Paramount, recently signed a deal with 'Skins owner Daniel Snyder, who will finance his production company. Here's TomKat and Connor, photographed on the sidelines last night:  Despite all the hullabaloo over the recently-revealed Suri Cruise, Tom is showing that he's still a huge part of his other two children's life. Both Connor and Isabella were adopted by Tom and ex-wife Nicole Kidman. We applaud his efforts as a good family man. So why don't you just step off, Moby! N-n-n-nobody listens to techno! While T.H. Gossip has taken plenty of shots at Cruise's insanity, we've never been accused of failing to give props when and where they are due. Some of our staff members have been accused of petit larceny, driving without insurance, disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace and urinating in public, but that's neither here nor there.  I was feeling pressed in the interview with Matt Lauer. For me, my issue was really about child drugging. It's not like it is today, like people are really kind of openly talking about this.  I can't even articulate it, to be honest. That feeling, that connection. Just who she is and what she means to me. Submissions? Questions? Looking to advertise?

According the NY Daily News, Artest is fighting in family court for full custody of his youngest son Jeron.  Sources say this comes after his former girlfriend, Jennifer Palma, refused sex with him even though he is married with three children.

I admit that I slept on Ms.DASH as B.M. status.  Yeah, I wanted to beat her little seat, but I didn’t want to bust up in it.  After I saw these photos I realized that I need to get one of her eggs.  I know cloning is immoral and the whole nine, but what if you could go to the supermarket and get a carton of STACY DASH eggs?  I would put those in a cup and drink them. [Editor’s note:  if you can’t open the above link you will need to get a password from BLU CHEEZ] I feel a little fucked up about going to the newsstand and buying this magazine since I too want Black women to be portrayed by the media in the proper light.  Speaking of light(ing), the scenes that Playboy is using are wonderfully lit and they really show Ms.DASH’s marvelous 40year old physique.  Fuck what your heard, STACEY has made 40 the new 20 and I want to pummel fire out of her cocoa tanned backside.  I want to beat her little pum pum up like she said something bad about my momma’s cooking.  I want to see if I can leave my handprint on her firm, oil-sheened azz. Getting back to the whole media image thing…  I think it’s a powerful feminist statement that STACEY DASH is making by posing in Playboy.  She is taking control of her image by not letting it be exploited by lesser publications like Maxim, Blender or Black Tail.  Playboy is not pimping STACEY DASH, she is pimping Playboy. Who am I kidding?  The STACEY DASH Playboy mag is a collector’s item along with the VANESSA WILLIAMS Penthouse and the JAYNE KENNEDY Playboy. STACEY DASH is the ultimate hustler.

 I can’t hate. She looks good. (My husband agrees 100%). I’m a fan ever since clueless. She’s been in the entertainment business for quite a while so my question is . . . why now? What does she expect to accomplish and what is she trying to say? She she hard up for money or for attention? I don’t buy all that Playboy is classy and Maxim, KING, FHM, Stuff, etc. is low-grade. She posed nude, she’s no different from any of the other ladies on-line paying their bills. Note, most of the girls pose so they can get into acting, not necessarily the other way around. At the end of the day, I’m not mad, I will get the magazine. SHE IS SUPER-FINE! I’m still into Toccara posing for KING. Homegirl looks damn good to have had two kids. Playboy has always been the “classier” of men’s magazines as that arena goes. And I am sure she got a lot more  from Playboy than she would have gotten from Maxim and King. She doesn’t need to do it for the money more than like but if your gonna do it might as well get paid for it I guess.  Hmmm wonder what Dame had to say bout that??? The things I would do her… […] Stacy Dash: My 2007 Baby Mama DallasPenn.com was created for events like the Stacey Dash Playboy spread. […] I would like to add that Stacy Dash does not look fine enough to take her clothes off. She should keep them on. ^earl = teh ghey i think shes the finest 40 year old ive ever seen She Looks O MAZING. Hope I Look That Good At 40. She Turned Me On. O My God. D tell stacy to get at me PLEASE she is all that Earl, you must be drinking the koolaid ´cause even with 3 kids and a husband I can see she is all that!   Somebody needs to tell Janet how good genes REALLY work. (ducking from the legions of defenders!) (*sidebar* I “seen” her joints before but am I missing anyother gouda or port wine in that category that I need a PW?) G, when I get back home I will have BLU CHEEZ hit you with a DP dot com username and p.w. this way you can view the inter-racial love pix without Rafi getting his speed o’s all up in a bunch. SHE IS FINE AS FUCK HATTERS…… Stacey is the most beautifulliest woman in the world. And If I had 24 hours to live I would fuck her the 23 hours and then that final hour I’ll say a prayer and gracefully bow out the world. Oh yeah and before I go beyonce aint got shit on stacey and as far as halle is concerned she is second class and stacey is in a class by herself or may I say a Dash by herself. damn stacey you are sexy I went to high school in Paramus, NJ with this sweet piece of ass.  Damn, if I only knew then how hot she would be.   She is one fine piece of chocolate well stacey dash looks really nice and looks very young to be over 40 keep it up stacey Yes Dee Dee, Stacey keeps it up. The quality of the info is what keeps me on this site, thanks!

I don't pity him too much.  He still got Kelis' milkshake to cry into.
 
I just wanna know when did bitches start being proud of being hoes, except hoes get paid, she just a ugly ass desperate ass bitch who want 5 seconds of fame. But why would you want fame for fucking? If Nas was my husband I would have been slapped the taste of dick out that bitch mouth!!!
