  Did Cop Murder Mother of His Child for Refusing Abortion? READ THIS. list 1 Did Cop Murder Mother of His Child? Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast Kate Briquelet Horrific 08.14.15 5:15 AM ET Kate Briquelet She lived to help victims of crime. But after two years as a crisis counselor for Texas police, Samantha Dean tragically became a victim herself.

The 29-year-old Austin woman was seven months pregnant when deputies discovered her body in the parking lot of a vacant shopping center. She had worked for the Kyle Police Department, where co-workers were planning a baby shower for her future daughter, whom she’d named Madeline.

Dean’s life was cut short sometime before 2 a.m. on Feb. 4, when a deputy found her shot in the head three times—once at close range, an autopsy showed. A black plastic bag covered her face. The back seat of her Dodge Charger had been removed.

The alleged motive for her murder is chilling: VonTrey Clark—the father of her unborn baby—allegedly hired hit men because Dean refused to have an abortion and wanted child support, authorities charge.

On Wednesday, more disturbing details of the alleged hit job were revealed in a search warrant for Clark’s locker at an Austin police substation.

Texas authorities and the FBI early on named Clark as the chief suspect in Dean’s slaying but haven’t charged him with a crime.

Clark allegedly offered $5,000 to have Dean killed, the latest search warrant affidavit charges. Investigators say Clark’s associate, Aaron Lamont Williams, 32, told them that Clark drove Dean to the parking lot where she was found slain.
 Williams allegedly claimed that Clark’s buddy and former roommate Kevin Watson—in jail on an unrelated drug charge—admitted to killing the mother-to-be with the help of a man named Freddie Smith. The hit men wanted to make it look like a drug deal gone wrong, according to the affidavit.  Cops also arrested Watson’s girlfriend, Kyla Fisk, on charges of tampering with evidence for her role in allegedly hiding the clothes Watson wore the night of the slaying, the Austin American-Statesman reported.

Evidence suggests Dean feared her longtime lover before she was murdered. In a January 21 diary entry, Dean described an encounter in which Clark handcuffed her while wearing his uniform and gun. “Dean felt at one point Clark was going to kill her,” authorities said in a July search warrant affidavit.

Dean reportedly also told Kyle Police Department colleagues that if something happened to her, Clark was behind it.

The couple was on-again, off-again for the last six years, Clark said, according to court documents. He allegedly told investigators their relationship was a secret because he was with another woman.

Police say his whereabouts were mostly unaccounted for the night of the murder. His girlfriend told cops he left his house at 8:30 p.m. on February 3 after they had a fight, and she found it bizarre that he left his cellphone and pager at the residence.

Clark told investigators he drove to a nearby school and sat in his car before walking around, according to a search warrant. Police say there is no surveillance footage of him doing so. He checked into a police substation around midnight, court documents reveal. Police said a Los Angeles-area number called Dean the night of her death, and text messages seemed to lead her to the abandoned shopping center. Authorities placed four cellphones, including Dean’s own, near the crime scene and said they were active around the time of her death, the American-Statesman reported.  Meanwhile, five days after Dean’s murder, Williams sent threatening text messages to an Austin Police Department crisis counselor, authorities charge in court records.  “I [expletive] got her. I am going to get him, then I’m coming for you,” the text said. “I will show you what a crisis is.” According to the warrant, parties including Clark, Watson, Fisk, and Williams had conversations in which they discussed not snitching to police and distancing themselves from each other, KXAN reported. In July, Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo announced that Clark was suspended indefinitely for refusing to attend an in-person interview, then skipping an Internal Affairs hearing days later. Pending the investigation, Clark was not permitted to leave his home without permission, Acevedo said.  Cops soon discovered Clark flew to Indonesia—a country that does not have an extradition treaty with the U.S.—on July 17.  “If you have any dignity, any semblance of humanity, Mr. Clark, get back on that plane and come back to Austin,” Acevedo said during a July 23 news conference.  Clark’s attorney, Bristol Myers, told KXAN that the former officer flew to Indonesia for a medical procedure.  “Officer Clark booked an international round-trip flight in his own name, used his own passport, and was easily located. These are not the hallmarks of a fugitive,” Myers told the TV station. This month, authorities announced the FBI captured Clark in Indonesia but that he’s being held on a visa-related issue. It’s unclear when he will return to the U.S. 

 Some relatives of Dean said they didn’t know Clark and had never met him. 

 “Throughout the pregnancy, she had nothing to do with him,” Michaela Garth, Dean’s cousin, told The Daily Beast. “We didn’t know much of him until this situation happened. Nobody really knew who the father was.”

 Dean’s mother, Kimberly, declined to comment on Clark. She would only tell People that her daughter and husband discussed the father of Dean’s child. 

 “We were a little concerned initially, mostly about the financial end of it,” Kimberly told the magazine last week. “But she was a very good person and a great daughter, so we told her it was going to be okay. We’d do what we needed to do.” Kimberly Dean told The Daily Beast that her daughter—who had two bachelor’s degrees and one master’s—wanted to be a detective. But after overcoming a rare form of cancer in her elbow at age 18, she could not pass physical tests required to become a police officer. Instead, she took a job as the Kyle Police Department’s first and only victims’ services coordinator.  “My daughter was a wonderful person,” Kimberly Dean said. “She let people feel they could be whoever they wanted to be and do whatever they wanted to do… she was a moving motivational speaker for everyone that she met.” The grieving mom said one of her daughter’s biggest accomplishments was staying in school throughout 15 separate surgeries, along with chemotherapy and radiation treatments, after being diagnosed with cancer. She later attended New York’s John Jay College of Criminal Justice for her master’s in forensic psychology, commuting four hours each way from Virginia to attend classes, Kimberly Dean said. Kimberly didn’t want to discuss the murder investigation or the headlines surrounding Clark. “It’s tragic, and it’s sad,” Kimberly Dean said. “It’s something that could happen to anyone. That’s what people need to be aware of—it could happen to anyone.”

You'll Love   Chris Brown’s baby drama continues.  Earlier this week, it was revealed the 25-year-old rapper is a father to 9-month-old baby Royalty. The baby mama is 31-year-old Nia Guzman-Amey, and she also happened to be married to another man for over 10 years when her affair with Brown and subsequent pregnancy happened. According to TMZ, Brown and the former model will now be headed to family court because he believes she leaked the story about Royalty.   Brown reportedly found out about their love child about a month ago, and made a deal with Nia in exchange for her staying silent about the news. Chris is currently paying her substantially more than he would be if they had court-ordered child support. TMZ notes, “There’s a scale on how much a parent pays, based largely on income. We’re told Chris upped that amount and in return demanded that she keep her lips sealed.” His lawyers are in the process of drafting the legal documents so that he can ask a judge for an order requiring him to pay child support. Resultantly, he’ll actually pay his baby mama less than he is currently. Meanwhile, Chris Brown’s ex Karrueche Tran has seemingly been celebrating her public breakup. The model has been posting party pics to her Instagram ever since the news broke.  
Floyd Mayweather’sBaby Mama is Suing Himfor $20 Million(REPORT)
 Getty Images It’s been estimated that Floyd Mayweather Jr. took home around $178 million for defeating Manny Pacquiao in what was dubbed “The Fight of the Century” last Saturday, May 2.  The check probably hasn’t even cleared yet, and someone else already has her eye on his money! According to a new report, his baby mama, Josie Harris, has plans to sue the boxer for lying about their infamous 2010 domestic violence incident!

RELATED: Jamie Foxx Slammed After Butchering the National Anthem Ahead of the Mayweather-Pacquiao Fight In the lawsuit, she’s arguing that she’s been branded a liar and a drug addict following his April 14 sit down with Katie — and she reportedly wants $20 million to compensate.

It appears things aren't going well between Chris Brown and Nia Guzman, with whom he shares one child. The pair have been locked in a nasty battle over custody and child support for many months now, with new reports suggesting Guzman, 31, is asking for a pretty hefty payout. Brown, 26, gave viewers some insight into his tumultuous relationship with Guzman during a recent Twitter rant. According to E! Online, the Grammy winner hopped on the social media site Friday morning to get a few things off his chest. In his first message he said it was shameful that some "females" use children as an easy way of getting money. He added that many men in his situation would have shirked their parental responsibilities, but he chose to take it on head first. In another post he shamed women using their children "as leverage," and praised all the responsible men of the world stepping up to be fathers. Although Brown did not mention Guzman's name it appears clear that he is making reference to their current situation with daughter Royalty.  Some men my age run from their responsibility as fathers. I embrace mine. Just sucks that some females use children as meal tickets. 	— Chris Brown (@chrisbrown) August 7, 2015 Using a child as leverage is never ok. The highest praise to the men who actually want their kids. 	— Chris Brown (@chrisbrown) August 7, 2015 As TMZ reported Monday, Guzman is believed to have filed legal paperwork requesting a change in their current visitation agreement and wants Brown to pay close to $15,000 in child support. She reportedly asked that Brown be granted supervised visits only as she did not feel that he was responsible enough to care for Royalty, 1, on his own. She is reportedly seeking full custody as she fears it is detrimental to Royalty to be around Brown and his friends as many of his associates have alleged substance abuse issues. Guzman's concerns over her daughter's safety came after several incidents occurred at Brown's Los Angeles home. On July 15, the R&B singer's home was broken into by armed intruders. The suspects locked Brown's aunt, who was in the home during the incident, in a closet as they rummaged through his belongings. They were able to get away with money and other items. His home was broken into once prior in May by a fan who stripped down and spent several days inside the home. The 21-year-old woman is said to have spray painted "I love you" and "Mrs. Brown" on numerous surfaces in the home, including kitchen counters and across the side of two of his vehicles. Fortunately, Royalty was not present during either incident.  The IBT Pulse Newsletter keeps you connected to the biggest stories unfolding in the global economy.

 TMZ Live: Paul McCartney: Music Legend REJECTED at Grammy After-Party Kanye West Shopping at Jacob & Co.  Chris Brown had a $10k agreement in place with his baby mama, Nia Guzman … but when she shipped little Royalty off to hang with Chris' mom, he cut her off.  Sources close to Nia tell TMZ ... Royalty's parents finally came to an agreement on child support ... settling on $10k per month from CB, starting July 1. As we reported, Chris' camp said Nia initially wanted $15k, but he only wanted to pay $2,500.   We’re told the new deal blew up though, when Daddy wanted Royalty this week -- but she was already hanging with grandma in Virginia. Since relations between Chris and his mom have been bad for years now ... our sources say Chris got pissed.    We're told Nia's claiming this is the first time she's ever denied Chris visitation, but looks like once was enough. We broke the story ... Chris is filing to establish paternity in court, so a judge can settle their child support and custody issues.  According our sources, Nia never wanted to go to court because she didn’t want to seem like a gold digger.   HERE'S THE RUNDOWN The Weeknd's Big Night Ended Face-to-Face with Police Kaley Cuoco May Have a New Man: Sam Hunt!

 Manny Pacquiao Wearing Nike   Gilbert Arenas is about to lose access to his 4 children if his baby mama has her way ... and it's all over a 15 second video of their 8-year-old son on the hood of a moving vehicle. Gilbert was on "TMZ Live" Tuesday and scoffed at baby mama Laura Govan's allegation he's a reckless parent by putting little Alijah on the front of a Polaris Slingshot and driving at around 15 MPH.  Gilbert told us he got an email from Laura's people saying they were going to try and take custody away from him, and TMZ Sports has learned he told the truth. Our sources say Laura -- who currently has primary physical custody -- will go to court and ask the judge to significantly reduce Gilbert's visitation. She also wants the judge to impose safeguards so the kids aren't put in dangerous situations. As one Laura source put it, "This is just the straw that broke the camel's back. He's done many other things." In case you didn't know, Gilbert and Laura have been at war for several years, and it's getting worse ... or as one source put it, "ferocious."

 TMZ Live: Paul McCartney: Music Legend REJECTED at Grammy After-Party Kanye West Shopping at Jacob & Co.  A lot of rappers run for the hills when they knock up some random chick, but Chris Brown wants to move that random chick to the hills ... the Hollywood Hills, so he can be close to his little girl. TMZ broke the story ... Chris got Nia Guzman, a 31-year-old Houston woman, pregnant and now he's the proud dad of 9-month-old Royalty. We know Chris has spent time with the baby since finding out he's the father, but it's difficult because Royalty is 1372 air miles away from Chris' L.A. home. Sources connected with Chris tell us ... he's asked Nia to move to L.A. with their daughter and he'll foot the bill for housing. He's not romantically involved with Nia, but we're told he genuinely wants a meaningful relationship with Royalty. He's saying he'd like to see her every day. Chris is in "negotiations" with Nia over support. He's paying her more than he's required to under the law, but he got pissed off when she started talking about their relationship and vowed to go to court where a judge would reduce the child support he's informally paying. Our sources say Chris has told Nia, if she moves to L.A. he won't pull the trigger on a child support court case and she'll continue getting the premium amount, in addition to a place to live. Nia hasn't decided, but it sounds like a good deal.   HERE'S THE RUNDOWN The Weeknd's Big Night Ended Face-to-Face with Police Kaley Cuoco May Have a New Man: Sam Hunt!

You don’t want him to go to JAIL do you??” she complained before adding a dagger of an hashtag, “#7monthsbehindandcounting.” “Some of y’all ni**as need to call ya baby momz & ask they boyfriend what they want for fathers day,” she continued in a separate Instagram post, utilizing that classic Kermit the Frog meme.  After the posts began to pick up steam, Ace Hood seemingly responded indirectly tweeting, “The truth will Reveal itself. #BlessU.” Sarratt deleted the posts which likely alludes to angry phone call and some sort of resolution.

 (Getty Images) Chris Brown has reportedly asked his baby mama to move to Los Angeles with their daughter Royalty so he can see her “every day.” As Gossip Cop reported, the bombshell news that Brown had fathered a child broke earlier this month, when it was revealed he was dad to a 9-month-old baby girl. The baby mama was identified as Nia Guzman (sometimes reported to be Nia Gonzalez), a Houston-based model whom Brown had partied with on occasion. Brown only recently found out Royalty is his child, who was apparently conceived while Brown was with on-and-off girlfriend Karrueche Tran. Brown and his camp have yet to comment publicly on the news, but in the weeks since the revelation, Royalty has been photographed backstage at one of the singer’s concerts, and another picture emerged showing a baby bottle on his tour bus. Now TMZ reports Brown wants Guzman to move to Los Angeles’ Hollywood Hills with Royalty, and he will cover all housing costs. While Brown and Guzman are not romantically involved with each other, the star is said to want “a meaningful relationship” with his daughter, something that would be difficult if they continue to be separated by more than a 1,000 miles. Upon finding out that he is Royalty’s father, Brown reportedly began paying Guzman a large amount of child support. But, as Gossip Cop reported, after details leaked to the media, the star was said to have threatened to go to court to have the dollar amount officially set, and likely lowered, by a judge. TMZ, however, says that he and Guzman are currently in “negotiations” over his financial obligation, and that Brown will not take his baby mama to court if she agrees to move. Gossip Cop will continue to have updates.

Ludacris might be newly married to his bride Eudoxie, but he's fighting another woman in court for custody of his toddler daughter, and the whole thing's getting ugly. 
According to TMZ, Tamika Fuller (pictured above on the far right) says the rapper-cum-actor initially wanted her to abort their daughter Cai Bridges when she told him she was pregnant. Fuller says he "offered her $10,000 and a house if she lost the baby." 
	Whoa. Here's hoping none of that story is true. Advertisement

												 Photo: Teresa Lee/Getty ImagesCelebrity photographer Terry Richardson — the man accused of soliciting sexual favors from young models looking for a break — is going to be someone’s dad. He announced the news last month on Instagram after The Post printed the scoop. “Babies’ first Page Six shout out!” he wrote. “Skinny and I are very excited to let you guys know that we are expecting TWINS in the spring!!!” So just who is the woman carrying the future offspring of one of NYC’s most controversial shutterbugs? Meet Alexandra “Skinny” Bolotow, the 32-year-old longtime Richardson assistant — and friend of Martha Stewart — who, confidantes say, might finally tame the self-professed “pervert” once and for all. In the past few years, Richardson — who has photographed everyone from Barack Obama to Lady Gaga — has come under fire for allegedly manipulating models to engage in sexual acts. Model Jamie Peck has recalled a 2010 shoot with him where Richardson offered to make tea with her used tampon, before suggesting Peck manually stimulate him. Another model, Charlotte Waters, says she was Richardson’s “sex puppet” during a 2009 gig. “I collaborated with consenting adult women who were fully aware of the nature of the work,” Richardson told Page Six last year in response to the flurry of accusations. Bolotow came to his defense last June in a New York magazine story questioning whether the photographer was a predator. “I think part of being a strong woman is owning the decisions that you’ve made in your life,” she said. “Trying to put the onus onto someone else for your own decisions is really cowardly and kind of dishonest.”  Babies' first Page Six shout out! We weren't planning to make this news quite so public quite so soon, because we are very cautious after going through some very difficult and heartbreaking losses, and always afraid of jinxing it, but since the cat is out of the bag… Skinny and I are very excited to let you guys know that we are expecting TWINS in the spring!!! This has been a difficult journey and we are so thankful to be surrounded by so much love and support from our friends and family, and some incredibly smart doctors! I'm sure the kids will be excited to  use this as a Throwback Thursday one of these days!!! 👶🏻👶🏻🙀 A photo posted by Terry Richardson (@terryrichardson) on Oct 19, 2015 at 6:57am PDT  Certainly, Bolotow — who grew up in preppy Providence, R.I., where she attended an all-girls Quaker high school — didn’t feel preyed upon when she met Richardson in the early aughts, as an undergrad at NYU. “He was at some downtown party taking pictures and Alex went up to him and was like, ‘I’d love to work for you,’ ” an industry insider tells The Post. “She was with her boyfriend at the time and Terry reportedly said, ‘If you suck your boyfriend’s d – – k right here at the party while he holds you upside down, and let me photograph it, I’ll let you work for me.’ ” She got the job. As an intern, Bolotow posed for Richardson while performing oral sex on him, a “slut” tiara atop her head. The picture was published in his 2005 book, “Kibosh.” Bolotow — who dropped out of NYU to work with Richardson (she’s since received a degree from Columbia) — has gained a reputation for her don’t-give-a-damn antics. The insider recalls hooking up with Bolotow while she was on a 2006 break from Richardson. “She goes, ‘Are you sure you want me to go down on you? . . . Because if I do, no [other oral sex] will ever compare to this and [you’ll] be ruined for the rest of your life,’ ” he says.  Happy Hump Day 👶🏻👶🏻🚼 A photo posted by Terry Richardson (@terryrichardson) on Nov 11, 2015 at 7:53am PST  But friends say there’s more to Bolotow’s relationship with 50-year-old Richardson than just sex and lewd photos. “He couldn’t function professionally without her,” says the insider. “She sort of became his art director and muse and boss . . . She’s extremely opinionated. Terry can be kind of insecure, and Alex definitely gave him confidence.” He even says one image that made it into a past Richardson ad campaign for Sisley was actually shot by Bolotow herself. Sometimes Bolotow’s been too prominent in Richardson’s professional life, according to Gavin McInnes, a co-founder of Vice Media who worked with Richardson regularly from 2000 to 2005. He was annoyed when, in 2004, Bolotow advised Richardson to pass on starring in a Vice reality show because “it was below him,” McInnes tells The Post. During the decade in which Bolotow has worked with Richardson on and off, their personal relationship has been similarly fluid: He’s dated several women, including model Susan Eldridge and Audrey Gelman, former spokeswoman for NYC Comptroller Scott Stringer. And while there are perks to dating Richardson — such as spending last Thanksgiving with pal Martha Stewart (who will be at Bolotow’s upcoming baby shower) — those close to the parents-to-be say they are very much in love. “This wasn’t an accidental pregnancy,” says a friend of Bolotow’s. As for Bolotow’s parents, multiple sources tell The Post that her lawyer father is a bit in the dark about his daughter’s salacious shoots with Richardson. “I think people want to think that she’s an idiot who likes to show her tits off, but she’s really bright,” says Bolotow’s friend. “Who knows what her next act will be?” One thing’s for sure, she doesn’t want to just be known as Richardson’s baby mama. When declining The Post’s request for an interview, Bolotow emailed: “You only care about me because of who I’m f - - king, which is so lame.”

Baby Mama Leave a Reply Cancel reply Departments Twitter  BY TREY POPP | Photo by Candace diCarlo JERSEY GIRL MOTHERHOOD LEGAL EAGLE MATCHMAKER POSTMODERN PARENTHOOD  After overcoming her own infertility, Melissa Brisman has helped hundreds of couples become parents as a legal entrepreneur in the little-discussed realm of pregnancy for pay.  If the workplace is a window into the American soul, Melissa Brisman W’93’s office is a singular slice of motherhood and apple pie. Like many lawyers, she keeps an array of framed diplomas and honorary certificates on a wall close to her desk. And like many parents, she keeps a collection of Crayola and marker drawings closer. In one that hangs within arm’s reach of her chair, a blue baby stroller rolls across the top of a page whose lower half depicts a pint-sized stick figure tucked into a little bed. Download a PDF of this article Baby pictures teem on the walls of Brisman’s firm. A giant collage of birth announcements hangs beside the reception door—perhaps eight square feet crammed with wide-eyed newborns—and more of equal proportions adorn the cubicles extending back toward Brisman’s office. The babies are part of a group whose number belies the exceptional nature of their parentage. They are among the roughly 2,000 children Brisman has arranged to bring into the world via paid gestational surrogates. The stick-figure baby by Brisman’s desk has special significance, because it’s the work of her genetic daughter, Simmie, who was born to a Pennsylvanian named Barb in 2003. Simmie has her father’s open face and smile, and an easygoing sweetness that’s only halfway reminiscent of her mother, who is not really easygoing at all. Brisman (née Melissa Levy) has a way of imbuing even solicitude and heartfelt sympathy with the same hard-charging energy that’s marked her pioneering career in commercial surrogacy. Classmate Peter Bayard C’93 remembers her as both an “extremely motivated student” and an “extremely sweet, caring, and loyal friend.” The doubled adverb would probably stick to any of Brisman’s traits. The moment I stepped into her New Jersey office she began talking at a pace that, sustained over the course of a long afternoon that ended in the casual family den of her home, yielded a transcript measuring 98 pages of single-spaced text. In the 36 hours after we parted company, she followed up with no fewer than 18 emails, containing everything from links to recent TV appearances to an emotional testimonial about Simmie’s birth mother, composed on her iPhone. But before she became the legal entrepreneur behind one of the first and largest surrogacy agencies in the eastern United States—in a state that prohibits pregnancy for pay—Melissa Brisman was a young woman medically unable to bear children of her own, and that’s the place to begin.   Brisman grew up in Parsippany, New Jersey, the only daughter of an engineer and a schoolteacher who gave up teaching to raise Melissa and her younger brother. Her childhood memories would seem familiar to many middle-class Americans who came of age in the 1970s and ’80s, during what now seems like the twilight of middle-class prosperity. She attended a public high school built two years before she was born. Her family lived modestly but securely, supported by a salary man who dreamed of owning a Cadillac for as long as he drove his ageless Chevy, but waited until Melissa graduated from college to buy one. By that time, Melissa’s medical inability to carry a pregnancy, despite functioning ovaries, was a fact deeply woven into the fabric of her life. “I can’t remember when I didn’t know,” she says. “My parents always knew … but you know, your parents are your parents. They downplay it.” The obstetrician-gynecologist she began seeing as a young woman took a slightly different tack. All the way through her college years, he would send her news clippings about babies born to surrogate mothers and advances in fertility medicine. “He was like my little cheerleader,” Brisman recalls. “He would be like, ‘This is the first baby, like, born this way. This is going to be you.” His patient was plainly not an easy person to thwart. As a high-schooler, Brisman had been so fixated on attending Wharton that she barely applied anywhere else, notwithstanding the apparent odds against her. “No one in my neighborhood went to an Ivy League school,” she says. “That was just, like, unheard of.” She received a rejection letter—but not, one might say, the message it contained. After enrolling at County College of Morris for the summer, Brisman went to SUNY-Binghampton in the fall, “and then I just kept applying, every semester. I just kept applying to Penn. Finally, after a year, they let me in.” She wasted no time proving she belonged, blazing a straight-A path through an undergraduate career that included a stint as vice president of the Wharton Finance Club and culminated with a dean’s award for academic achievement. Yet she remained, in some ways, a fish out of water. “She was down-to-earth,” says Kelly Spyra W’93, who fondly recalls being a beneficiary of Brisman’s knack for coupon cutting and sniffing out two-for-one restaurant deals. Compared to their contemporaries at Wharton, Sprya adds, Brisman was more focused on what she wanted to do with her life and less shy about speaking out when she needed help. For Peter Bayard, now a managing director of Natixis Global Asset Management in New York, Brisman was the suburban antithesis of the haughty Manhattan prep school clique he’d always run with. “I was so used to being friends with the rich, spoiled, materialistic crowd—which deep down I wasn’t fond of,” he recalls. “And then there was Melissa—who was the opposite of rich, spoiled, and materialistic. “Knowing and being friends with Melissa made me a better person,” he adds. Her “sweet disposition” just happened to coexist with a level of drive that could be fearsome or comical, depending on where it was focused. Dan Brisman came into Melissa’s life on a blind date in the wake of a Harvard Law School mixer where she had met his brother. He remembers how, after they’d dated for a few months, she went about moving their relationship to the next level. “She decided that we should be engaged before Passover, so she could tell her family,” he laughs after joining us in Melissa’s office, during a slack half-hour between the end of his rounds as a rehabilitation physician and ferrying Simmie from school to Hebrew class. “So she put her ring size on my refrigerator, so that I would have a clue.” It would become a familiar dynamic. A few years later, desperate to escape the pit of an apartment they’d been renting, Melissa got her sights set on a house with a big yard in Bergen County. “I wanted to buy this house,” she recalls. “But, you know what? He had a basketball game.” “No, we had playoffs!” objects Dan, who remains an avid recreational player. “So he would not come to see the house.” “It was playoffs!” “So I just put a deposit on it and bought it.” Dan saw the house three days later. “I was fine with it.” They still live there.   Melissa was barely out of Harvard Law, working as a tax attorney at Goodwin Proctor in Boston, when she set about trying to find a woman to have her children. Had she been able to bear them herself, she doubts she would have started thinking about babies in her early 20s. But in-vitro fertilization was an even longer road in the mid-1990s than it is now. And finding a fertility clinic willing to implant embryos created by her eggs and Dan’s sperm into the womb of a paid surrogate proved a tall task. Brisman says five doctors turned her away before Merle Berger, of Boston IVF, agreed to take her on as a patient. Berger had done some training on the West Coast, where more liberal attitudes prevailed around gestational surrogacy. But things were much different in the northeast, and Brisman’s case represented new territory for Berger—so much so that, as Melissa remembers it, he kept it under wraps from his practice partners. Berger doesn’t recall concealing anything, but affirms that he’d never been involved with commercial gestational surrogacy before Brisman sought him out. “This is somewhat of a Puritan society,” he says. “And carrying a baby for somebody else is not something that was considered an acceptable form of treatment—because of the ethical issues involved. And which still are involved. Is it okay to pay a woman to do this? Or is it usurping only poor women who need the money? It’s a controversial issue, and back then, even more so.” In 1987 Massachusetts had become one of the first states to mandate the coverage of fertility treatment by health insurers. When Brisman attempted to exercise her right to covered IVF procedures, including harvesting her healthy eggs, her insurer denied payment. Since her eggs wouldn’t be going back into her own uterus, the company argued, she fell outside of the state’s mandate. Brisman filed suit. The insurer capitulated, covering the IVF process but requiring her to pay the (much more modest) cost of transferring the embryo into her surrogate’s womb. (Nearly 20 years later, coverage of fertility procedures and surrogacy-related maternity care still varies widely. According to the Henry J. Kaiser Family foundation, 15 states mandate infertility coverage, although many permit exceptions based on religious objections or the size of an employer offering a group insurance plan. Some employer-based insurance plans explicitly exclude maternity care for surrogate pregnancies; others cover it. The Affordable Care Act mandates that plans offered through the ACA marketplace cover maternity care for all pregnancies, but does not mandate infertility treatment.) Finding a surrogate was a challenge of a different sort. Classified ads in The Boston Globe and the Phoenix—an alternative newsweekly—set Brisman’s phone ringing off the hook. “Every crazy person on the face of this earth was calling my home,” Brisman remembers—from apparent “cocaine addicts” to people who’d say, “I don’t have a home. Can I live in your house?” Crank callers had a field day. One candidate seemed promising—until the Brismans discovered that the car she’d claimed to own was actually a series of borrowed ones she’d driven to their meetings, raising a red flag about the stability of her living situation. After expanding the scope of their advertisements to smaller publications with circulations outside the big metropolitan market, they finally found someone who inspired their confidence. Linda was a college-educated resident of a small town in Maine with three kids of her own, who’d seen an ad in a local paper that had struck a chord. Though she had “never had a burning desire to be a mother,” Linda now says, filling a phone line with frankness and warmth, she had conceived twins the first time she and her husband began trying. “I had a very dear friend who couldn’t have kids, and I felt guilty that God gave me two. I actually agonized over giving her one of the twins, but of course I couldn’t do that.” Pregnancy and labor turned out to be smooth sailing, both for the twins and the singleton she had next—a 10-pound boy she delivered without pain medication. “In the meantime I found another friend who couldn’t have kids, and it just broke my heart,” she says. A couple years later, she stumbled across an unexpected salve. “Lo and behold, there was an ad in the local free paper, and it said: Wanted, Mom to be Gestational Carrier.” She answered it and eventually decided to arrange a meeting. “Because of where my heart was, it could have been any couple sitting there and I would have done it,” she says. In fact, she would go on to be a surrogate four more times. “As long as I knew they were sincere, I would help anyone.” At the time, she was the office manager at an assisted living community. She and her husband also had a building in which they rented out several apartments. “The first time I did it,” she maintains, “the money wasn’t the factor at all. It was just a nice benefit of it. I don’t like being pregnant. I wasn’t doing it for that. Truly, it was because of my passion, and the ache that my heart felt for my friend. “And I knew for a fact that I wouldn’t want a baby back if it wasn’t mine genetically,” she adds. “God, no! I really didn’t want any more kids. So I was the perfect candidate.” The pregnancy was bumpy. It began with the implantation of three embryos in Linda’s uterus—over the initial objections of both Linda and Dan. “I was the one who overruled them,” Melissa says candidly, “because I was such a pain. [Linda] didn’t want to carry triplets. And my husband was like, ‘What are you, bananas, having three babies at one time?’” But implanting three embryos was fairly common at a time when the odds were less than 50 percent that any one of them would produce a viable pregnancy. “And my physician was telling me that we were on the five-year plan—don’t expect it to work the first time.” As it turned out, two of them took right off the bat. The Brismans started making visits to Maine. “Dan and Melissa were involved with [my] kids,” Linda recalls. “They even came up, it was during the Beanie Baby craze—when they were metered out, or however they were rationed—and Dan and Melissa came and got in line with me so I could get Beanie Babies for the kids. It was so funny. They came up and brought them Christmas gifts. That’s something that I think is common. It’s not about the gifts. They were part of the family for those nine months.” Yet by both women’s accounts, Melissa’s anxiety introduced a lot of friction into the relationship. To overcome the distance between them, they scheduled weekly phone conversations—on Thursday nights, right after Seinfeld (which they all watched) gave way to Veronica’s Closet, (which they all hated). But their shared verdict on NBC’s “Must See TV” lineup wasn’t enough to bridge every divide. “I was so nervous about the pregnancy,” Melissa recalls, quickly bringing an example to mind. “She used to be a big coffee drinker. And she used to always drink those really large Dunkin’ Donut coffees. And that used to drive me insane. I don’t know why it drove me insane. But it drove me insane. And the doctor would have to tell me, ‘Melissa, you need to calm down. It’s a cup of coffee. She’s six feet tall. The babies are doing fine. She’s a really good person. You need to leave her alone.’” “I was pregnant, so of course I had the hormones raging also,” Linda remembers. “And it got so bad that when she called, I didn’t want to talk to her … Dan and I actually bonded more than Melissa and I did—during the pregnancy, anyway. “I went through this with all my couples, really, on different levels,” she adds. “When you cannot be in control of something that is so critical—something that is so near and dear to you, and you have zero control over it—that’s a terrible feeling. And it’s a hopeless, helpless feeling, and that’s how she dealt with it.” For Brisman, it was a dynamic that would rear up constantly in the years ahead, after she quit tax law to build a career around surrogacy. Because of the cost, which can surpass $100,000—since medical expenses can easily outstrip the $25,000-$30,000 typically paid to carriers—it is by and large a service available only to a very affluent minority. “The more educated and well-off that you are, the more you’re in control of your life,” Brisman remarks. “But you’re not in control of your surrogate. She’s a person. And that loss of control is horrible. The more educated you are, the worse that it is, because the more you [usually] have the ability to control things. And you cannot control a pregnancy. “It kind of prepares you for kids,” she adds after a pause, breaking into a classic parental laugh. “Because you cannot control your child.” Andrew and Benjamin Brisman were born in a Maine hospital before a throng of medical residents who’d crowded into the room to witness the hospital’s first delivery by a gestational surrogate. “Oh yeah, I had so many people watching my drug-free, vaginal delivery,” Linda cracks—riffing on a bit that she’s incorporated into a late-blooming career in standup comedy (and adding that declining drugs was entirely her choice). “It was quite amazing.” Melissa cut Andrew’s umbilical cord. Benjamin, who came out breech and lost oxygen momentarily (to no lasting detriment), was handled by the medical team. Then Melissa did something that Linda remembers more vividly than anything from the previous nine months. “She bent down and kissed my forehead. And everything that happened during that pregnancy was nothing, compared to that moment. It was all about that moment. Everything else was just hormones and fears—it wasn’t who we were as people or why we did what we did … It was all about that delivery. And truly, she bent down and kissed my forehead. And then Melissa stayed in my room with me, and I helped them with the twins. They had never diapered a baby before, so I showed them how to do that. She stayed in the room with me, and everything was just fine.” The Brisman family’s return home a few days later left Linda with an unexpected feeling. “After the birth, you feel lost,” she reflects. “Because you’ve been such an important part of these people’s lives, for nine months—longer, because of the planning and the transfer. And all this time, you’re so important to them, and they treat you like you’re so important. And after the pregnancy you kind of mourn the loss of that relationship.” Her voice wavers a little on the phone. “So, sitting there—I’m going to cry—that first Thursday night after I’d given birth, Dan called me,” she remembers. “He didn’t keep doing it. But I can’t even begin to tell you how much that meant to me. It just—oh my God, I love them so much. They’re just really good people. Not all couples are good. But they were.”   What the Brismans and their paid gestational carrier did was legal in the state of Maine. Or, to put it a slightly different way, it wasn’t illegal. As of 2015, there are no statutes in Maine law that expressly permit or prohibit commercial surrogacy. Maine is nevertheless considered a relatively permissive state, by dint of favorable court rulings. For instance, in 2012 the Supreme Court of Maine overturned a district court’s refusal to declare Robert and Celia Nolan the legal parents of a child, created by his sperm and her egg, born to another woman who had carried it according to a contract to which all parties had agreed. (In that case, the carrier and her husband had joined the Nolans in their legal complaint; they did not want to be listed as the legal parents of what they considered the Nolans’ child.) Other states treat surrogacy differently. Nevada explicitly permits compensation to be paid to gestational carriers, provided that the child is genetically unrelated to the carrier. In the District of Columbia, surrogacy contracts of all kinds are void, and punishable with a fine of up to $10,000 and a year in jail. New Jersey and New York—whose border lies less than a mile to the northeast of Brisman’s agency, Reproductive Possibilities—ban commercial surrogacy. Most state codes do not address surrogacy at all, partly because discussions about pregnancy have a way of leading to discussions about abortion, which are toxic for the average American legislator. That leaves case law to serve as an imperfect guide. New Jersey’s prohibition of surrogacy dates to the sensational Baby M case. In 1984, a woman named Mary Beth Whitehead entered into a surrogacy contract with William and Becky Stern. It stipulated that Whitehead would carry a baby created by William’s sperm and one of her own eggs, and would then relinquish her parental rights to the Sterns. Less than one day after transferring custody of the newborn, Whitehead decided that she wanted the baby back. The case made its way to the Supreme Court of New Jersey, whose 1988 decision invalidated surrogacy contracts as being contrary to public policy. (The Court remanded the specific matter of Baby M to a family court to determine custody according to the “best interest of the child”; the lower court awarded custody to the Sterns and visitation rights to Whitehead.) Although the Baby M case was emblematic of the main concern around traditional surrogacy, the rise of gestational surrogacy has flipped the dynamic. Custody disputes in gestational surrogacy mostly arise when intentional parents (as the commissioning parties are typically called) try to back out of an agreement. Earlier this year, former View co-host Sherri Shepherd attempted to evade legal custody for a child whose birth to a surrogate, using an egg from an anonymous donor, she had arranged with her then-husband John Sally. Shepherd and Sally filed for divorce during the pregnancy. In April a Pennsylvania judge declared her to be the legal mother of the 8-month-old, and liable for child support. Anything can happen during a pregnancy’s nine months to complicate surrogacy arrangements, from an apparent change of heart like Shepherd’s to the death of one of the involved parties. Uncertainty is a feature of all sorts of long-term contracts, but the intimate nature of procreation and family law makes surrogacy contracts particularly challenging from a public-policy perspective. Many states are effectively legal vacuums when it comes to surrogacy. Intentional parents must request a legal order for their names to be placed on a child’s birth certificate, instead of the carrier’s name. Depending on conditions like marital status and sexual orientation, the odds that these petitions will be granted can vary from county to county—either on account of particular judges, or the proclivities of bureaucratic agencies responsible for registering births. The denial of a legal birth order can put intentional parents in the strange position of having to adopt their genetic child—a process that frequently takes months and requires them to submit to criminal background checks, FBI clearance, and in-home supervision by a social worker. Meanwhile the carrier is at risk of being legally responsible for the child. Shortly after the birth of her twins, Brisman abandoned tax law to build a legal practice focusing on surrogacy. She cold-called fertility doctors, offering to give them seminars on the legal aspects of gestational surrogacy that doubled as advertisements for her burgeoning agency. “I was one of the first lawyers to join the American Society of Reproductive Medicine,” Brisman says. “Every year I would petition them to get me to give a lecture. And in the beginning no one showed up to my lectures. But now, like, 500 people might show up.” “She was a pioneer,” Merle Berger says, “in setting up, as an attorney, organizations which would both search out and find surrogates and do the legal work. There weren’t many choices. In fact, there still aren’t.” In 2001, the first year she went out on her own, she took a case filed by a married couple who sought a “pre-birth order”—a request, in advance of the birth of their genetic child to a surrogate carrier, for their names to be placed on the birth certificate. Their request was opposed by the state Department of Public Health. The case went to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Brisman was 28 years old. “It was funny,” she remembers, “because I had my backpack from law school still. It was burgundy. I still remember. And I was wearing my sneakers, and I was the youngest person there because there were all these, like, 50-year-old men.” She won the case, and then successfully argued before courts in other states to win parentage orders either before birth or on the same day. In Maine, where she wasn’t licensed to practice, she was permitted to act in a pro hac vice capacity to do birth orders for her own twins. “Then I did it in Pennsylvania, and then I did it in New York, and then in New Jersey.” The New Jersey action involved two cases. In one, a woman was carrying a child created by an egg belonging to her cancer-stricken sister, which had been frozen prior to a bone-marrow transplant and cancer treatment, and implanted after her sister had been cancer-free for five years. In the other, a woman was carrying the genetic child of her brother and his wife. The idea that the child’s birth certificate would list the blood siblings as parents was “repulsive” to the altruistic carrier, recalls Brisman, who overcame resistance from the attorney general to obtain a pre-birth order that would become effective 72 hours after the birth, in keeping with a mandatory waiting period the state imposes before custody of any child can be transferred from its birth mother. (Waiting periods are a common feature of adoption law, which, along with sperm and egg donation, is a part of Brisman’s practice.) Brisman has also successfully advocated on behalf of gay parents seeking to grow their families through surrogacy. In 2005 she filed an action in Pennsylvania seeking a declaration of legal paternity for two men, so that they would be recognized as the legal parents of a child upon its birth to a surrogate. In 2008, she helped two New York women gain a legal declaration of maternity in a similar case. More recently, she has helped draft a bill for the New Jersey legislature that would recognize gestational surrogacy contracts and regulate some of their provisions (such as guaranteeing a carrier’s access to independent counsel, and requiring both parties to pass a psychological evaluation). It has been passed twice by the legislature, but vetoed by Governor Chris Christie each time, including this June, the day before he officially announced his campaign for the presidency.   Though New Jersey and New York prohibit their citizens from receiving financial compensation for pregnancy, residents can legally enter surrogacy contracts with carriers residing in more permissive states. So finding carriers is the most important piece of Brisman’s business. She targets “working to middle-class” women whose husbands or partners are the primary breadwinners. “We don’t want to see that all their income is coming from support or welfare,” Brisman says. “They have to be stable and be able to feed themselves.” Surrogacy, she adds, “could be about the money” for these women, “but it can’t be 100 percent about the money.” When she started out, Brisman would use advertising clearinghouses to target regional publications toward the end of their publication schedules, when their ad rates dropped. “You could buy every Penny-Saver in all of New England,” she explains. She’d take out ads in whichever ones had unsold space going for about half-price. She would also buy space on paper placemats in small-town diners. She showed me a recent one from Flapjack’s Restaurant and Pub in Dillsburg, Pennsylvania. “You might pay a few hundred dollars [for this ad], and no one calls all year. But next year we might get two people. So these things we still try.” Increasingly, the search for surrogates has moved to the internet. So if you Google “gestational surrogacy Rhode Island,” for example, an ad for Brisman’s firm pops up on the first page of search results. Another way you might find out about Reproductive Possibilities is on the back of a cash-register receipt from a place like Walmart or Dollar General. “That’s really expensive, like thousands per month,” Brisman says. “The cost of my advertising is insane.” But it’s effective. “Normally, on a Monday, we get, like, 60 applications to be a surrogate,” she says. The firm looks for women between 21 and 40 years old who’ve already had children—which is partially an ethical precaution, to ensure that any risk a surrogate pregnancy might pose to a carrier’s ability to bear future children will not deprive her of having any offspring whatsoever. There are other basic criteria. Surrogates must have body-mass indexes within a certain range, and can’t be taking mental-health medications. They have to pass driving, credit, and criminal-background checks. The firm inspects Facebook profiles—“a royal pain in the ass,” Brisman says, that can raise important red flags. They’ve discovered applicants who have had their children taken away by state children’s-welfare agencies. Or “somebody who says they had no tattoos, and there’s, like, five of them on their arm in their Facebook picture.” The firm doesn’t actually care about tattoos, she explains, “but you can’t have a tattoo within six months of an embryo transfer unless you have documentation from the tattoo parlor that it was hepatitis-free.” After that screening comes a series of three interviews. “Then we send someone to their home to, like, look in their refrigerator, test their water, interview the family, make sure that they have a safe place to live,” Brisman says. “So, out of those initial 60 applicants, we might get two.” If there’s a typical profile, it’s “someone who married their high-school sweetheart. They make $50,000 combined. They have three kids. This is a good way for them to make some extra money. Pregnancy is easy for them. And they are just all excited to be on a plane. “Or sometimes they’re petrified,” Brisman adds. “We did once have a carrier who was so scared to go on a plane, we had to walk her through it. She’d delivered three babies, but getting on a plane… The clinic was in California, so we had to buy her tickets to a Beverly Hills rich-and-famous tour to convince her to get on the plane, she was so scared.” I spoke with four carriers. One used the money to pay off student loans from nursing school. Another was able to move her family to a better home in another state. “It helped my family tremendously,” she told me. “I don’t know when I would have been able to come up with a chunk of money to use on a down payment for a house.” Linda, who carried Brisman’s twins, maintains that altruism remained an important motive in her subsequent surrogate pregnancies, but adds that she became savvier about negotiating the contractual terms with each one. “Definitely, the money was a piece of it,” she says. “After you get a taste of getting that money, it becomes a piece of it.” Carrying the Brisman’s twins allowed her to remodel some of her home. “I would tease Dan and Melissa—when they came to visit, I’d say, ‘This is the Dan and Melissa family room.’ We joked about it.” Yet the last of her five surrogate pregnancies, which happened to be the only one arranged by an agency other than Brisman’s, culminated in “the worst thing I’ve ever endured in my life.” She miscarried at 22 weeks. The loss of the child, a devastating blow, was compounded by the intended parents’ refusal to cover $300 of lost wages due to the miscarriage—despite the fact that their contract stipulated an allowance for up to $3,000. “They turned their back on me, saying I was being selfish,” she remembers, with pain that still seems fresh. “So I also had to grieve the loss of the parents, and I had never experienced that before.” Barb, who carried Simmie, is a devout churchgoer who had initially tried to decline payment. She relented in the face of Melissa’s insistence. After spending some of it on a family trip to Disneyland, she says she gave a lot of the money away. “I’m not money-driven, and I didn’t want it,” she remarks. “Or I shouldn’t say I didn’t want it—but I felt that that was taking away from the gift of helping other people. So we donated to the church, we sponsored kids at camp, that kind of stuff.” The intentional parents on the other end of surrogacy transactions are a diverse group. They are women born with uterine abnormalities, survivors of cancer treatments that have impaired their ability to reproduce, and women who have endured miscarriage after miscarriage. Some are high-powered professionals who have put off procreation until an age, when, for many, it is too late. In recent years, the rise of gay-marriage equality has dramatically expanded the number of gay men who turn to gestational surrogacy to have children. Foreign nationals are another growing segment of the marketplace. The United States (depending on the state) is one of a very small handful of countries where commercial surrogacy is permitted. Many countries prohibit altruistic surrogacy as well. Laws vary. In Israel, a state-appointed committee reviews contracts on a case-by-case basis—but has heretofore declined to approve any arrangement involving homosexual or inter-religious couples. Gay Israelis have been a substantial part of Brisman’s client mix. Chinese nationals form another significant segment; using an American gestational surrogate enables them to select the sex of a child, and to endow that child with US citizenship, by dint of his or her (usually his) birth on American soil. The unifying characteristic of all these people is wealth. Even in cases when Brisman provides her services free of charge (either through charity organizations like the Gay Parenting Assistance Program, or for people whose hardship has pulled her heartstrings), medical costs and the carrier’s compensation make gestational surrogacy available to a small, very affluent minority. And therein lies one of the trickiest aspects of the surrogacy business. The economic and social gulf separating intentional parents from the surrogates bearing their children is so wide, it effectively defines entirely different worlds. With nearly every arrangement she makes, Brisman has to bridge that divide—a challenge that casts contemporary inequality in a fascinating light. When Brisman mentioned testing the water in the homes of prospective carriers, I couldn’t help wonder why. American tap water is abundantly regulated and hasn’t been a serious public health issue in decades—though natural-gas fracking has made it a concern in some areas, including parts of Pennsylvania where some of Brisman’s carriers live. “Are people drinking unsafe water?” I ask. “No, but it’s an obsession of our clients,” she replies. Some clients arrange to have bottled water shipped to their carrier’s homes during the duration of the pregnancy. Others fixate on their carrier’s diet. Or her cookware. “So they do things like, they want organic food, so they ship it,” Brisman says. “We had a client who shipped food, got her a chef in the house, and got her all new pots because she didn’t like the idea that she had pots that were Teflon.” She recalls one couple who insisted on restricting their carrier from taking her kids to archery practice, and another that insisted on flying their carrier to doctor appointments in a private jet—despite how unnerving it was for her to be the only person aboard a flight whose cost she could barely stand to think about. “We once had a client who wanted the carrier to have organic makeup, which I had never heard of,” Brisman goes on. “Health and beauty products that were completely, like, free of chemicals. So she offered to get her an account at some fancy department store where she could buy all her health and beauty products. “And I was pretty afraid, actually, to call her up and ask her.” Maligning a woman’s makeup is, to put it mildly, a delicate business. “But the carrier loved it. She was so happy … buying all kinds of fancy shampoos.” “Some of the carriers won’t have it,” Brisman says. “They will say, ‘No, I’m not doing that, get somebody else. This is crazy.’” In practice, it often falls to a carrier to decide whom she’s willing to carry a baby for. A surrogate unwilling to abort a fetus with a congenital anomaly, for example, would obviously be a bad match for intended parents who want to keep the option of abortion open. (Conversely, a surrogate’s right to terminate a pregnancy is constitutionally protected, though a carrier who chose to could expect a tussle over her financial compensation, which is paid out over the course of the pregnancy.) Sometimes surrogates simply get a bad feeling about how committed a couple is to a potential child, or how committed they are to one another. A surrogate might also refuse to carry a baby for a gay couple, or a Jewish one, or a couple she deems too old to parent new children. The 50 or so fertility clinics Brisman works with have their own requirements for intended parents, which may include psychological evaluations and age cutoffs. But as long as clinics don’t turn up any red flags, Brisman mostly tries to reserve judgment. “When I started doing this, the only people that I helped were 100 percent in need of a carrier—they’d lost their uterus, had cancer, had six miscarriages. Now sometimes it blurs the line,” she says. “Fifteen years ago, you were gay, or a heterosexual and couldn’t carry the baby. You weren’t 42 years old and didn’t want to carry the baby, which I find to be much harder of a call. Sometimes it’s hard to keep your personal view out of it. We might have somebody who has perfectly healthy twins, but only wants one baby, and they might reduce. And I have to reserve judgment. So that’s hard … I have twins, you know. So sometimes it’s been hard to see things that I don’t think, personally, should be done. But as a lawyer, you can’t judge people. And I’ve had to really come to terms with being able to see all the sides.” The intended parents and carriers I spoke with mostly described positive relationships. But any number of things can sour the rapport. “I had a carrier who covered her face in the delivery because she didn’t want to see the intended parents,” Brisman recalls. “She was just so pissed at them.” Brisman credits one of her employees with helping intended parents and carriers see more eye-to-eye. But her own upbringing has undoubtedly played an important role too. “I think it would be harder if I didn’t have all sorts of people in my neighborhood, growing up,” she says. “People who are well-off and well-educated often come from people who are well-off and well-educated. And a lot of times, they just don’t know how to treat somebody else who isn’t. And it’s not necessarily vindictive or conceited. It’s just the inability to relate to somebody who grew up differently, because they haven’t been around it. “There are other intended parents who feel like it’s almost a right,” she continues. “Like they’re paying this woman $25,000, so she has to do whatever they say. And they don’t recognize that it’s not that much money, and [what she’s doing is] a huge gift, and you have to treat her like a person. “More than a lawyer, sometimes I’m a personality coach,” she concludes. “Like, you have to treat people like you would want to be treated. You would think that you wouldn’t have to tell somebody that, but you really do.” By the time the Brismans embarked on their own second surrogate pregnancy, Melissa had internalized at least some of the advice she gives her clients. “Barb knew that I was a nervous person,” she recalls. “And so she would email or text me every morning: ‘I’m awake, I’m alive, I’m fine.” Barb characterizes their relationship as sisterly, despite a pregnancy marked by a worrisome buildup of excess amniotic fluid. She also has a vivid memory from immediately after her delivery, as Simmie was being evaluated and cleaned by the obstetric team. “Dan went over to Simmie, and Melissa was still by my side,” she recalls. “And I said, ‘Melissa, go to your baby!’ And she said, ‘I don’t want to leave you alone.’ “Here’s this person who can’t have kids, who went to this expense to have kids,” Barb marvels. “And I think that goes to show the bond that we had. I think it speaks volumes of the relationship you can have, if both parties want it. “It’s one of those things I’ll never forget, because it was one of the most defining acts of kindness that I’ve experienced.”   Carrying a child for a woman who can’t carry her own is a profoundly humane act. It is also a deeply controversial one. Periodically Brisman debates bioethicist Art Caplan, the founding director of Penn’s Center For Bioethics (who departed in 2012 after 18 years), on TV. Caplan opposes commercial surrogacy on the grounds that it exploits women, whose “only motive for being a paid surrogate is poverty,” as he wrote last year in The New York Times. Like many critics (and some proponents) of surrogacy, he is especially wary of “reproductive tourism” in developing nations like India, where surrogates come cheap and exploitation has been documented. “He makes the case that we shouldn’t be able to sell a part of our body,” says Brisman, who has limited her business to American carriers. “But in my mind, you do that in almost every laboring profession, right? So he says there’s a risk you’re going to die giving birth. Well, should we not have people work in coalmines? More people die in coalmines, digging coal, than they do giving birth. Should we tell people they can’t play football for a profit, because they might get a head injury? Somehow, when you get a woman involved, all of a sudden they can’t consent. But men can consent to all these dangerous activities. “I think the real problem is that there needs to be education,” Brisman continues. “When a surrogate comes to me, I educate her:  You could die giving birth; this many people die giving birth. You know, we’re going to get you life insurance. You could have a stroke. This is why we don’t want you to carry triplets, because it is dangerous. And even though most of the danger is to the babies, the danger is to you, too.  So a lot of it is in the education. When you don’t regulate it, that’s a big problem.” Some legal scholars have leveled a different objection to commercial surrogacy: that the parental privacy rights pertaining to a child in a woman’s womb are inalienable. In the wake of the Baby M case, Anita Allen, the Henry R. Silverman Professor of Law and a current member of the Presidential Bioethics Commission, argued that “freedom of contract should not include the freedom to bargain away certain constitutional rights,” and that “constitutional privacy prohibits the validation and enforcement of irrevocable surrogacy agreements.” “[C]hildless men and couples do not have privacy rights that entitle them to state enforcement of surrogacy agreements,” she concluded, whereas “would-be surrogate mothers have constitutional privacy rights so strong as to limit their own capacities for alienating their procreative and traditional parental prerogatives.” Yet the rise of gestational surrogacy has at the very least complicated that line of reasoning. Couples who use their own gametes to create an embryo can be seen to have some parental privacy rights inherent in it, even if the embryo is nurtured in another woman’s womb. It also bears noting that all of the carriers with whom I spoke emphasized a certain feeling of disconnection from the fetuses they carried, arising from the knowledge that they were genetically unrelated. “It’s like if you babysit someone’s child,” Barb remarks. “You don’t think of keeping it. I knew, going into it, this was their baby, 100 percent biologically. So I went into it with a different state of mind.” But even that notion—that a genetic relationship outweighs the biological connection forged through the womb—is heavily influenced by culture. Indeed, the Brismans discovered as much for themselves when they went to arrange a bris for their twins. “The rabbi was so excited by how we had the kids,” Dan recalls. “He thought it was such a wonderful, great thing, and it was why he was going to call his elders, his people in Israel, to discuss it. “So he calls us back, and he tells us he spoke to his elders, and this is wonderful. We’re going to have the bris, and we’ll also be doing the conversion. I said, ‘What are you talking about, the conversion?’ Well, in his mind—and in the elders’ minds, I guess—the boys, since they were born from someone that was not Jewish, had to be converted.” “The oven was unkosher,” Melissa chimes in. “That’s what he told us.” They found another rabbi. But there’s clearly more than one way to evaluate the relative importance of nature and nurture when it comes to gestational surrogacy. And though there is no disputing the powerful role of genes, the intrauterine environment’s influence on a child’s future health and well-being is also well-established—and may well be increasingly appreciated as the science of epigenetics advances. Its importance surely accounts for many of the anxieties intended parents have about their carriers’ diets and lifestyles. Whatever your view, gestational surrogacy has become a far more accepted practice over the past 15 years, and Brisman has played a big role in its expansion on the East Coast. “This is a big business now,” she reflects. “But when I did this, I didn’t do this to make a big business. I mean, it grew, and I’m happy about it. But I think in some sense if you do what you love, it will grow. And I loved helping other people do what I did.” Debates about what, if any, limits should be placed on it will probably continue to reflect the mores of a society that doesn’t restrict ordinary parenthood at all. You may need a license to drive, as the old observation goes, but all it takes to create a child is the biological capacity to do so. In one sense, gestational surrogacy simply extends that weighty liberty to a wider circle. The universal hope is that that every newborn child will extend blessings further still. After she bore Simmie Brisman, Barb went on to carry once more, for a different couple. The memory that stuck with her in the wake of that surrogacy was of encountering the intended mother’s own mom. “She came up to me and said, ‘I just want to thank you. You know, when Amy had her diagnosis as a teenager, I never thought I’d be a grandmom.’ And it was at that point that I thought, ‘Man, this isn’t just about Melissa and Dan, or Amy and Matt. This is aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents.’ And that just made me fall in love with the idea all the more. It’s not just a nuclear unit. It’s about the entire family.” a beautiful article about a beautiful woman. and the kudos bestowed on her and the benovelence she has bestowed is even 2 thousand times as great. Sincerely, Victor This is an great article about an even more amazing woman. She has so much passion for what she does and truly gets a joy out of helping couples that cannot conceive or carry their own baby for whatever reasons and helps their dreams come true.
Melissa embodies what a strong perseverant woman is. She would not take no for an answer and in turn became a very successful business woman as well as a great wife, mother and friend!! What a beautifully written article!  It’s great to see someone so passionate about life (literally) and pursuing a career in something in which they believe so strongly.  I’m sure there were more lucrative careers for a Wharton and Harvard Law School grad, but if more people followed their passions like Melissa, the world would be a better, and happier, place. Wonderful article about some very important issues.  Melissa Brisman is truly a pioneer in this field and has helped directly and indirectly thousands of people to conceive children who would not have been able to without using a gestational carrier.  Her intelligence, passion, creativity and experience have made this very high tech and complicated process a reality for so many and helped those of us in the field approach these pregnancies in a way that makes sense legally and logistically.  I have learned a tremendous amount from working with Melissa for the last decade and it has been a real privilege and always a learning experience.  Thanks so much to Melissa for sharing her own personal story and experiences and to Trey Popp for writing them all down!  Serena H Chen MD, IRMS at Saint Barnabas, Livingston, NJ http://www.sbivf.com What a great article!  Melissa has done so much to change the lives of so many and make their dreams come true.  Working in the industry has given me insight into what she has also done on a global scale.  She has influenced policy, driven the rights of all types of families forward and has educated individuals and couples worldwide, helping to remove the stigma of the gestational carrier experience.  Thank you for featuring Melissa in the Gazette. As a fellow attorney and colleague of Melissa, I can attest to the incredible joy her intended parents feel when they finally have the family they’ve so longed for.  Melissa brings unmatched expertise and enthusiasm to her clients and continues to push the envelope on broader reproductive rights issues.  This article illuminates the personal side of her and Dan’s struggles and artfully weaves the personal and professional story together. What a wonderful article about a very deserving woman and a good friend. You have accomplished so much! I am so proud for you, Melissa!  Keep up the wonderful work you are doing; I am sure many, many families are very thankful! You’re an amazing lady Melissa!!! Inspiring.

[Photo Credit: SockPuppetBC] Her brain is filled with more knowledge than you’re capable of consuming. 

 
[Photo Credit: Giphy]Hunter earned her degree in Modern Languages at Oxford University, where she concentrated on French and Italian. From there, she moved to Paris to study avante-garde theater at L’École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq, before moving to New York to train at the Saratoga International Theatre Institute.

Apparenty, the "BBHMM" songstress completely adores her ex-boyfriend's little girl. But the 26-year-old hip-hop superstar must now deal with nonstop drama involving baby mama Nia Guzman, and such frustration is driving him to tears. Will this ultimately ruin his rekindled friendship with the 27-year-old Barbadian beauty?  Like Us on Facebook   Apparently, Guzman rarely lets Brown visit Royalty anymore since the former flings are currently going through the process of a vicious custody battle. Still, the "Loyal" crooner tries to talk to his firstborn whenever possible, usually by phone. But when he finally got connected via FaceTime on Tuesday (August 18), Guzman was not too pleased: "Right off the bat, Nia was upset," an alleged insider tells the popular gossip webloid HollywoodLife.com. After 40 minutes of struggle, supposedly Guzman just put Royalty down for a nap when Breezy called. The sound woke her up, and Guzman was extremely peeved: "Nia told Chris 'This is not a good time, dude. You just woke her up and she's crying,'" the snitch reveals. Brown was very understanding and said, "I'm sorry. How was I supposed to know that? But since she's up, give her the phone. I want to sing this rhyme I made for her. It will put her back to sleep." Sweet, right? But Guzman wouldn't allow it. Before hanging-up she explained that both mommy and baby were too exhausted and needed to sleep - pronto. The "Ayo" singer tried calling back later, but was immediately sent to voicemail. Now he's totally heartbroken, and can't help missing the only important female currently in his life. Hopefully Guzman will change her mind, seeing how miserable this entire situation makes Brown: "He was hurt," the source concludes. "He cried. It was just painful for him to hear Royalty crying and knowing he couldn't do anything to calm her down... He really wishes Nia could see how much she's ripping his heart out by withholding his FaceTime sessions with Royalty." Will Breezy eventually lean on Rih for support again? Meanwhile, Brown must continue focusing on his upcoming "One Hell of a Nite" tour. RELATED: Rihanna Stressed, Chris Brown Boyfriend Drama Prompts Album Delay?

(Twitter) Liza Morales is the longtime ex-girlfriend of Lamar Odom and mother to his children. Read on for the facts on Morales and her kids with Odom below. Have a look at the best Instagram photos of Lamar Odom's children. His kids are Destiny and Lamar Jr., along with his baby Jayden who died of SIDS. In an open letter, Morales talked about when she first met and started dating Odom. Morales wrote:  I met Lamar in the 9th grade in Queens, New York, and was completely taken in by his wit, charm, and that devastating smile he so easily flashed at anyone he met. We dated from the 11th grade on and shared a tight bond due to a lot of things, including the fact that we both were products of broken homes. Joe Odom is the father of Lamar. Read on for the sad details on Lamar's dad, his late mother, and his family.  My family. ❤ @itskhloeodom @itslamodom @LJODOM A photo posted by Destiny Odom (@destiinyodom) on Mar 5, 2013 at 1:39pm PST Morales and Odom have a daughter named Destiny and a son named Lamar Odom Jr., after his dad. Keeping Up With the Kardashians fans have seen Odom’s children on his spin-off show Khloe & Lamar. In addition, they have walked the red carpet with their father and ex-step-mother Khloe Kardashian. Their children live with Morales in New York City. Odom and Morales had another child together, who died from SIDS as a baby in 2006. His name was Jayden. Morales opened up about the death to The Daily Beast, saying:  Lamar and I never really talked about our loss, which I know wasn’t healthy and also meant our relationship would never last. It couldn’t. I found out soon after that he’d had a long-term relationship with another woman—a relationship he said he’d end but he didn’t—and that was that. Destiny Odom is the daughter of Lamar Odom and Liza Morales. Have a look at her best Instagram photos. Morales has been a star on the show Starter Wives, which aired on the TLC network and then moved to just be shown on the TLC website. Exes of Rappers 50 Cent, DMX and fighter Floyd Mayweather all appeared on the show. Morales told The Daily Beast about why she decided to do the show, explaining:  Though some frown upon my decision to do a reality show, I agreed to be a part of “Starter Wives” so I could tell my own story of how things unfolded after Lamar married Khloe. We weren’t really together so I didn’t fall apart as many have suggested. I’ve have to deal with a lot of tabloid lies as the result of all the attention Lamar gets since he’s married to someone so famous. She continued: To be honest I’m really doing the show for my daughter to prove to her that you can get up and move on after things fall apart. I did it to show her how you make mistakes and fix them and that you can never give up on yourself. She needed to see that and hear it from me. I think I also hope my father sees it as well. The only time I’ve seen my dad in recent years was at the funeral for my son. Morales said that Lamar Odom wasn’t very happy about her doing the show. Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom's relationship has been on display for years. Their divorce, the cheating allegations, the drugs, and more have plagued them.  Obsessed with this photo @itskhloeodom A photo posted by Destiny Odom (@destiinyodom) on Feb 10, 2013 at 2:29pm PST Morales posted an open letter online when she talked about Lamar’s telling her he was getting married. Morales wrote:  I don’t think I’ll forget the tight knot I felt in the pit of my stomach the morning I received the text message with three simple words on the screen. It read “I’m getting married” and it was from the man I’d spent more than 10 years of my life with. Years that included us getting engaged in 2000 and becoming parents to one daughter and two sons. Yet not long after our separation Lamar Odom was getting married to Khloe Kardashian, a woman he’d met four weeks before. How could the man who’d constantly given me reason after reason for why we couldn’t get married just yet now be ready to tie the knot so quickly? There aren’t words to explain how I felt that day.

 Well, this is one way to get a message to your ex-wife. During the third quarter of the Super Bowl, actor Taye Diggs made it clear what he was watching: ex-wife Idina Menzel's national anthem performance. See more Super Bowl 2015: Watch the Commercials Alongside the message, the accompanying photo of his TV screen also appeared to show the former couple's son, Walter, watching mom's big moment. Seems like Diggs is really taking that "let it go" mantra to heart. Yup. Baby mama crushed it at the Super Bowl. pic.twitter.com/94Vs8trhuD Menzel wasn't the only Super Bowl performer to get an online shout-out from an ex. Earlier on Sunday, halftime headliner Katy Perry also got some good vibes sent her way from her ex-husband Russell Brand. A version of this post originally appeared on Billboard.com.

BFF Claims Jenner REALLY Knew About Nicole Brown's Murder In Tell-All Kenya Moore Reveals Gossip About Kim Fields' Husband Liberty Ross Remarries After Ex-Husband's Infamous Affair With Kristen Stewart Getting Cozy: Gwen Stefani Sits In Blake Shelton's Lap For Pre-Grammy Party Kanye West's Longtime Co-Writer Quits & Begs Rapper To Seek Mental Help The music world was rocked by the shocking news this week that legally-troubled singer Chris Brown is now the father of a 9-month-old baby girl. But one person was more overwhelmed than most: baby mama Nia Amey‘s ex-husband, who RadarOnline.com has learned divorced Brown’s baby mama after he found out about the affair! “It ain’t going to take a rocket science to figure that out. I got a divorce because Nia got pregnant by someone else,” Terry Amey told Radar. Divorce documents obtained by Radar reveal that the Ameys married in January 2003, and “ceased to live together as husband and wife on or about January 2014.” The divorce documents claimed that Nia was “pregnant at the time of filing” but Terry denied paternity and requested a DNA test. She gave birth to her child by Brown that summer. READ THE DIVORCE DOCUMENTS “It might be a shock to the world being that Chris Brown is a father and now he’s going to have to step up to do right thing,” Terry told Radar. “But at the same time I’m a god-loving person and I have to forgive to give my message.” And the message he wants to make clear is that his ex is not who the world thinks. “She was young and she had obstacles and made mistakes and now you have a child involved,” he said. “Social media is making it worse than what it is. But nobody is perfect,” he continued. “When you’re in this industry all types of things are going to happen. It’s not just happening with my ex wife – it’s all women in the industry. When you allow persuasion and [being] misled to guide you, things are going to happen. It is what it is. It’s a part of growing. PHOTOS: Sowing Their Celebrity Oats! 15 Famous Dads Who Have Plenty Of Kids… And Baby Mamas! “Social media is saying this and that and that she’s a gold digger. … Nia is not the person who they portray. She has a past, but who don’t have one [sic]. She knew whose that baby was, so that name ‘Royalty’ came [about] because she will be royalty.” Terry and Nia also have a 13-year-old daughter, Zillah, who he wants to keep out of the headlines. “I’m upset social media is blowing this up and two kids are involved and they’re young,” said Terry. But meanwhile, Nia is “a great mother,” he insisted. “She’s been raising Zillah and Royalty” with the help of her own mother. PHOTOS: Baby Mama Drama! The 14 Wildest Celebrity Mothers But Terry wants the girls’ dads to have a role too, and so he’s asking Brown to consent to a man-to-man talk. “We are going to have a sit-down. Terry Amey and Chris Brown are going to have a sit-down because we’re sharing daughters,” he said. “I never met the man before — the only thing is what I see on TV. I might not be nothing to him because I’m not in music, but I am somebody. We are going to have a talk.” “I’m not worried about Chris’ past,” he continued. “I’m worried about his future. That’s Zillah’s sister. We need to raise these girls. We will have a time because we share something that’s valuable to us — our little girls.” “And the end of the day there are two parents involved – him, me and the baby mama — and somewhere along the line we going to have a sit-down and an understanding,” he insisted. PHOTOS: Meet The Parents! Hollywood’s Best & Worst Moms And Dads Terry says that despite the media publicity surrounding the birth, and celebrity connection, he still has a good relationship with his ex-wife. And he hopes to amicably co-parent with Chris, even though he says the R&B star’s fling with his wife broke up his marriage. “My life does goes on. The baby being here and a baby taking nine months, I knew about the child. I did visit with the baby,” said Terry. “I thought I could have been the baby daddy. …” he added. But now that the truth is out, he said, “I’m not going to let this Chris Brown thing discourage me. I’m on their team, even up until today. She’s driving my car to take Chris’s baby around places and to the doctor. I’m still here.”  6 things to know about Louis Tomlinson’s baby mama Sign Up / Sign In Sign In // Sign Up Sign Up / Sign In Sign In // Sign Up Sign Up / Sign In Sign In // Sign Up Almost Done!

 July 15, 2015 | 2:21pm Meet Briana Jungwirth, the woman expecting a baby with @OneDirection's @Louis_Tomlinson http://t.co/h5KKsPMDSg pic.twitter.com/qRgCX5CDgR — People magazine (@people) July 14, 2015  There is something bigger than One Direction these days: Louis Tomlinson’s baby bombshell. As People reports, the 23-year-old boybander is expecting his first child with gal pal Briana Jungwirth. A close friend of the pair claims they are “very excited” to welcome the new arrival. While Tomlinson is one of the most highly publicized singers in the world, Jungwirth is relatively unknown — until now, that is. Before we meet the duo’s bundle of joy, let’s get acquainted with Mom first. 1 The 23-year-old currently works as a stylist in Los Angeles, where she assists on fashion shoots. Though she doesn’t boast Rachel Zoe’s Rolodex, Jungwirth was rumored to be employed by, you guessed it, One Direction. 2 Unlike Tomlinson’s ex-girlfriend, Eleanor Calder, Jungwirth was born and raised in the US of A. Still no word where the two will raise their tot. 3 Though Tomlinson is a certified serial tweeter, Jungwirth certainly is not. In fact, the mom-to-be doesn’t have public Twitter, Facebook or Instagram accounts. 4 After splitting with Calder in March, it didn’t take long for Tomlinson to re-emerge with a new lady on his arm. The One Directioner met Jungwirth through mutual friends in May, before taking her out on several dates in LA. 5 Tomlinson and Jungwirth will forever be linked once their child is born, but that doesn’t mean the singer will be popping the question anytime soon. As a pal tells People, “He and Briana are very, very close friends and this [the pregnancy] has brought them even closer.” 6 Jungwirth has a reputation for being “very private,” so chances are she’ll spend the next nine months quietly.

												 Chris Brown can finally focus on raising his 1-year-old daughter, Royalty. On Monday, Brown, 26, and the mother of his daughter, Nia Guzman, reached joint legal and physical custody agreements, according to TMZ. “Court went great today,” Brown tweeted of the news. “Glad this all worked out.” As per their new agreement, Royalty’s last name will officially be Brown. The R&B singer will get 12 days a month with his daughter without supervision. And for the finances, Brown will dole out $2,500 every month to Guzman. He will also be financially responsible for the kid’s education expenses, insurance, medical bills and childcare. Brown also took a drug test during the custody battle. He turned up positive for marijuana and codeine — both of which he has prescriptions for.  The QUEEN!👑 A photo posted by @chrisbrownofficial on Aug 23, 2015 at 11:10pm PDT

 Lamar Odom’s Baby Mama Liza Morales Sends Inspiring Tweet After His Hospitalization Latest Fashion News: Latest Fashion Photos: Latest Beauty News: Latest Beauty Photos: Lamar Odom’s ex, longtime girlfriend Liza Morales, is too struggling with the devastating news about her former love. While Lamar remains in the hospital, Liza is sending her love to the father of her children. More Lamar Odom News:      Photos Coming soon. Photos Coming soon. Liza Morales, 36, took to Twitter on October 14 to share her grief and admiration for Lamar Odom, 35, after he was rushed to the hospital with dire complications from an alleged overdose. The father of her kids, and once her longtime love, Lamar is deep within Liza’s thoughts at this time.    Khloe & Lamar ~ Season 2 (2 Disc Set) (PAL) (REGION 2 & 4)   Liza posted an image of Tupac Shakur on Twitter, complete with a quote from the inspiring, uplifting rapper. “You see you wouldn’t ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had damaged petals. On the contrary, we would all celebrate its tenacity. We would all love its will to reach the sun. Well; we are the roses, this is the concrete, and these are my damaged petals.” She clearly had Lamar on her mind when posting this. Liza doesn’t post to Twitter very often (her last tweet before this was on August 14), but she reached out on a tragic, terrible day to share something beautiful about someone misunderstood, in need of love. Like many of Lamar’s other loved ones — LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Caitlyn Jenner — Liza is defending Lamar from those judging his alleged drug usage. Per the quote, Lamar has had an incredibly difficult life, and he’s come out rough around the edges because of his struggles. He shouldn’t be disparaged; he should be supported for trying to survive. pic.twitter.com/yo9hKCIbjx — Liza M (@TruLiza4u) October 14, 2015  Liza has shared much of this heartbreak with Lamar. Their six-month-old baby, Jayden, died in 2006 due to SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome). It’s a heartbreak no parent could ever forget, and a bond that Liza and Lamar will always share. The two are also parents to Destiny and Lamar Jr. Liza and Lamar may not be together, but there is definitely love and devotion abound. Our thoughts remain with Lamar and his loved ones at this time. — Samantha Wilson  The Best Backstage Fall '16 Shoe Shots At New York Fashion Week TVLine Items: Hutcherson to Hulu, S.H.I.E.L.D.

As we reported, Chris Brown is supposedly the father of a 9-month-old baby girl… And the mother is 31-year-old model Nia Gonzalez. Well, just exactly who is the woman at the center of the controversy? Here's what we know so far:  1. She also goes by Nia Amey and is originally from Texas.  2. In addition to modeling, she's a nursing student.  3. She has several photos posted on ModelMayhem.com.  4. Gonzales has also appeared in several music videos including Phill Wade's Dreams of You.  5. Her and Chris have known each other for years and are NOT in a relationship.  6. They were rumored to be sleeping together in the summer of 2013, which is when the baby would have been conceived.  7. She partied with Chris Brown's now ex Karrueche Tran in May 2013 in Las Vegas. There are even Instagram photos of them circulating. Unfortunately, Karreuche had NO idea Nia and Chris were hooking up. Here is one where Tran actually has her arm around Nia:  S/O them They always #STAYTRU !! @msblairr #SexiiNia @christinamilian @karrueche @karizma22 A photo posted by Kid Red (@kidred) on May 26, 2013 at 5:37pm PDT  And here is one of Chris at the same party:  If you ain't freakin, We ain't Speakin A photo posted by Kid Red (@kidred) on May 26, 2013 at 4:58pm PDT   8.

Everyone's been wondering if Kanye West is the next Amanda Bynes of Twitter... but it seems like those close to him aren't too concerned. A longtime pal of the rapper told People: "I haven't felt personally concerned about his well being. Every time I talk with him – which is almost every day – he's extremely good-natured, [and] in a great mood." Concerns for the fashion designer's mental health stemmed from two separate interviews with former collaborators, Rhymefest and Malik Yusef, who both expressed being worried at the Grammys on Monday. Related: Kanye West Goes On ANOTHER Twitter Rant However, the source is suspicious of their motives: "I personally don't feel that the Grammys red carpet is an appropriate place to express concern for the 'health of your friend.' All those guys do is talk about Kanye. There can be all types of motivations there. Both of those guys are extremely talented, don't get me wrong, but for years [they've] been talking about Kanye in the press." Fair enough. As you could probably guess, it's no coincidence all this attention is coming at the same time as Ye's launch of his album The Life of Pablo and Yeezy Season 3. The insider shared:

Via TMZ: Chief Keef — prodigy rapper, horrible parent — finally paid off some of the $20,900 he owes in child support … ponying up JUST enough cash to keep his ass from getting arrested … again. TMZ has obtained court docs which show on October 21st, the judge in Cook County, IL made Keef an offer he couldn’t refuse — cut a check for $11k to your baby mama and you won’t go to jail. Keef (smartly) forked over the dough … which means cops won’t be ordered to arrest him on sight. But Keef ain’t exactly out of the woods yet — the rapper is due back in court on December 10 to face the music for blowing off mandatory child support hearings earlier this year. If the judge finds Keef to be in contempt, he could be sent back to the slammer … where he’s already been this year (twice!) for drug-related offenses. Here is a photo of Keef’s first baby mama and daughter. Yes, he has impregnated two other women as well…   Well, it looks like Keef’s other, other baby mama finally got her child support check because she recently posted this photo on her IG:  Really? We just hope Sosa’s daughter is getting a piece of that child support check before he mama spends it all on a new toy. Hit the flip for more… Reblogged this on Servin' Up The Tea and commented:
Smh I’m so confused…. why did she feel the need to post the check again?  A ghetto mess! […] Read More […] […] Chief Keef has more baby mama than hit songs!

 TMZ Live: Paul McCartney: Music Legend REJECTED at Grammy After-Party Kanye West Shopping at Jacob & Co.  Chris Brown is chomping at the bit to face his baby mama in custody court ... and the biggest weapon in his arsenal is the woman's boyfriend.  Chris and Nia Guzman will fight it out in 2 weeks. She wants full custody of 1-year-old Royalty and visitation for Chris, BUT only if it's monitored. She says he's a bad guy who hangs with criminals and smokes weed. Chris wants joint custody.  But we're told Chris thinks her argument will boomerang right back in her face, because her boyfriend, King Ba -- the guy who lived with her and is even named on Royalty's birth certificate -- is a wanted man ... on the run for felony forgery.  We're told Chris is eager to tell the judge Nia has terrible judgment ... hooking up with a con man. As we first reported, Chris believes Nia's real motivation has nothing to do with custody ... she wants to squeeze more child support out of him. He's currently paying $2,500. She wants $15k. As for Nia, her rep tells us, she's no longer with King Ba.   HERE'S THE RUNDOWN The Weeknd's Big Night Ended Face-to-Face with Police Kaley Cuoco May Have a New Man: Sam Hunt!

 Manny Pacquiao Wearing Nike   Ex-NBA superstar Gilbert Arenas UNLEASHED on his baby mama Laura Govan -- claiming she blows the $20k he gives her every month on clothes for Instagram "for u f*cks to hit the like button." Arenas is LIVID -- and clearly blames Laura for negative stories about him in the media ... in which he feels he's painted as a deadbeat dad to their 4 young children.  Enter Gilbert on social media last night ... putting Laura right in the crosshairs.  "I always read about what kind of dad I am but I've never posted about it so who's telling yall? let me guess the mother RIGHT im a Deadbeat??" In his rant, Gilbert says he's set up each of his kids with a $300k college fund, plus he pays for everything from private school to food, clothes, house, cars, etc.  Then he goes after Laura -- "She gets 20k a month but if u read what I do then ask urself what does she do with 20k ...she has to feed the kids at home, pay for gas to get them to school and pay her phone bill andddddddd that's it." He added, "She gets 20k to buy her self clothes for #IG for u f*cks to hit the like button." "She has 2 million dollar closet but my kids look like their bums half the damn time they get posted and I'm the #Deadbeat....if I'm a #deadbeat and a bad father WHAT the f*ck are the rest of the fathers called??? Yall can call me what u want but i bet yall want me as ur baby daddy smdh." The fight between these two is clearly nasty -- with Laura having previously asked a judge for a restraining order against Gilbert, though her request was shot down.
