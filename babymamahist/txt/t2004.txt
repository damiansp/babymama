Anderson Coats (aka nilliaj) A Good Mom by Elizabeth Cunningham-Halbert When I was Garbage by Allison Crews Reclaiming my sexuality by Ella Legal Emergency? A Guide to Fast Action Community Advocacy and Support by and for Young Mothers  I just recently had my baby (a beautiful 8 lb boy named Indigo) and for the most part things have been going well. The only thing I've been struggling with is this sense that I don't really know who I am anymore.  I don't have time for myself or to do any of the things that excited me before, and in all of that I've kind of lost touch with myself.  Less than two years ago I didn't care about anyone--I was a single girl heading off to college and just wanted to have a little fun.   But I fell in love and made a baby.  And here I am, a full time mom and wife-to-be.  I haven't even had a chance to catch my breath.  I think about my identity, the traits that describe me, and I'm not even sure any of that applies to me anymore.  I'm not the same person I was two years ago.  And I don't have any time to figure out who am I now.   Sometimes I feel like I've been erased.  Like I'm kind of a shell of my former self.  and really, it's a little alarming. So to mothers out there....I know it gets better as your baby gets older and more independent, but in the mean time...how did you get through those first few months?  how did you maintain sanity?  has anyone else experienced this sense of having lost themselves? i guess i kinda went through that too for a little bit.  you can still be yourself and be a mom!  i didn't let me from having a child at a young age stop me from doing what i want to do or being who i want to be!  of course, i don't go out as much, but more then likely i would rather just sit at home and watch finding nemo with my daughter.  yes it si rather shocking to become a mother and when i first did i always would think, "Me Heather a MOM???"  but after a while i realized that all of it is totally worth ti and totally meant to happen.  just look at your child and realize how much they he loves you and how much he trusts you.  just wait until he can start to walk and when you come home, he runs up to you screaming "MOMMY!!!  MOMMY'S HOME!!  I LOVE MY MOMMY!"  i think the rest of it just melts away...
but still be who you are, still do the things you wanna do... 
i still go to protests, still go out & mobilize and sometimes bring my daugther with...
don't worry... :D First, figure out what made your identity and why it can't any longer.  Everyone has different hobbies, but when I first became a mother, music was a serious passion and when my daughter was little, I still listened to it and I felt the same.
Find those traits that you once used to describe yourself nd live them out, enhance them. I totally went through all that! After BD, Riley and I had an apartment, I totally lost who I was. I ended up moving out with Riley, for awhile to find myself, and yea after that was when the beating and raped happened and we wont get into that. I just wanted you to know that I have been there! If you need to talk you can PM me. I think a lot has to do with the early months of your baby's life.  Newborns are so, so labor intensive, lol.  Their needs are just so immediate and all encompassing, it's hard to do anything else or think about much else.  It is normal to feel overwhelmed and overworked.  Are you able to take time for yourself each day, like a hot shower or bath while someone cares for your baby?  This can be amazing for helping you recoup and just have time to think. Get some good novels or non-fiction books on a subject you are interested in and read some while your baby nurses/naps/sits next to you checking things out.  But nap when baby does if you need to!  Can you put baby in a sling or stroller and get out for a walk every day or so?  If you feel ok leaving him with someone else, go out to the bookstore or for a cup of coffee or tea at the coffee shop for an hour or so.   Can you take a course at your local college, maybe a night course?  Or a correspondance course?  I've taken several online courses since my little ones were born and this really helps me to feel like I'm doing something for me.  I also read as much as possible because it gives me a deep sense of satisfaction to learn about whatever I'm interested in at the time, and I love to read.  My librarian has ceased to be suprised when I check out books on Japanese, pioneer life, gardening, and car repair all in one trip) haha.  If there is a hobby you were passionate about before your baby was born, can you take that back up?  My true love is technical theatre, and those long, irregular hours are (for me) not at all compatible with caring for my children.   So even though I don't work in university/professional theatre anymore, I still try to do community theatre where it's much more relaxed.   It just takes time to work out how to do the things you love with your child.  But it will come.  The early months are about learning to balance.  But I think it's totally possible to be an awesome mama (and partner) and continue to take care of yourself, enjoy your hobbies, and learn and grow in ways that you want to.   Geez I got rambly, hopefully this was helpful, hah! i remember feeling stressed out by all the new roles i had to play after my son was born as well.  i went from just a girl doing her thing, to someone's mother, someone's babymama, someone's partner, etc.  it can be overwhelming to have all of those roles, that seem so huge, come onto you at once.   but it gets easier, i promise.  even though my son is 3 now, occasionally i still have moments where i can't BELIEVE i'm someone's mother.  or where the stress of being a mom seems like its too much, and i'm not sure how to approach a role that should be "normal" to me by now. your life will change though, even if it wasn't a baby that changed you, it would be something.  it can seem like those people we were BEFORE we were moms were so complex or personalized, but you haven't lost anything about your identity or personality, you have only gained another aspect to your life.  think of being that baby's mama or a partner to your mate as just an added aspect to who you are.   it can be hard to nurture your self identity when you have a newborn though, we all know how tiring it gets.  but the other mamas have had some really awesome suggestions.  what helped me was to drink my favorite kind of tea whenever it was a quiet moment and i had a chance to sit with myself and think, or listen to my favorite kinds of music (crank it up, babies love music) that reminded me of my "old life" but also slowly became my baby's fav rockin to sleep tunes, or the music that he first danced to, or the soundtrack to those awesome nursing moments.  it can seem like the only person you are now is a diaper changer, baby feeder, laundry doer, or whatever else, but you are still a woman, not just a mom, so don't be afraid to nurture that side of yourself, unapologetically.  even if its just in small doses. *hugs* I go through that every six month, and my kid is two. I just haven't found a me I can settle with yet. I do remember the bars on my window starting to look like a cage to me. That was right before I got a job, and actually got out of the house once in a while. Puff dough, I have felt that way too, like my house is my cage. When I start to feel that way, I at least try to take a walk, or even go to the grocery store just to get out of the house! Emeraldfirefly, I have been trying to think of how to respond, but when my first baby was a newborn I was so lost in the experience I didn't even think about myself at all. It is now that I am really feeling like a caretaking machine. It can be hard to be the mama, and have someone new that you have to put first. I have been putting everyone else first, and it is taking a toll on me. I am finally realizing that it is OK for me to put myself first sometimes. With a tiny baby, you have to meet their needs immediately of course, but I have learned that it is OK for my baby to cry in daddy's arms if I need a break. Sure, he may really want me, but I know he's been fed, changed, and is in loving arms being well taken care of. And mama will come back feeling so much better and ready to play after a good long walk in the crisp winter air. Writing about my feelings also helps me feel more like a real person. It is a really good way to get in touch with yourself and your feelings. Another thing that is really important for you is to keep in touch with your body. If you are hungry, eat! IF you need to pee, pee! Don't forget to take care of yourself, and always drink lots of water, especially if you are nursing. Also, this is my advice to all mamas who are feeling worn out, especially mamas with new babies-- Don't be afraid to ask for help! Most people would be glad to help, but they don't know what you need unless you ask them. We are intelligent, strong, compassionate, socially aware, politically active, and eternally nurturing. Together, we will change the face of "teen parenthood."    © Girl-Mom. All rights reserved. Since 1999!  BABY MAMA Quotes BABY MAMA Quote Pictures Popular Authors

Most Read Egg donation agencies, which help infertile couples find egg donors, have recently barraged college and university newspapers with requests for donated eggs. Demand for donated eggs has driven up prices and caused a dramatic leap in compensation for Ivy League donors. Although no concrete numbers are available, Ivy League applicants are a small minority of all egg donors. Donor matching agencies say graduate students are much more likely to donate, making undergrad eggs all the more desired. While most egg donors receive a few thousand dollars in compensation for the process (sperm donors only make a paltry hundred), Ivy League girls are the crème de la crème of the egg donation pool and routinely earn five-digit compensations.  An aspiring donor goes through an intensive screening process: agencies ask everything from favorite music, to how quickly one tans, to SAT scores, to the occurrence of asthma in the family. If a donor is paired with an infertile couple, she is treated with the drug Lupron to prime her body; the donor receives local anesthesia, and her eggs are “harvested” from the ovaries via needle, up to 40 at a time.  Although the process sounds relatively easy, the procedure is invasive and has some associated risk. As in-vitro fertilization and its associated procedures have only been popularly practiced for the last ten years, no long term analysis of the effect of egg harvesting or Lupron on the body is available.  Hilary Hanafin, a clinical psychologist with the Center for Surrogate Parenting and Egg Donation, commented on the process on the American Radio Network’s “Decision to Donate” series. She notes: “Being an egg donor is a big decision. It’s not like being a blood donor, and a 21- or 19-year-old undergraduate probably doesn’t have the capacity to understand what she’s getting into.”  And many students harbor questions over the process’ health, mental and ethical risks. “I’m worried about the type of drugs they’re putting in your body and the effect they might have,” says Rebecca E. Wexler ’05. Donation agencies assure donors that the procedure, thus far, has been relatively painless and successful. Over ten thousand babies from donor eggs have been born in the last decade and the vast majority of donors suffer no bodily harm. But Visiting Professor of Public Policy and Women’s Studies lecturer Mary Ruggie warns, “there will be more legal and ethical issues that will come up that we can’t fathom.”  Most ethicists take issue with the marketplace created around Ivy League eggs, not with the donation process itself. A healthy, college-educated woman receives around $5,000 dollars for her egg donation; first-tier college students around twice that; Harvard, Stanford, Princeton and Yale students up to ten times that amount.          Tiny Treasures LLC, a Somerville-based donation agency, creates a pool of “Extraordinary Donors.” According to their website, a donor with either an SAT over 1250, an ACT over 28, a GPA over 3.5, or enrollment at an Ivy League school, qualifies as an “Extraordinary Donor” whose eggs are worth more than three times that of a first-time, well, normal donor. A Perfect Match, a California based donation agency, currently advertises in The Crimson and posted the infamous $50,000 offer for a tall, athletic, brunette.  In July 2002, the President’s Council on Bioethics (online at www.bioethnics.gov) released “Human Cloning and Human Dignity: An Ethical Inquiry,” which raised questions about the morality of the egg donation-for-cash trade. “When the ‘products’ are human beings, the ‘market’ could become a profoundly dehumanizing force,” the committee concluded. The report went on to question the “prospect of a new eugenics” arising from developments in IVF technology.  Indeed, one donation website posted photographs of nearly 50 available egg donors. The average donor advertised an SAT score over 1300, a weight below 130 and height over five feet, eight inches. However, most egg donation agencies avoid such advertising and stress that they help match couples with suitable donors.  Egg donation agencies believe that the couple seeking donation has every legal right to, and should, investigate and decide upon their own egg donor. The agencies stress that egg donation allows couples to experience a nearly natural pregnancy, providing an alternative to adoption, which is often legally and emotionally complicated.  But Ruggie describes that a “market factor” has been created around donated eggs. “Some private insurances cover in vitro fertilization and assisted reproductive technology, but most don’t. It becomes a debate as to whether the phenomenon of infertility should be medicalized and the consequences of wealth.”  Ultimately, the issue remains complex. But one woman awaiting donated eggs who asked that she not be named said the complexities are overridden by the benefits. “This gives women the opportunity to have a child that is at least partially the genetic product of the couple,” she said. “It also allows some women to experience pregnancy who otherwise couldn’t.”   

Be the first to save!  Police nab woman, 27, in deadly stabbing Rina Perez was on her lunch break Wednesday from her job at Jackson Square Apartments when she got a bad feeling, she said. "Something just kept telling me to get to the job," Perez said. When she got back to the apartment building she manages at 1601 S. Jackson St., Perez saw "a lot of police everywhere," she said. But when she learned a man she knew had been killed there, Perez couldn't believe it, she said. Banquo "Ace" Dewond Logan, 31, died at the scene after being stabbed about noon in a third-floor apartment. Investigators from the Potter-Randall Special Crimes Unit recovered a knife at the scene and detained 27-year-old Charlene Morshay Carter. She later was arrested on a murder charge and booked into the Potter County Detention Center. Potter County Justice of the Peace Haven Dysart ordered an autopsy be performed on Logan's body today in Lubbock. Logan did not live at Jackson Square but often visited, Perez said. The attack occurred in the apartment of a friend he had helped to move out. "We were used to seeing him a lot," Perez said. Kris Yarbrough, maintenance man and night manager, said that after the stabbing, he called 911 from the manager's office, which is on the first floor. "She (Carter) came downstairs saying she was sorry, she was sorry," Yarbrough said. He said he thought Carter was an ex-girlfriend of Logan's and may have had an argument with him. Amarillo Homicides in 2004: January: 0 February: 0 March: 0 April: 0 May: 1 June: 1 July: 3 Total: 5 "Probably a 'baby-mama drama,"' Yarbrough said, referring to a suspected conflict involving Logan, Carter and Logan's current girlfriend. Perez said Logan and his girlfriend were expecting a baby this fall. "He was a real nice person," Perez said. "He was the type of person that loved kids." She said he always took time to chat with the children in the area, including her 2-year-old son. Sometimes he gave them dollar bills or bought them ice cream. "He wasn't even the type of person to have an attitude," Perez said. "He was always smiling, always joking around." Perez, who has been manager at Jackson Square for four years, said that in her job she is used to dealing with a variety of people and their problems. "(But) not something I haven't been able to handle - not until today," she said. Logan's death is Amarillo's fifth homicide this year. Three of those occurred this week, starting with a Sunday shooting that resulted in the death of Donald Paul Scholz, 23, on Tuesday. Three men have been charged in that case and two were in custody late Wednesday. On Tuesday, Kenneth Cottrell, 52, was found dead in his home at 2405 S. Crockett St. with multiple gunshot wounds. Investigators said they had few leads in that case. The Special Crimes Unit investigated 21 homicides in 2003 and seven in 2002.

Delivered, discarded Chico Classifeds Reader Comments Sign in to submit a comment: Post anonymous comment: Submit Your Comment   At a preliminary arraignment in Butte County Superior Court Tuesday, Gina Rose Grinsell, a 20-year-old Chico State sophomore accused of killing her newborn son, was charged with one count of murder and one count of assaulting a child with intent to kill. Both charges carry potential life sentences.

Prosecutors claim Grinsell strangled her baby with her bare hands after delivering it alone in her bedroom at the Kappa Sigma Delta sorority house on Cedar Street while her sorority sisters were having a party in another part of the house.

Grinsell appeared disheveled, distraught and on the verge of tears as she took her place before Judge Gerald Hermansen. She was calm as District Attorney Mike Ramsey read the grim charges against her, while many of the sorority sisters who had showed up to support her burst into tears.

The arraignment itself lasted only a few minutes. Before the proceedings began, Kappa Sigma Delta President Briana Nagle told reporters that she and the other inhabitants of the house were still in a “state of shock” over the incident. Nagle characterized Grinsell as “the most caring person I know” and as someone was always willing to help a friend in trouble.

“It’s so surreal,” she said. “It’s like it hasn’t hit yet. All the sisters are trying to carry on the best we can.” 
After the arraignment, Ramsey answered questions from reporters outside the courtroom. He said Grinsell’s baby was born healthy on the evening of April 1, while a social event involving 30-40 people went on in another part of the house. Apparently, no one heard Grinsell giving birth in her bedroom or checked to see if she was in her room. The baby, a 9.5-pound, 22-inch boy, was apparently born alive, Ramsey said, as an autopsy showed air in the baby’s lungs. The autopsy also showed bruises and marks on the baby’s neck where he had apparently been strangled within a few minutes of birth.

Grinsell may have tried to hide her pregnancy from her friends and certainly did hide it from her parents, Ramsey said. The child was found by a sorority sister the day after he was born in Grinsell’s bedroom. He had been wrapped in a plastic Wal-Mart bag and left in a bucket.

Authorities were apparently contacted by workers at a medical clinic to which Grinsell had been brought for a checkup, as her friends had become concerned about her condition.

The father of the child has not yet been found, though Ramsey said investigators were working on it. Grinsell apparently gave prosecutors a first name of a man who may be the father, but there were doubts as to the veracity of that statement. It is believed that the child was not the product of a “long-term relationship.” 
When asked to speculate on Grinsell’s possible motive, Ramsey said, “All of us need to understand that there is a huge ‘why?’ here. Here we have a young woman who appears to have thrown her child’s life away, as well as possibly her own.” 
It isn’t known whether Grinsell was aware that California’s “Safely Surrendered Baby” law allows for an unwanted child to be dropped off at a hospital with no questions asked and no charges brought. The law, which went into effect this year, was designed to prevent this type of tragedy from occurring.

Grinsell’s attorney, Dennis Lattimer, said Grinsell had never been in trouble before, was doing well in school and had the love and support of her family and friends. He declined to characterize her overall mental state, saying she had “lost a lot of blood” and was still upset and somewhat dazed from her ordeal. When asked what his defense strategy might be, Lattimer said he would be conducting his own investigation into the matter and would base his court strategy on the findings of that investigation.

Grinsell’s bail was set at $1 million. She will be formally arraigned  before Judge Robert Glusman on Monday, April 12.

        Unsubscribe   It happens every day! Men becoming dads, not by choice, but by accident.  And not with women they would choose to be their wife, but with women who will cause them 18 years of strife! Brethren, did you have the talk? I’m talking about the talk every father must have with his son. The one every grandfather must have with his grandson and the one every uncle must have with his nephew. I’m talking about the man-to-man talk about women, sex and making babies! The one where a young man is admonished to man up and don’t become an accidental dad!  What is an Accidental Dad?
                     An accident is an unexpected, unplanned or undesirable event that usually happens suddenly and produces unfortunate, unwanted or unpleasant results. Accidents normally happen through carelessness, unawareness, ignorance, or a combination of the above. One of the worse things that can happen to a man, young or old, is becoming a dad by accident. In other words, becoming a dad through carelessness, unawareness, ignorance or sin. Did you notice that accidents are always unplanned, undesirable and unpleasant? I’ve been training men for over a decade and I’ve seen countless men in my workshops and conferences who became accidental dads. Truth be told, this is a detestable experience for most men! This is just (one of) the primary reasons why an alarming number of biological fathers eventually abandon both mother and child and why homicide is the leading cause of death amongst pregnant women.  Men, listen up! Becoming an accidental dad is almost always an unpleasant, weary and irritable event! Follow me closely as I walk you through this harrowing experience… Many try to hide their displeasure from the expectant mother, but the gut wrenching tension between the two is irrefutable and becomes apparent almost instantaneously at the revelation of her pregnancy. She’s thinking he’s going to step up to the plate, be a man and take care of his child. She may even have grandeur ideas of matrimony. Or maybe lesser plans of possibly living together and getting married down the road. He on the other hand is thinking things such as:   (a) Hmmm, I wonder if this is really my kid? 
                       (b) Is she trying to trap me or what? 
                       (c) This shouldn’t have happened, we used CONDOMS for Pete’s sake! 
                       (d) I’m just not ready for a child 
                       (e) I hope she doesn’t think I’m going to marry her! 
                       (f) God, what have I done? I surely don’t love her! 
                       (g) She’s nothing to me! She just a booty call!
                       (h) That bleep bleep told me she couldn’t get pregnant
                       (i) That bleep bleep swore she was on birth control 
                       (j) That bleep bleep claimed she didn’t want to get pregnant 
                       (k) That bleep bleep told me that she had a hysterectomy
                       (l) 
                       If she doesn’t have an abortion, I’m gonna go off! 
                       (m) 
                       I’ve got to figure out how to get out of this mess! 
                       (n) 
                       I’ll kill her before she gives birth to a baby with my DNA   Sex Traps 101
There are many dangers men face, but one of the most prominent dangers is one of the least talked about amongst men.  It’s called: SEX TRAPS! When men engage in indiscriminate or casual sex or when they cohabit or choose the wrong woman to be their wife: they subject themselves to an onslaught of dangerous and sometimes deadly sex traps. For the sake of time, we’re going to focus our attention only on the sex traps related to becoming an accidental dad. Learn them well!  ((((( Sex Trap Alert )))))
                     The Wedding Trap
                     Surely you’ve heard about men and women getting married solely because she is expecting. The plot works like this. A female gets pregnant, (usually intentionally) and then using either tears, duress or feminine wiles, snares the baby’s daddy into saying, “I do!” These women mar the entire female gender with their cunning scheme. Which is having a wedding ceremony and becoming a bride by entrapment! They masterfully manipulate a man’s sense of decency, his instinctive desire to protect, his desire to be revered as a man, his moral compass, his inclination to take care of his responsibilities and his lack of knowledge about cunning females. With most men, the guilt trip works like a charm. But the decision to grudgingly marry under such coercive conditions is one all most all men deeply regret. ((((( Sex Trap Alert )))))
                     The Child Support Trap
                     The average man doesn’t understand the harsh reality of being snared in the (CSEA) Child Support Enforcement Agency. Read some of the atrocities they are forced to endure everyday.  (a) Their child support can be more than 40% of their take home pay! 
                       (b) The subversive threat of either paying child support or going to jail 
                       (c) While incarcerated they usually lose everything, job, car, house, etc. 
                       (d) If they miss a payment, they are subject to losing their driver’s license 
                       (e) The late payment fees are an excruciating 12% compounding… 
                       (f) They are classified as a dead-beat dads no matter what they do 
                       (g) They face intense stress and ill feelings between them and the baby’s mom 
                       (h) One call from the baby’s mom can land them in jail with felon criminals 
                       (i) They must face the fact that there is no ceiling on child support 
                       (j) They are subject to increased child support payments every two years 
                       (k) It is virtually impossible to get their child support payments reduced
                       (l) 
                       A felony warrant issued for their arrest for past due child support payments  C’mon, let’s be honest, what sane men would sign up for this baby’s mama drama package if they understood what they were getting into?   She’s Got Papers On You!
There are multiple critical points men don’t understand about what happens once a woman files a paternity suit against them. They don’t realize they have just been SUED. They don’t comprehend that the mother has become their adversary in fierce a lawsuit and that they are guilty until and unless they prove their innocence.  They don’t understand that from henceforth they will be viewed and treated as a CRIMINAL with a Child Support Enforcement Agent acting as their parole officer. They don’t apprehend that not only are they subject to having their driver’s license suspended, but the (CSEA) will suspend any and all of their professional licenses, ruin their credit, intercept unemployment checks and use any means necessary to destroy them financially if they pay late or fail or refuse to pay! They don’t understand that once a child support order is issued against them, the baby’s mother has legal papers that empowers her to impede or altogether destroy their lives. They don’t grasp the fact that once a female has papers on them, she can unjustly have a man incarcerated if she turns into an angry, bitter or jealous female. This happens daily! They don’t discern that these females now forcefully control how much money they will be able to retain the next 18 to 21 years. It means that in most states, they are now subject to an unjust term called: judicial discretion. This allows a judge to set child support payments, not based on a man’s actual income, but what a judge injudiciously claims he is capable of earning. Hence the term: judicial discretion.  The men don’t fathom that the states have federal incentives to set exorbitantly high child support payments. The higher the payments, the more money the states collect from the federal level! Unfair child support payments are a financial windfall to states coffers. I received this e-mail from a man who learned this evil truth the hard way.  “I just received my child support order... Justice WAS NOT served. I have to pay child support based on a salary almost two times what I make based on NO evidence other than the baby's mother claim that I was able to afford it. Please help…”  Men suffer this same injustice in the family court everyday! Jesus spoke about these unjust judges in Luke 18:2-6. The men are ordered to pay outrageous sums of money they can never afford and when they don’t pay, they are classified as deadbeat dads and hounded as if they raped, robbed or murdered someone. You read it right!  Again I ask, “What sane men would sign up for this catastrophic deal if they knew what they were in for? This is why every dad, grandfather, uncle, mentor and pastor MUST have this talk with ALL YOUNG MEN until they get this chilling truth drilled into their heads!   ((((( Sex Trap Alert )))))
                     Paternity Fraud Predators
                     I coined the phrase, “Paternity Fraud Predators” after talking with Carnell Smith, the founder and CEO of  US Citizens Against Paternity Fraud, and learning about the alarming number of females who commit a crime called paternity fraud. This is when they inform a man that he is the father of their child when he is not. The next and most important step is getting a child support order against the defrauded man. In Mr. Smith’s case, he lost a staggering $150,000 to a woman who claimed he was her baby’s daddy. After family friends urged him to take a  DNA Paternity test, he was shocked to find out that he was not the father of the child. It was a secret the mother hid from him for eleven years while she pocketed his hard earned money. In court it took her less than 30 seconds to name the true biological father of her child. The numbers are alarming! Although most women will usually swear, “He’s my baby’s daddy!” The irrefutable fact is; one out of every three men who take a DNA paternity test, turn out not to be the biological father of the child! Did you read that? 1 out of 3! These scandalous females are defrauding untold numbers of men every year!  ((((( Sex Trap Alert )))))
                     Females Shopping For Disposable Dads
                     They used to be called gold–diggers, but gold diggers is not a befitting term simply because these females are not just ripping men off financially. They are jeopardizing men’s lives and freedom. They also impact a 3 rd party - an innocent child. The scheme is simple. Find a target with steady income, seduce him, get pregnant, get a child support order against him and then order him to BE GONE!  The primary targets of these shameless she-devils are military men, professional athletes and other financially stable men. I coined the phrase “Females Shopping For Disposable Dads” because once these females start collecting child support payments, they dispose of the baby’s daddy. And, “No!” He doesn’t get to see the child. They only interact with him if he is late with or misses a payment. Or, until it is time for them to petition the court for an increase in child support.  I’ve watched these trifling hellions snag up to fifty percent of a man’s take home pay and then laugh the men to scorn. Even worse, a number of these females don’t even care about the child. For them, it’s all about the Benjamin$! They use childbirth to get paid! I know women who collect upwards of a $100,000 a year in child support from different men. Brethren, heed this warning, these hussies are ruthless!   ((((( Sex Trap Alert )))))
Can You Say, “Trojan Man!”
                     I know what some men are thinking because I hear it constantly: “Gillis, I practice safe sex!” Men listen up! Using a condom MAY prevent pregnancy. The operative word is “May!” That’s just like a man telling a woman, “I MAY marry you!” Or a child telling his parent, “I MAY go to school today!” The word “MAY” means: the likelihood or possibility of.  No this for a certainty, there are countless men who are trapped in the child support enforcement system and THEY WERE WEARING A CONDOM! These men come to my workshops constantly. If you are depending on a condom to protect you from becoming an accidental dad, all I can say is, “You are one cocksure man!” I took this warning off of the back of a Trojan condom box. Read it carefully:  Trojan ® Brand latex Condoms, when used properly, are highly effective against pregnancy – although NO CONTRACEPTIVE CAN GUARANTEE 100% effectiveness.  Let me translate it for you. If you use this condom, there is a possibility and likelihood that it MAY protect you from becoming an accidental dad. However, they cannot guarantee you won’t get her pregnant! In the event the condom fails, no condom manufacturer is going to give you any legal assistance with your paternity suit. Nor, are they going to make your child support payments. I Spotted a Young Man Without Any Sense…
                     Read this account of how many men make the perilous journey of becoming accidental dads. Proverbs 7:6-18 The Message [Emphasis added]
                       6 As I stood at the window of my house looking out through the shutters, 
                       7 Watching the mindless crowd stroll by,  I spotted a young man without any sense
8 Arriving at the corner of the street where she lived, then turning up the path to her house. 
                       9 It was dusk, the evening coming on, the darkness thickening into night. 
                       10 Just then, a woman met him--she'd been  lying in wait for him,  dressed to seduce him. 
                       11 Brazen and brash she was, restless and roaming, never at home, 
                       12 Walking the streets,  loitering in the mall, hanging out at every corner in town. 
                       13 She threw her arms around him  and kissed him, boldly took his arm and said, 
                       14 "I've got all the makings for a feast--today I made my offerings, my vows are all paid, --  She was playing church!
15 So now I've come to find you, hoping to catch sight of your face--and here you are! 
                       16 I've spread fresh, clean sheets on  my bed, colorful imported linens. 
                       17 My bed is aromatic with spices and exotic fragrances. 
                       18 Come,  let's make love all night, spend the night in ecstatic lovemaking!  Did you read the intelligence report on these impudent females? They lie in wait, they dress to seduce men and they throw themselves on men making it almost impossible for a man to resist having sex with them. So how does a man avoid their well-laid booby traps?  Read verse 7, again! He has to become a man who possesses some common sense! I’ve given you enough crucial information to help you be that type of man. You now understand what’s at jeopardy. Read what other wise men say about these venomous skirts. Proverbs 5:3-4 Amplified Bible [Emphasis added]
                         3 For the lips of a loose woman drip honey as a honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil; 
                       4  But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged and devouring sword. Proverbs 6:24-28 Amplified Bible [Emphasis added]
                         24 To keep you from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a loose woman. 
                         25 Lust not after her beauty in your heart, neither let her capture you with her eyelids. 
                       26 For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a piece of bread, and  the adulteress stalks and snares [as with a hook] the precious life [of a man].  Men, I leave you with this charge, “Young or old, don’t be a man who does not posses common sense. Be a man of wisdom, righteousness and holiness. Be a man who is the master of his  sex drive!” If you allow your sex drive to rule you, it may be pleasurable for a season, but make no mistake about it, you are most likely headed down a perilous path of pain and regret! How do men end up becoming accidental dads? By carelessness, unawareness, ignorance and by living in SIN!  When you become a dad, you want to do so with a virtuous, trustworthy and loving WIFE! Not with a casual sex partner, one-night stand, booty call, stripper, party girl, super freak, gold-digger or some other wanton female who is going to turn this normally joyous occasion into a perpetual nightmare! Here’s my final charge, read it carefully! Proverbs 7:24-25 The Message [Emphasis added]
                       24 So, friends, listen to me, take these words of mine most seriously. 25  Don't fool around with a woman like that; don't even stroll through her neighborhood. Be a man and MAN UP! Avoid the sex traps! Be the master of you sex drive. Learn to choose your mate wisely! Don’t become an accidental dad!  Have an opinion about this article? We want to hear it!
