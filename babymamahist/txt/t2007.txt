The Baby Mama war is on and Kim and Sarah are playing it out in the press. In the new issue of Essence Magazine, the high-self esteem and very intelligent Kim Porter says: It’s one thing when you don’t know  (the man in the relationship); then you get a pass. But if you know and you’re still doing wrong, then that’s a problem. I’m not going to befriend, or even deal with someone who would go there” Now it’s time for Kim to ride on Sarah, she says she won’t let Diddy’s kids go near Sarah’s daughter, their own blood sister: Christian’s got two beautiful sisters. He ain’t thinking about the other one. , trust me when I tell you. That situation is over there, and this is over here and I ain’t got nothing to do with that” Someone tell this broad she has a lot to do with it. We can hear Kim Porter on the phone ridin’ on Sara’s voicemail now, “who is getting more checks b*tch”?  Essence scans via Gheto Fabu  Ask YOUR

  Hi Hog,  My boyfriend of 8 months has a child with someone else. 
I also have a child with someone else. But his ex is always calling him saying 
how much she screwed up and how much she loves him. But she left him and their 
daughter. I have no respect for her. 

He doesn't tell her to stop calling because he doesn't want to be mean. He just 
makes me deal with it and I don't think it's fair. 

They talk on the phone and he said he will always be there for her when she 
needs someone. I don't feel he should go out of his way to always be there for 
her. Why do they need to know what's going on in each other's lives? I only talk 
to my ex when it's about my daughter.  So when my boyfriend talks to his ex she always brings 
up the past and talks about them getting back together. I told him how I feel 
but it's like he thinks it's a joke. I think he likes two girls fighting over 
him. I just don't know if I can deal with this. I don't know if that's 
selfish. It's makes me angry, jealous, and worry all the time.  - N Hog's Relationship Advice: Wow. You guys are carrying more baggage than will fit in 
the overhead compartment and seat floor in front of you.

Yes, his baby's mama is trying to get him back.

Yes, it would seem that he enjoys the attention. 

Will he leave you to go back to her?

Hmm...

This is tricky because he needs to see his child. But you're right, he shouldn't 
be encouraging his baby mama's behavior by allowing her to get sentimental. Your situation is the reason that Albert Einstein 
coined the phrase "Baby Mama Drama." Your dude needs to be straightforward with his baby's 
mama.

He also needs to get some sort of court order that guarantees he will be able to 
see his child. And he needs to be honest with you about his 
feelings. It's okay for a guy to have friends who are girls outside the 
relationship, but not when those girls want to f*ck him and kiss him and 
suck on his jammy like it was the straw in the bottom of her almost-empty Pina 
Colada. <Insert sound effect of enthusiastic slurping.> To win any negotiation, you need to be willing to walk 
away. As painful as it may be, can you walk away from him?

If you can, then ask him to be a man and make the decision: Does he want to get 
back with his baby-mama or be with you? Because he can't have you both.

NOTE: But if he could, that would be pretty cool. Because there'd 
be threesomes and cat-fights. 

Yeah, of course he likes 2 girls fighting over him. If feels great! What 
an ego boost! You girls are used to guys hitting on you and and fussing over 
you. For us guys, we rarely have 1 girl who wants us!  So you need to show him that you will not allow this 
current situation to continue. Don't threaten him. Don't get angry. There 
is a reason he is not with her and he's with you. So you are obviously 
doing something right in your relationship with him. <Insert sound effect of enthusiastic slurping.>

Show him that you love him. And remind him that you are woman to be 
respected. And if he truly cares for you and loves you, he will stop the 
games. HA HA HA! Just kidding! Men are pigs! He's going to 
totally sha-boink her! Then he will get caught. Then you will dump him. Then 
he'll be back with his baby's mama. Then she'll start acting like her old self 
and leave him again. Then he'll be alone. And he'll be spending every night with 
his old-old girlfriend that met on the internet: ".jpg"  It's your job to save him from himself! This is the 
role of women in American society. To lift a man from his base desires and make 
him want to be a better person. If your dude wants to keep his baby's mama in his life, 
this is very delicate. He still cares for her. But why?

He needs to focus his love and attention on his new life with you. 

The best thing that could happen is that his baby's mama finds a new
man. Then she will stop obsessing over your man.

So my advice to you? Find her a new man!

Go out and put up her profile on every dating site, MySpace, hell -- post her 
picture on every telephone pole in town!

Get this woman a date!

Once she has this need satisfied, she will stop yearning for what was... because 
she will be too happy with what is.

By the way, this is what your boyfriend should be doing, too. Being happy with
what is instead of talking about what was. <Insert sound effect of enthusiastic slurping.> Word, hogsta.

Never mind the precious peanut. Where my damn diamonds? (BTW, this is us in 2004; I didn’t just go have a baby and blog the same day.) I so did not get a push present. And believe me, my pregnancy and delivery bit. Gifts for new mothers are all the rage these days, say propoganda sites like BabyCenter.com. Said The New York Times yesterday: In a more innocent age, new mothers generally considered their babies to be the greatest gift imaginable. Today, they are likely to want some sort of tangible bonus as well. This bonus goes by various names. Some call it the “baby mama gift.” Others refer to it as the “baby bauble.” But it’s most popularly known as the “push present.” That’s “push” as in, “I the mother, having been through the wringer and pushed out this blessed event, hereby claim my reward.” Or “push” as in, “I’ve delivered something special and now I’m pushing you, my husband/boyfriend, to follow suit.” This is offensive on so many levels I don’t know where to begin. Yes, I do. First off, no one I know got diamond baubles or pricey art work just for having a baby. Secondly, no mom I know would ever demand such a thing as the price of pushing out a pup. But thirdly, if a new daddy wanted, on his own volition, to bestow his honey with a token of his love and appreciation, what the hell is wrong with that? Fourth, the article denies it, but this smacks of one more corporate plot to invent another gift-giving occasion. Clara Jeffery of Mother Jones captures my sentiment exactly in a blog post titled, “Here’s Your Damn Baby, Now Where Are My #@%&ing Diamond Earrings?” It is not the fact that Moms are getting a token of their hard work that bugs me, it is that you know that the diamond industry has their hands in this. Just as they invented a “tradition” of diamond wedding rings, the “three months salary” rule, and the “three-stone anniversary ring.” Hey, you can hear DeBeers’ pitchmen saying: Why not a carat for each pound of baby? Don’t you care, Dad? Here’s the push present I’d want: sleep.  Angela Nazario is Larry Fitzgerald’s Baby Mama! (Photos) 24 Responses to “Angela Nazario is Larry Fitzgerald’s Baby Mama! (Photos)” Recent Comments Right Fielders Tweets Follow Us on Twitter! **Updated photo thanks to one of our readers below** What’s the deal with those Arizona Cardinals players?  TMZ is reporting that Angela Nazario (I can’t find anymore photos of her except the one above), is claiming that Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald, Jr. is her unborn baby’s daddy!!  See a biography of Angela here!
 Angela claims that she and Fitzgerald had a sexual relationship and he is not denying that fact, but he is requesting that a DNA paternity test be done on the baby after it is born.   See the court docs here.  Nazario wants child support from Fitzgerald (cha-ching!), and he states that he will provide that if he is declared the father.   A source close to Nazario revealed that Larry wanted her to “hide out” in Arizona and wanted her to have an abortion.  There are claims that he tried to bribe her with houses and cars but when she refused his bribes, he said that he “didn’t need this all over the news like Matt Leinart”.  I don’t think Larry will be posting this news on his website.  Heh heh. More photos of Angela Nazario will be below as they become available.
 **Thank you to one of our readers for the tip on the updated photo of Angela…**

  Brian Urlacher's Baby Mama Drama Other Interesting Stories send a tip Newsletter Istaverse contribute About all our citiesone convenient app We love watching him run from sideline to sideline, snuffing out running backs, or intercepting passes with one hand and running the ball back fifty yards.  Off the field, however, Brian Urlacher just doesn't seem very bright. The Bears' star middle linebacker finds himself back in court in a battle over custody and visitation rights for his two-year-old son, Kennedy.  Kennedy's mother, Tyna Robertson, revealed over thirty text messages Urlacher sent her since January using language that makes us suspect that Urlacher might be a guest commentator on some of our posts.  Yesterday, Urlacher told a Will County judge that he "couldn't remember" sending messages to Robertson that suggested she was raising Kennedy to be a "little pussy," among other things. Granted, Robertson isn't exactly the squeaky clean sort, having once sued "Lord of the Dance" maestro Michael Flatley for rape, asking for $35 million in the process.  A judge threw that suit out and allowed Flatley to sue Robertson for defamation of character and extortion.  We're not saying she's a gold digger, but there is such a thing as a life change, and often the catalyst is a baby. Robertson and Urlacher might want to consider the effects that their arguing has on young Kennedy.  As he grows up, it'll be fairly easy for Kennedy to look up articles on his proud football playing dad and see that he once called his mother a "hooker" and that she should "make one of (her) pimps drive (her) around."

ON BLAST! LOVER OF DOWNLOW R&B SINGER SPEAKS!!
 January 29, 2007: One of MediaTakeOut.com\'s faithful readers named J.B. asked us to put an R&B; artist ON BLAST!. Apparently J.B. and this artist have been in a down low relationship for some time and J.B. just discovered that the artist is cheating. Before we put this R&B; artist On Blast!, we\'ve decided to give him one last chance to make things right. MediaTakeOut.com will give the artist (who we know regularly visits our site) 7 days to call J.B. and apologize. If after 7 days, he hasn\'t apologized, we\'ll let everyone know who he is. Here is J.B.\'s sad story: 
    For the past 6 months, I have been in a DL relationship with R&B; singer [The Artist]. We met in Atlanta after he did a show for a music fest on the south side of town. I was a little disappointed in his performance at first because I am use to seeing him bring the house down, but he was high and tipsy. We greeted backstage where he slipped me his number and I met him later on that night at his hotel. I don\'t think his crew knows because we went to another room once they fell out from getting blazed.     He was not sure how to take me and vice versa, but after a few long night conversations and connections, he knew I could be trusted. Everything was all good until his baby mama drama blew out the water. She has not accepted the fact that they are no longer together, as far as he told me. I even flew out to Chicago to stay with him a few days during this mess his ex girl created.     After a few weeks of non stop drama with her and her crew, I told him it was best that we be friends from afar or until the drama she was causing simmered down. I was at peace about the situation until I found out he was seeing some other guy and some other girl on and off through a close friend in Chicago. Not only do I feel betrayed, but I feel like I was violated. I was looking to marry him, but our connection really began to blossom as he sent me gifts and love notes all the time.     Given that he has a son and was trying to remove himself from a bad situation, I stood by the idea of having a friend and lover that built up to more than sex. We went out when he was in town and even had dinner in public together. I comforted him through his personal struggles day and night and even tried do improve his album sales of the last album (that did not do hot on the charts).     I am a huge fan of his music, but I refuse to be a sideline ho and I feel the other [EXPLETIVES] and hoes he playing should know the dog they messing with. I prayed things would never come to this, but [the Artist] needs to know that once a good dude goes bad, he\'s gone forever. All dogs don\'t go to heaven. You had a great thing with me. I carry my own and never asked you for anything. I will go on record and say that I have messed with other industry [EXPLETIVES], but I never allowed myself to get attached or drawn because of [EXPLETIVE] like this.

Big Screen Little Screen  Poehler is Tina Fey's 'Baby Mama' 2 Responses Leave a Comment  Ted Zee - Seattle, WA Tips & correspondence: ted.bsls[at]gmail.com  Diversionary Recent Posts  SlashFilm has the first image available for the Tina Fey and Amy Poehler reunion vehicle, Baby Mama, due out from Universal in the Spring.  In what seems like not much of a stretch from her 30 Rock persona, Fey plays Kate, a 37 year-old single executive who’s looking to have her first child.  After learning that she’s unable to have one naturally, she pegs lower-class South Philly girl Angie (Poehler) as her surrogate.  Baby comedy turns buddy comedy when Angie loses her place and Kate finds her at her doorstep. Seems promising (if not predictable) enough, though potential would be higher with the former SNL writer pals as scribes, which they were not. Forecast is for broad comedy as screenplay and (first-time) direction is by Michael McCullers, who penned two Austin Powers sequels, as well as Undercover Brother.  Greg Kinnear, Dax Shepard, and Sigourney Weaver also star.  Release is scheduled for April 18th, 2008.

NFLer Osi Umenyiora’s Got Some BABY MAMA DRAMA!!!
 December 4, 2007: MediaTakeOut.com reported to you a few months ago that NFL Pro-Bowler Osi Umenyiora and a Tennessee woman named Sharika welcomed a beautiful baby boy into the world. Well it's now looking like the relationship between Osi and Sharika has hit a rough patch. You see, one of MediaTakeOut.com's faithful readers ran into Shakira at a popular Nashville nightspot. And our nosy reader overheard the former video vixen talking to one of her girlfriends about her relationship with the NFL baller. Here' what our reader overheard her say: Any athlete would love to have a video model, but I never claimed him as my boyfriend. Who cares if he thinks I'm not wife material. I managed to have his baby, I don't need Osi for anything else...."  EDITOR'S UPDATE - Sharika contacted us personally to refute the claims of our reader. According to Sharika, her and Osi are doing just fine. Well that's good to hear - cause they do make a great looking couple...

 Get 4 Free Issues! NBA star, Latrell Sprewell, most recently with the Minnesota Timberwolves, is being sued by the mother of his four children. Candace Cabbil, Latrell’s baby-mama says the ball player broke a long term "cohabitation" agreement the two made in 1989 when they first met, stating that Latrell would share his life and fortune with her. This suit in effect involves and affects the couple’s four kids, ages 3, 7, 8, and 11. Candace says the star recently got rough with her in their N.Y., home, as well as has been giving her less money for their children and other household expenses and becoming less involved in their family. She also alleges that Latrell has a 16-year-old child with another woman, that she has had to take guardianship over.  Candace says she had to quit her own job, in a hospital, after having their first child and was promised that she would not have to worry about being taken care of, despite not getting married or putting her name on the lease of their $3 million home.

 I believe it, because this person has a history of violent behavior.  Did he not attack his basketball coach?

Not up to vintage "Scrubs" standards, but an improvement nonetheless, if for no reason than that JD resembled an actual human being for most of the episode. (And I think we have to allow for some percentage of whimsical prima donna JD -- the guy who refused to accept that Kim could hate his hair -- because that was a part of the character even in the slightly more realistic seasons.) We even got our first mostly heartfelt scene between JD and Dr. Cox since maybe "My Lunch" and "My Fallen Hero." The Kim/pregnancy plot was a bad idea from start to finish -- not least which because it only allowed the very funny Elizabeth Banks to actually be funny in her very first episode and this one -- but at least we've come to a reasonable conclusion to it. No dead baby angst (other than whatever JD felt during the stupid fake miscarriage portion of last season), but also no more "trapped in an unhealthy relationship" angst. The show already has two other babies in Isabel and JD Cox, so if the writers don't want to show JD interacting much with his own, they don't have to, and if they want to show how weird he would be with a newborn, they can do that, too. The video game subplot was pretty lightweight, but it allowed for the Janitor's completely demented (and, I have to assume, improvised by Neil Flynn) monologue to his vanquished video foe, and there were other funny things on the margins like the homeless Dr. Kelso waiting for his 'za, Fun-Sized Intern struggling to speak with a normal tone, and the stealth first appearance of the late Nurse Laverne's twin sister. (For those who don't know, Bill Lawrence promised the actress that if he killed Laverne off and the show got renewed, he'd recast her as Laverne's twin so she wouldn't be out of work -- and so the show wouldn't be without one of its many comic voices.) And, of course, any episode with Colin Hay emerging from Kim's birthing canal can't be all bad, can it? What did everybody else think?

Month after month, year after year, those payments!  So I called my baby girl, Kareesha, to come over to my house, and when she got there, I said to her, "Baby girl, I want you to take this last check over to your mother's house and tell her that this is the last check she's ever going to get from me, and I want you to come back and tell me the expression that's on her face."  So my baby girl took the check over to her. I was really anxious to hear what she had to say and what she looked like.. As my baby girl walked through the door, I said, "Now what did she have to say?" "She told me to tell you that you ain't my daddy, and to watch the expression on your face.

  OK, I was out of pocket when this hit the media, but what do you think Eddie Murphy and his management team are saying since DNA tests prove that he is the father of Melanie “Scary Spice” Brown’s baby? As you know, Murphy would not claim paternity until DNA tests had been performed. Now that the world knows he’s the daddy, hopefully these parents will stay focused on the well-being of this child, Eddie’s other children and not their relationship.

Community Howard Regional Health Indiana needs reasonable environmental rulemaking GOOD TIMES: New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is shown in this June 2005, file photo arriving with his girlfriend, actress Bridget Moynahan, at team owner Robert Kraft's home in Brookline, Mass. GOOD TIMES: New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is shown in this June 2005, file photo arriving with his girlfriend, actress Bridget Moynahan, at team owner Robert Kraft's home in Brookline, Mass. BOSTON — Actress Bridget Moynahan, former girlfriend of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, is pregnant and Brady is the father, Moynahan’s publicist said Monday.

The glamorous pair split up late last year after a three-year relationship. Brady, a two-time Super Bowl MVP, has since been seen with lingerie model Gisele Bundchen, and media outlets have reported the two are dating.

A Dec. 15 statement from Moynahan’s publicist that said that Moynahan and Brady parted ways several weeks earlier.

On Monday, Moynahan’s publicist, Christina Papadopoulos, said in a statement to The Associated Press that the actress “is over three months pregnant. Former boyfriend Tom Brady is the father.”

“Privacy and consideration is appreciated at this time,” the statement said. “No further comments will be made.”

News of the pregnancy was first reported by the New York Post on Sunday. The Post quoted Papadopoulos as saying the actress was feeling “healthy and excited.”

Messages left by The Associated Press with Brady’s agent, Donald Yee, were not returned Monday.

Patriots spokesman Stacey James told the AP, “I think it would be inappropriate to comment.”

Moynahan, 35, has appeared in films such as “Coyote Ugly,” “I, Robot” and the ABC television series “Six Degrees.” She grew up in Longmeadow, Mass.

Brady, 29, who has led the Patriots to three NFL titles, was named one of People magazine’s “50 Most Beautiful People” in 2002.
